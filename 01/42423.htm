            Two things I observed.
<br />1. You have a write protected media(which either you have it intentionally or Faulty device)
<br />2. Your display driver is crashing frequently.
<br />Download and run HDTune .
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the Disk where OS is installed.
<br />
<br />Make screenshots of the following
<br />the health
<br />the error scan
<br />the benchmark
<br />Post back the screenshots.

    <title>Afterglow have a completely wireless headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enendaveyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Afterglow have a completely wireless headset</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>After looking through ebay and sites and gumtree to try and find an affordable half decent headset within my budget, I missed a few deals and was out bidded for the usual brands.</p>
<p><br />
However I stubbled upon the Afterglow AG7's, order a paid which got cancelled by gamestop, then they listed AG9's for the same price, it turns out the AG9's replace the AG7's and have fixed some of the issue so alls good, anyway they turn up today and I am
 well impressed.</p>
<p><br />
First off they are completly wireless, no cable to the controller, they have a dongle type thing (looks like a usb stick) you put in the xbox, mine where already sinced, and the sound quality if good, better than my T XP400's on the xbox one, and better than
 the MS stereo headset, the volume controllers work well and they are comfortable.</p>
<p><br />
The only issue I have, is the mic has to be very close to you mouth for the mic monitoring to work, and if its not working some ppl might find you a little quiet.</p>
<p>And the headcup things are a little small, so if you have big ears they might be a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><br />
If you need to move the headset to the side to hear the mrs, it doesn't seem to find a fit for half on half off (more my issue I think), and eating with them on is hard work lmao.</p>
<p>I bought mine from gamestop UK for £60, there RRP is $100 (i know the US RRP don't know what the UK RRP is sorry)</p>
<p>However for what you get they are exceptional value for money and worth a look IMO.</p>

<p>Well that's 2 so far. &nbsp;XP800 from Turtle Beach and the Afterglow. &nbsp;Im not impressed by either, and still a little salty that after this long, there are no other options. &nbsp;I don't want to plug my *** controller into my headset. &nbsp;There are tons of great headsets
 out there, but Microsoft cant seem to figure out how to apply them to their system. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the Afterglow AG7, they suck. I received them in August of 2015 through Amazon US. Cost me $100 US. The mic was REALLY REALLY low. So, I dealt with it for awhile. Then about a month in the headset started disconnecting from it's dongle. The only way
 to get it to reconnect was to shut the XB1 off then back on. This happened about 5-6 times a week. I'm a daily ganer. I also use my XB1 for movies, music, and TV. So, I used the AG7 a considerable amount. Then, I noticed that when I'd play games like COD BO3
 or Smite, my sound would be reversed. The action would be on the right but the sound would be in the left ear. I contacted PDP (Makers of Afterglow products) and they suggested trying the firmware upgrade/ I tried it, and it didn't work. Same issue. So, I
 returned the product, and the warranty allowed me to receive the upgraded AG9 headset. I've had it since January. Mic is STILL the same. People cannot hear me unless I speak very loudly. The sound STILL occurs on the wrong side of the action. This isn't in
 every game but it happens at a crucial point. WHen playing FPS games, you need to know from what direction the enemy is coming. I can say that I do not get disconnected often, maybe once in 2 months. But, now I had a problem that is much worse. The AG7 had
 a retractable mic which was neat. I liked that feature. But the AG9 has a detatchable mic. Which is also a nice feature, but now my headset has static coming from the mic's connection. And half the time my party cannot hear me, unless I jiggle the mic, which
 causes more static. So, my suggestion is to stay away from ANY Afterg;low products. They've been crappy for years. I've had a couple of controllers over the years. And the AG7/AG9 is no different.
</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm still searching for a wireless solution (With no chat cable). And it's sad that my console of choice is so tight-fisted that I can't get one. &nbsp;Sony could care less about it's customers but guess what.. the PS4 has NORMAL BLUETOOTH. I'm
 starting to feel like I've wasted my money on the XBOX. </p>

<p>Have you tried removing the ubs adaptor and plugging it back in?</p>
<p>The mic isn't the same on the 7's to the 9's and you can bend it to curve round your face and bring it nearer to your mouth if you need to. Is the mic boom in correctly as it has like a lip, if any mic isn't in right it will have static.</p>

    <title>XBox One Controller driver problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakit0  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One Controller driver problem</h2>
                    <p>I just got a XBox One controller and Windows didn't detect it when I plugged it in. This issue is present regardless of the controller (my brother got another one) and is only happening on my computer (my brother is doing fine). I'm connecting it via a Micro
 USB cable (the cable works fine with other devices or connecting the controller to my brother's PC).</p>
<p>The controller vibrates, and the light flashes a few times before shutting down. Device Manager states a "driver problem" and updating drivers doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a thread with a similar issue, and it was solved by manually updating drivers, selecting "Microsoft Xbox One Controller". That option does not appear on my list (similar options, like "XBox One Controller" do appear, but don't work; the point is to
 choose "Microsoft Xbox One Controller" specifically).</p>
<p>Of course, Windows support was no use at all, suggesting I used the XBox Accessories application, which I did. The app just launches and tells me to "Connect an Xbox One controller to start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally succeeded by downloading the Windows 7/8 drivers. Games and system seem to recognize the controller now. Still, the XBox Accesories application doesn't, displaying the same text. I thought "ok, let's update drivers now" and -boom- blue screen.</p>
<p>I had to uninstall and reinstall drivers to get it working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though games do recognize the controller, I want to have access to all features of a One controller, namely the XBox Accesories app (which I understand will let me remap the controller) and updated and functioning drivers, since it is what I paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi jaKiT0,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, Windows 10 will install the latest driver needed for your Xbox One Controller once it connected via USB cable. Based on the information that you provided, I'm suspecting that the issue could be either the Xbox Accessories app on your computer or
 a corrupted driver file stored on it. To better assist you, kindly provide us the following information below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you confirm if both controllers work fine on your brother's computer?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling the Xbox Accessories app on your computer?</li><li>Can you also tell us the troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far when you contacted the Windows Support?</li></ul>
<p>

</p><p>First of all, I have found what could be the issue. I was connecting the controller through a Hub (and I need to, connecting it directly to the computer would be suboptimal for me). Connecting the controller directly to the computer's USB ports installs
 the right drivers and the controller shows up on the XBox Accesories app.</p>
<p>When connected back to the Hub, the controller is not recognized again at all.</p>
<p>I feel kinda stupid for not trying this earlier, but at least it seems the problem is there. I have never had issues with the Hub, and my previous controller (XBox 360, wired) worked just fine through the Hub. I have tried disconnecting everything else in
 the Hub, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, answering to your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both controllers are working flawlessy on my brother's computer, and both get recognized by the XBox Accesories app.</li><li>I have tried reinstalling, of course. To no effect, of course.</li><li>To be clear, I did not contact Windows Support, I just read lots of threads and posts, among them, official Windows Support pages. This post is as far as I'm getting "contacting Windows Support".</li></ul>
<p>I'm guessing I now have to get the system to detect the controller through the Hub somehow.</p>

<p>I appreciate your reply. Can you tell us if you recently installed the latest Windows Update on your computer? If so, it's possible that a corrupted file is preventing you from using the controller. I recommend that you download and run the
<em><strong>Windows Update troubleshooter </strong></em>to scan and repair corrupted files on your computer. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to download the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I suggest that you perform a clean boot on your computer to eliminate software conflicts. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps. Also, I recommend that you download and run the Windows app troubleshooter to
 scan and repair your Xbox Accessories App. You may refer to this <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to download the troubleshooter.</p>

<p>Well, nothing worked. The Windows App troubleshooter did state that "Windows Store cache may be damaged", so it reset the application. Still, I ran a second diagnostic (and a third, and a fourth) and it gave me the same message again. I tried all of your
 other suggestions, to no effect. The controller is not recognized through the hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the hub drivers and preventing the system from disconnecting the device to save power, but it didn't work. I hope to try with another hub tomorrow, but I fear I'll encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update states I'm up to date and the latest feature update is 1803, installed a month ago. This update, by the way, started causing some strange, though not really problematic behaviour in my old 360 controller and a few software. These were the
 first issues I had with Windows 10 and its forced updates in a few years, and what made me purchase the new controller (the 360 wire was a bit damaged, still, and the sticks were going increasingly crazy).<br />
I don't know if this is relevant. Maybe I could try reinstalling the update? I don't know if this is even possible, I try to steer clear of Windows Update as much as I can, due to the lack of choice it offers. It definitely doesn't show up on the "Uninstall
 updates" window.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: When I plug the controller through the hub, the USB connection shows up in the tray, as if a drive were connected.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. May I know if you tried to uninstall the recent Windows Update in the Windows Update history? Also, can you tell us if you're still getting the same error message when you connect the controller through a hub?<br />

<p>The only Updates I may uninstall are a couple Visual C++ (from a few months ago), and security updates for both Windows and Flash.</p>
<p>The issue persists (though there is no error message) when connecting the controller through the hub. I could not get another hub to test, but I have tried reinstalling drivers for the hub. It didn't work.</p>
<p>It's funny, since I've been seeing posts from people using hubs to connect their controllers to the XBox and it works just fine. It's pretty weird it doesn't work on my computer.</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. Generally, It is recommended that you connect your Xbox One controller directly to your computer so that your Windows 10 will get the latest driver for it and to use the button mapping on the Xbox Accessories app. However,
 using a USB Hub to connect your Xbox One controller to your computer may cause you unable to use it properly. Since your USB Hub also has its own driver installed, this could affect your Windows 10 to detect the driver of your Xbox One controller. It is possible
 that your Windows 10 is detecting your USB Hub driver as the driver for the Xbox One controller. Due to this condition, it also affects you to use the button mapping on the Xbox Accessories app. In this case, It would be best that you connect your controller
 directly to your computer instead so that you can be able to use it properly. As another option, you can use the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10 to connect your Xbox One Controller. It lets you connect up to 8 controllers to your computer through a wireless
 connection at once. To know more about the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10, you may refer to this

    <title>Issues with the Photo App and the SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barrielipscombe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with the Photo App and the SD card</h2>
                    <p>Before I start I should add the proviso that this may be a local issue (ie., specific to me and something I did caused it) or it may be a more general issue (which I believe it is).</p>
<p>The problem began when I used the method described here (&nbsp;<a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/windows8/surface-tip-microsd-content-libraries-metro-apps-144658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winsupersite.com/article/windows8/surface-tip-microsd-content-libraries-metro-apps-144658</a>)
 to attach my Photos on my SD card to the Photo app on Surface. It appeared to work well with the Photo app finding all pics, folders, and sub-folders on the card. However shortly after a problem appeared whereby the Photo app no longer recognised all the folders
 and suddenly was displaying empty frames in the main 'My pictures' folder on the C: drive. These frames were blank but had the files numbers of each photo that was missing in the top left hand corner (e.g., DSC 000567), and they related to deleted files that
 HAD BEEN DELETED VIA THE DESKTOP and not the deletion control in the Photo app.</p>
<p>I struggled for a long time to try and understand what had happened and what was wrong. All the other Photo related apps (e.g., MEMORYLAGE) still worked perfectly, finding and displaying all pics on the SD card and no blank frames, but it seemed the Photo
 app that came with Surface was locked into a problem (and no amount of Re-starting, uninstalling and reinstalling, etc. could fix the issue).</p>
<p>Eventually I realised the problem related to the Photo app's inability to 'Refresh' it's connection with the SD Card. Whatever is in the Photo folder on the SD card when the connection (via the Library) is made, is LOCKED. So if you delete a photo through
 any other method than using the Photo app it still thinks the photo is there. Likewise it will not find any folder placed into the PHOTOS folder on the SD card after the link is made (or any renamed folder). So for example, if you copy more pics into the Photo
 Folder via a USB stick connection, the Photo app simply does not see them. Likewise if you delete folders the app will show empty versions of the deleted folder.</p>
<p>The solution is to make a new folder (maybe 'Photos2' or whatever), copy all the files into this folder, disconnect the original 'photo' folder through the 'Library Management' command and then connect the new 'Photos2' folder. Then suddenly the empty frames
 disappear and all the folders (and sub-folders) are recognised again. </p>
<p>However the problem still persists in the sense that adding pics or folders to the 'Photos2' folder on the SD still leads to them being ignored or not recognised.</p>
<p>This is a very odd problem for, as I said, NONE of the other apps suffer this issue. They all quite happily 'refresh' and recognise what is currently on the SD card. Only the Photo App is locked to whatever the state of play was when the SD Card was linked.
</p>
<p>As I said maybe this is just me, but if not I hope this post may help other people with some variation of the same problem. However if this is my fault and someone knows what I did to cause it, let me know :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I am having similar issues but I used a slightly different technique to add my SDCard. I used symbolic links instead of mounting the SDCard to an ntfs folder.&nbsp; Files added to existing subfolders in the SDCard picture library do not show up in the photo
 app. Files inside folders added to the SDCard picture library sometimes show up as gray squares,&nbsp;but usually&nbsp;don't show up at all. Files deleted from the photo app turn into grey squares. Photos deleted from explorer are still viewable in the photo app.

<p>... although it kinda misses the point. It is not that the App is incorrectly installed or un-updated.</p>
<p>I have done all the things mentioned (more than once), and I now believe the issue is more to do with an inherent design problem with the App itself. Unless, of course, someone can show me what I (and others) are doing wrong.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that but sadly it did not work. I just realised I have the same problem with the Video app supplied with Surface. It will only show videos there when I linked the card. However 'memorylarge'&nbsp; (another media player app) shows all my videos which
 will then play using the Microsoft video app. Once played they disappear from view again. Obviously there is some issue with the Microsoft apps. The Weather App for example told me to expect a 'sand storm' in Taunton, Somerset yesterday. Lol.</p>
<p>That said I am still happy with the Surface, just don't use the apps that come with it!</p>

            I am having the same problem. Im using both the Videos app as well as the&nbsp;MobileHD app and I had to pay for&nbsp;the latter&nbsp;which adds insult to injury. I mean the very purpose of the media folders is to show what is on your drive, how can they fail to do that?
<br />
I like the surface very much, but these kind of issues will soon be the last drop for me.&nbsp;It's late May and still no progress on the topic. I'm beginning to think that the MS team isn't working jack squat on this issue.

    <title>What are &#39;no name&#39; hidden fat 32 15Gb, and the unformatted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaymt  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are &#39;no name&#39; hidden fat 32 15Gb, and the unformatted primary 16.0mb partititons in my hard drive for&#63; &#43; Dual boot question</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Have posted in Repair and recovery thread, because this seems the best place out of listed options to post a question about drives. Am not trying to repair or recover anything right now.</p>
<p>My Asus hard drive partitions, as shipped from factory, are as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>(C) NTFS Active 100GB&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary. System, Boot, pages file, active, crash dump</p>
<p>
</p><p>(None) NO NAME Hidden Fat 32 Primary 15GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>(D) NTFS Primary 350.75GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (all data in this drive survives a factory reset)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(None) unformatted primary 16.0 mb EFI System</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are these partitions that have no drive letter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to install another o.s for Dual boot, do I still just use Windows disc management to shrink (C) by a safe amount, then create other partitions in 'C', or is there anything about the current partition set up of my hard drive that would get in the
 way?</p>
<p>There has been a problem with the 'free space' created by the shrink process being seen as inaccessible by the second os, so install can't take place. Windows was given 52GB in the shrink process, so almost half of (C) drive remains.&nbsp; The person who is helping
 me to do this is guessing that the nature and position of these partions in relation to each other is causing this issue.</p>
<p>

                    <p>One day I tryed to boot my computer and got a 0xc00000f error. I looked up many guides online, and most of them asked me to run Bootrec, however, only one of the four operations works, ScanOs. The first two get an "I/O error" and the last one can't find
 the system. I've tried deleting my bcd, but no dice. Please help</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1cb22997-0449-4495-81f2-1fdb6eada357" title="WillPinder">WillPinder</a>,</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>I/O error</strong> usually occurs when a hardware is non-accessible. But there are multiple reasons why this happening from Hardware to software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try some troubleshooting steps to drill down on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our first option will be a clean boot to determine if a driver or program is having a conflict with the drive. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key on your keyboard and on the search box, type <strong>msconfig</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>Task Manager</strong>, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then <strong>restart the computer</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can use this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for reference on how to perform a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Once you are done with the said troubleshooting step, please refer to
<strong>Reset the computer to start normally after the clean boot troubleshooting&nbsp;</strong>on the same article.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this could be a hardware issue, let's perform a check disk to diagnose the hard drive.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key on your keyboard and on the search box, type <strong>CMD</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong> from the results and click&nbsp;<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>On the command prompt window, copy and paste this command and hit <strong>Enter
</strong>key: <strong>chkdsk /r /f</strong></li><li>Type <strong>Y</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong> on the next prompt.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Desktop freezes sometimes&#58; Can&#39;t click on icons, drag selection rectangles, or get right click menu.</h2>
                    
<p>I can see my desktop and icons just fine, and everything else on my computer works perfectly. But sometimes my desktop will freeze up and only restarting my computer seems to fix it. If I open up my desktop as a folder via the start menu, I can access everything
 fine there, I just can't do anything from my actual desktop. Also if I personalize my desktop via the Desktop folder, I can change the wallpaper on the actual desktop and it changes instantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far this seems to only happen right after talking in MSN Messenger, but it doesn't happen every time I talk in MSN so I'm not entirely sure if it's related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a pretty new computer so this shouldn't be happening. I also don't want to have to restart my computer every time this happens, it shouldn't be happening.</p>

<p>It's starting to look like it indeed was a dust build up. Because about an hour ago my computer kept shutting down on me(Which has happened once before), so after trying everything I could to figure out what was wrong I took out my duster(which I rarely
 if ever use) and cleaned out the dust from my tower, the computer seems to be working now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will probably be the last time I buy a Certified Data computer, I didn't have to dust my previous computers every few months like I do this one.</p>

<h2>            Stop Code 0x0000007e on Win 7 Pro 32-bit</h2>
                    Hey guys, I have a Dell Vostro 1510 that just started BSODing on me last Sunday (the 17th). Whenever Windows attempts to load (sometimes in Safe Mode as well, however Safe Mode works successfully much more often than not), I get the stop code 0x0000007e
 with parameters (0xC0000005, 0x90A0BA91, 0x807864E8, 0x807860C0). In my Device Manager, the only driver that's faulty is a Mass Storage Controller, which I think is for my flash drive. I've tried researching everywhere, but can't find any problems relating
 to Windows 7 Pro 32-bit yet.<br />
<br />
So far, I've rolled back the graphics driver, and after that didn't work, even tried uninstalling it. I eventually wound up formatting my hard drive entirely with a brand new installation of Windows 7 Pro, but I'm still receiving the same BSOD.<br />
<br />
I haven't changed any hardware, but since the BSODs started happening, I've reseated my 2 RAM modules. However, I've ran the MemTest86 Diagnostic Tool, which ran 9 times over the course of one night, and found no errors at all.<br />
<br />
If there's any more information needed, please just ask. I would love nothing more than to get my laptop up and running again.<br />

            Quite a few things to update:<br />
<br />
I've formatted my hard drive with a new installation of Windows 7 Pro as of this last Sunday. But since my DVD drive doesn't work, I removed my hard drive, installed it into my gf's Vostro 1520, then formatted there. The hard drive works perfectly while in
 her computer, but now while in mine, I get a BSOD with error 0x0000007B, again while whenever loading Windows (even in Safe Mode).<br />
<br />
I have no minidump files nor even a folder. I changed my settings as per the support page to create minidump logs, and have had at least three BSODs on the computer since, but no logs are being generated.<br />
<br />
My computer is a Dell Vostro 1510. <br />
<br />
I'll repost with BIOS information shortly.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

            <p>A kernel memory dump records only the kernel memory. This speeds up the process of recording information in a log when your computer stops unexpectedly. You must have a pagefile large enough to accommodate your kernel memory. For 32-bit systems, kernel memory
 is usually between150MB and 2GB. Additionally, on Windows 2003 and Windows XP, the page file must be on the boot volume. Otherwise, a memory dump cannot be created.<br />

<p>Most system failures result in a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) and a dumpfile report is created providing that the computer has been configured to create reports.<span>
</span>In a limited number of system failures no dumpfile is created. A report is generated when the computer is next booted and placed in the System Log in Event viewer. The report is given an Event ID number 6008 and gives very little helpful information,
 save that the cause is unknown and that it occurred at the date and time specified. . A further report is placed in the Reliability Monitor with a red orb on the Miscellaneous Failures line and it is recorded as a Critical Failure. Unfortunately the Technical
 Details for this type of failure reveal no additional information.</p>
<p>Are you able to create a system restore point and is it retyained after you restart the conputer?</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; One would think that would be the obvious fix but not.&nbsp; Display did not provide a way to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later in the day, I discovered my Windows 10 had been updated on 11/2.&nbsp; Finally found something on Youtube that sent me to the Control Panel which led me to the device manager.&nbsp; There I saw the AMD video drive had been updated.&nbsp; I remembered in my earlier
 sojourn through the system earlier in the day that I saw something that said there was no AMD device installed.&nbsp; So, went to the AMD info window where it allowed me to roll back to previous status prior to the update.&nbsp; FIXED IT!!!</p>

 yesterday and I am so frustrated that I can't restore them. &nbsp;The pictures were uploaded on 4-22-17 and I edited them on 5-6-17 at which time some were deleted. &nbsp;I also installed Recuva and scanned the computer but this folder wasn't found. &nbsp;Help!

<p>You can restore the previous version of just the folder where the files used to be and if that folder contains junk then the junk will be there too but that is about your only option:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is what I call a self inflicted wound (aka cockpit error).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the circumstances and environment Restore Previous Version may help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has a Restore Previous Version feature that you can investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Restore Previous Version (RPV) can only be use on drives/volumes that are being monitored by Windows and sometimes the only volume that is being monitored is the C drive where Windows is usually installed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this example RPV would only be available on folders on the C drive or C volume:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d0606068-395e-4615-a260-0d3f1056e654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f49e9f5f-df1f-4bd4-953d-78dd6bbce9ca" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to use RPV for folders on volumes D or E (which are not being monitored) you would see a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=06184fb4-fafc-4cd1-b4bd-17cb7cf39e65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f50e6a50-7069-4766-9195-4c878a3e943e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Right click the folder the files were in before the cut (or permanent delete) and choose Restore Previous Version:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/288875e8-d13f-4b33-a663-33de152209a9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>RPV keeps copies of your folders (even personal folders) and accumulates previous versions based on your System Restore and backup activity so there will be a previous version for every Restore Point (if the drive is being monitored) and every backup listed
 by date:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf148d1e-57fe-42e4-aece-73e0bce70082" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above example, the one marked Yesterday is when my system made a Restore Point at 1:09 AM and that matches up with the dates in my System Restore calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click Restore and respond in the affirmative:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f8c6ce0-a45a-43d3-8e80-ea2ab299efe1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what RPV has to do and how big the folder is in content, it could take some time since the entire folder will be restored and not just some file(s):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba644b0c-bef1-40e2-ad84-a0b66e2f26cc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all goes well you should see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d92ca45-00d9-41bc-bad8-9497a0a188bc" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>If anyone cares to see if it really works use a folder with a few files in it and make sure when you right click a folder that there are Previous Versions listed, then delete&nbsp; a file in that folder and restore it to an earlier date/time.</p>

<h2>            Buying Microsoft Word without purchasing Office</h2>
                    <p>I recently accidentally uninstalled&nbsp;Microsoft Word from my computer. Is there a way that I can purchase Word without buying the entire Office package? OpenOffice will not work for me, I need to be able to construct and edit documents.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>OpenOffice (and LibreOffice) does allow you to construct and edit documents that are compatible with Microsoft Office documents, but if you want to purchase Word you certainly can do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of considerations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, Microsoft usually prices things so that buying only one of the components of Office is often hardly less expensive than buying the entire suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, you may or may not be able to purchase an older version of Office.&nbsp; Microsoft is currently pushing its "software as a service" and would like to have you use Office 365, which is a subscription product.&nbsp; You can, however, still buy the current edition
 of Office (or Word) as a stand-alone, install it once and you own it, product.&nbsp; You can also use "Office online" which is actually free.&nbsp; Here's a comparison of the 3 ways to get the current version of Office:&nbsp;

https://www.cnet.com/how-to/ways-to-get-office-2016/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 (the stand-alone one-time purchase product) is currently $149 (direct from Microsoft) for Office Home &amp; Student 2016, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.&nbsp;

    <title>Halo 4 not to be picked up by MLG because microsoft wont play ball, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oh ver driive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 4 not to be picked up by MLG because microsoft wont play ball, but 343i will&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>For everyone who doesn't know what MLG is. It stands for Major League Gaming. It is the pinnacle of Halo's competitive world and since halo 3 has taken a downward tumble both for the social and hardcore communities. For social players, they have gained a
 larger and larger sandbox for multiplayer, some cool new features, and an epic new story. For the more hardcore however, we were left hanging dry with hopes of solid mechanics in a world we understand better than some of the creators themselves. Halo, now
 being on life support has only recently had an MLG member join 343i who is supposed to be holding the reigns for the big TU we are suppose to have coming. This, raised a lot of hopes. The social community while some realize and some don't have been given poorly
 made mechanics created by a team who was trying to cater to masses and recreate the halo experience. While they got close, its finishing touches were never added, its maps were poorly designed and several few key halo elements had been left out. The game itself,
 has an incredible amount of auto aim, to slow down the reticle when its over an opponent. Bullet magnetism, self explained but basically as long as your pretty close, you will get credit, taking away the skill of who can aim better. With a decent TU the game
 has real potential, i enjoy playing it and enjoy the new sandbox (everything thats in the game that we use)
<br />
<br />
With that said, MLG events for halo have been on a steady decline. Games like call of duty that reward more selfish play styles and are easier to be successful at seem to cornering the market and may be the future for MLG. Call of duty itself, will reward a
 player who sits back and makes sure not to die so solidify his kill streaks instead of a player who pushes against the other team. If everyone played that way, games would be very boring, so, instead of hiding, sprinting with a single shot kill weapon that
 has crazy distances can also be a successful way to play. Neither ways encourage teamwork. The companies willing to work with MLG however doesnt seem to have Microsoft on the list.
<br />
<br />
Which is why I'm here.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt anyone of value will see this, I know its better posted here, than on the MLGpro.com website as its already being talked about enough there. Microsoft I hope can have a real conversation with Sundance DiGiovanni to come to an agreement as to
 what type of sponsoring and involvement each will have with the other from now, and into the future. The company itself has nothing to lose, as the game is already in circulation, has a huge fan base, wants to see a good TU, and has been the corner stone for
 the original xbox based on sales. The history is there, a good title update is on the way for a game that potentially has extremely solid mechanics provided the right settings are adjusted, play lists and maps are added, and the tu fixes the core problems.
 I have high hopes that halo can become the game it was during halo 1, 2 and 3's days. Making the game require more skill to play will encourage people to play more and spend the time learning it just like we used to do. Halo 4 tried a "pick it up and go" approach
 that let anyone pick up the controller and instantly be a decent player. Something that in the past just didnt happen, now, call of duty does that but in the extreme. If your trying to compete with what is easier to be good at, cod is going to win every time.
 Halo has potential but microsoft needs to support 343i's decision to work with us. Otherwise halo is going to turn into a game that gets released and vanishes because the public played the story and than traded it in. Another game with little replay value
 and a crumbling multiplayer. I say take halos multiplayer back to its roots and just add the new sandbox and the new metagame with a good TU. Of course having things like visible ranks that go up and down are a good thing. Your "rank" consistently going up
 is not a "rank" its called leveling. Its a grind mechanic that we saw in early RPG's and MMO's. It has no place in a competitive game with a winner and a loser. Have a social play list like we use to with no ranks. 80% of players still played the ranked play
 lists where you would be punished for losing. <br />
<br />
MICROSOFT SAVE HALO AND WORK WITH MLG I PROMISE THERES A FUTURE IN IT <br />
<br />
the halo community is like questioning life wondering what reasons microsoft could possibly have to not want to work wit hMLG and put halo back on the map. Both in the social players world and the competitive players world. Letting call of duty just wipe the
 market and take over competitive first person shooters is stupid. Thats what the next 10 years or so will be like without microsoft and mlg working together. A future many of us just dont want to see. FPS on pc i garuntee will rise. The new counter strike
 could even becomem ore popular competitively than the current call of duty series even if mlg did work with cod to make the game.

<p>Never really understood the whole MLG thing. &nbsp;Video gaming is a way to escape reality. &nbsp;Anyone with an ounce of intelligence and a basic reasoning to adapt to situations can be good at gaming.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Not dogging your post, I feel your pain. &nbsp;I just feel that people like those from MLG are what is ruining gaming. &nbsp;It used to be about fun and enjoying the game, now it's all about who can press a button the fastest. &nbsp;No real skill is required for gaming.
 &nbsp;Just a thought process and when to point and click. &nbsp;Why do you think CoD is doing so well even though it's the same basic game each and every year?</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I know this post will be viewed with hatred and I might offend some people but it's reality and it's my opinion. &nbsp;When people can realize that gaming is just that, gaming, then these game makers will actually take more chances and try something new rather
 than the same, boring, redone, rehashed games we see today.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Good post, I didn't mind that it was lengthy and it was a very logical rant. &nbsp;I feel your frustration and understand that your way of gaming is being threatened. &nbsp;I hope things get better for you in the future ^.^</p>

<p>thats kinda done, i think those days are over. You see a lot of those types of players on call of duty now but your avid mlg'ers dont have that mentality. Most, including myself are more interested in seeing the community rise. Meaning, you would sooner
 get an invite to teach you before i criticized you based on halo skills. </p>

<p>Gaming has a competitive side, golf is as simple as swinging a club and like any sport or competitive game the more you do it the better you will get. In the same way an NFL players body is adapted for the game a pro players mind is adapted. Do you think
 the same nfl player can sit infront of a screen for as long as many of us do and perform as well as pro players just as easily as a Tom Taylor could replace Tom Brady? Games are a way to escape reality yes but why limit them when they have other potential?

 be a part of their next game. Halo 4 has the MLG symbol on the cover but offered us little to no insight on what they were doing and didnt involve us at all in the making of the multiplayer. Microsoft built 343i from the ground up with the idea of halo in
 mind. To not involve from the start and barely involve us for a big TU kinda makes me wonder why the mlg icon is on the cover at all. Competitve gaming will always have its place and i persnally enjoy SC just as much as i enjoy halo. I just have been with
 halo longer and enjoy the team aspect of it far more than the 1v1 aspect of SC. </p>
<p>With that said, ive played wow, ffxiv, gw2, and ffxi and ffxi i spent years playing. I'm a fan of games in general and understand completely what you mean when you say they are an escape from reality. I will be the first to say i halo 4's story i curled
 up in a chair and played on a giant tv just to do it, Something i do with any game im not competitively into. Gears, dead space, spiderman shattered dimenions and edge of time, dark siders, metal gear, looking forward to new one and new devil may cry. So I'm
 definitely a fan of both but in the way poker, paintball, and w/e other sports you know many people just dont consider to be sports, horse dancing for me is dumb as *** but its in the Olympics. Competitive gaming has its place in the world. Gaming is an art
 and therefore freedom of speech but that doesnt mean the mechanics inside those worlds cant spark the same competitiveness you see in a hardcore game of chess. 3D chess, is insane and rarely if ever can you find people who know how to play. I dont, but watched
 friends play. Its all choices you make inside your head,. </p>

<p>Gaming has a competitive side, golf is as simple as swinging a club and like any sport or competitive game the more you do it the better you will get. In the same way an NFL players body is adapted for the game a pro players mind is adapted. Do you think
 the same nfl player can sit infront of a screen for as long as many of us do and perform as well as pro players just as easily as a Tom Taylor could replace Tom Brady? Games are a way to escape reality yes but why limit them when they have other potential?

<p>Why should they consult you on the multi-player?<br />
<br />
Forgive me from saying so but the prevailing attitude from MLG seems to be "we want the multi-player to be good and by good we mean tailored to the way we want to play. "<br />
<br />
Is it not possible instead for you to adapt to how Microsoft or 343i want the multi-player to be? Can't you take to a new playing field as it were?&nbsp;</p>

<p>VoteDC you misunderstand. Not sure who kinda gave you that idea and I by no means think anyone SHOULD consult me personally. What they should do is consult players who have been around for years. Even at 15$ an hour your getting paid 1 billionth of anyone
 at 343i and more than your average retail worker. Why not put their skills and experiences to paper?
</p>
<p>MLG balances games in worlds without balance. So with halo 4 for example. We have a giant new sandbox filled with toys to play with. Many people started in right away with an "anti-vanilla" way of looking at halo 4 for MLG. Many players were just not interested
 in breaking the game down and trying to turn it into halo 1 or 2. The goal, should be light touches to the meta game itself. So where in regular play lists where players can choose to spawn with w/e MLG will take those same weapons and AA's and put them in
 the game to encourage skill, map movement and teamwork. Instead of spawning with a jetpack, it has to be picked up. In every game, there will always be a dominant set up or strategy and MLG takes those strategies and set ups and breaks them down so that they
 are balanced across the board for each team. Another example would be the halo 4 BR and DMR being in the same game.

<p>The DMR has a faster rate of fire, a faster kill time, and a longer range. Making it the better rifle of the four we have available. The BR, has a slower kill time, and a slightly larger reticule so at closer ranges it can be easier to aim since with the
 smaller reticule the dmr has it requires more minor adjustments when firing. We break the game down to its core mechanics because it really is just a game of math. We do it for ourselves and one day for the social community as well. Why should players unknowingly
 be shorting themselves by picking a gun that doesnt kill as effectively as another when they are all available as starting weapons? Don't you ever lose a battle you wish you won? Well what if I told you you lost because the way the game was balanced, not because
 your a bad player? Thats where we come in. We do it for you, we do it for us, you would have more fun winning based on your skill. We would have more fun knowing the settings are balanced. Win win.</p>

    <title>What Windows 10 app opens .BIN files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> audis4  say:</h3>
<h2>            What Windows 10 app opens .BIN files</h2>
                    <p>I cannot install almost all Windows updates since 12/17/17 Fall Creator update. I've uninstalled, downloaded again, deleted the Download folder and downloaded again to no avail. Tonight I noticed the .BIN extension is associated to VLC video viewer and there
 is one .BIN file in the Download folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What is the Windows 10 default program to execute .BIN files? I removed the VLC association in the registry but do not what to reset it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once this is done I'm hoping the updates may actually start installing correctly. I would like to get this Fall Creator problem fixed before the Spring update downloads and perhaps makes things worse.</p>

<p>Hi AudiS4,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.BIN files are most commonly associated with compressed binary files, there are instances that these files are saved in basic binary format and can be opened with a text editor. To isolate the issue with your Windows 10 updates, please provide the following
 information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you receiving any error messages when trying to update your PC?</li><li>If yes, please send us a screenshot.</li><li>Also, can you download other files such as videos, or images without any issues?</li></ul>

<p>Is there a way to force the xbox to search for game updates besides having "instant on" enabled, which doesn't work many times? (Besides I like to turn the console completly off).</p>
<p>It's so annoying when you haven't played a game for a while and get slapped with an 8 gig update, there really should be a way to search for updates besides starting up each game :(.</p>
<p>If there is, please let me now :), if not, MS please implement this as this would be a very usefull function.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail app crashing after not saving emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail app crashing after not saving emails</h2>
                    So just this week I have noticed that emails that I save from the W10 Mail app will save as a 0 KB file. Then after "saving," the app crashes and has to be reopened. The files will open as blank emails.

            Hi Marianne.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What works most is to go to Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Mail app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and see if the issue is resolved now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank heavens someone has reported this this. <span>I am having exactly the same problem, which started happening just today.
</span>I have wasted hours trying to resolve, with all the obvious things, like Reset the App, re-boot etc, none of these make any difference.&nbsp; I am reluctant to Uninstall and re-install, in case I lose email contacts and setup etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I notice that there was a Windows update on 30 August, so I tried System Restore, even with Ant-virus turned off, as suggested, but if fails with an error message, about a file that fails to restore. This happens on all available restore points that I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure Microsoft have changed something on that update.</p>

            The problem -- Mail crashing when saving emails -- started 2 versions ago of the Mail app. It started with one update, and continued with the next, 16005.10730.20064.0 . It's broken across multiple devices, meaning it's Most Probably a problem with the
 app itself, rather than something to do with an individual win10 install. One example: I hadn't fired up my tablet for several days, so I successfully saved an earlier email using win10's Mail. The Mail app then updated to the version listed, and trying to
 save the same email resulted in failure with the Mail app crashing. Hopefully there will be another update to Mail soon, and just as hopefully that fixes the problem -- there were 2 or 3 days between the last 2 versions, but we had the holiday weekend which
 I assume will delay things a bit. <br />

<p>I've had the same problem on my PC and my Laptop with the exception of my Hotmail Account within the Mail app.</p>

<p>For what it's worth...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated a copy of win10 on this PC to the latest Slow Ring Insider build, 17744, and the Mail app was the same version crashing on regular [non-Insider] copies of 10. Updated a VM [Virtual Machine] to the current Insider Fast Ring build, getting Mail version
 16005.10730.20084.0, which is new. It works properly, saving emails the way it used to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, take that for what it's worth... </p>
<p>I don't expect everyone to jump to the latest Fast ring build. It might mean that Microsoft has a handle on the problem, or maybe the Fast Ring version never shared the latest regression in Mail's code, or maybe they intend on keeping this feature rather
 than killing it off? </p>
<p>
Personally I expected a fix by now. I'll probably go back to Live Mail [yes, it still works in win10] if it's not fixed by the weekend. The next version of win10 is due out this month from what I've read, with general release next month. I figure I can put
 up with the more insecure Live Mail for a couple of weeks if I have to -- the potential risk is less than the definite pain of not being able to save emails.</p>

<p>Hi Juan</p>
<p>I tried all those, but no success.</p>
<p>However i tried something else today, i logged on using a VPN and it opened. It seems that the middle east (UAE and Oman) block it. It worked before when password was in, but trying from a new device blocked it.</p>
