<h2>            Microsoft DFS Folder Access Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am migrating DFS name space from Windows 2003 to Windows 2016 in Stand alone DFS with Cluster Environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing issue that after creating DFS name space role in windows 2016 that Folder -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Folder access through \\DFSNameSpace\Shared Folder\DFS links or
 Shares</span></p>
<p>I am expecting that DFS Name space can be accessed like&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\\DFSNameSpace\DFS
 links or Shares. This way I am able to access in windows 2003.</span></p>

    <title>USB Webcam showing as Hidden in Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Webcam showing as Hidden in Device Manager</h2>
                    I have a USB Camera attached to my PC which is running Windows 10. When it was first connected everything seemed to be working as expected. When I last tried to use it with the Camera App that comes with Windows 10 I got an error message that tells me
 it can't find the camera. I opened Device Manager and the USB Camera does not appear under Imaging Devices until I select "Show hidden Devices". I've tried Updated the Driver bur the system tells me I have the latest Driver. I've read various forums and tried
 various "Fixes" without any results. The antivirus software I have is Windows Defender and I can't find anywhere to unblock the camera (if this is what is happening). If anyone has had this issue have they managed to get their camera working again?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the response. No hardware changes were made prior to this issue being experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>Tried method 1 as you described. Received a message which says – “Install a driver for this device. The driver for Unknown device is not installed. Install the latest driver for
 the device”. I selected “Apply this fix”. PC then had to be restarted to finish installing drivers and updates so I closed the dialogue box and restarted the PC. Once the restart was complete I did a couple of checks:-</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Opened the Camera App – still receive the “We can’t find your camera” message. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Opened Device Manager – USB Camera still does not appear under Imaging Devices even when “Show Hidden devices” is selected.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Then opened the Windows Apps Troubleshooter which said that it couldn’t identify any problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m not certain what you mean by “Write to us with the status of webcam drivers hidden in Device manager and not able to detect the same device using Camera app on the computer for
 further assistance”. As mentioned above the Webcam is still not listed in Device manager and the Camera App still can’t find it.</span></p>
<p><span>Should I return to a previous restore point to a t least get the device listed in Device Manager even if it is in a hidden state?</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the response. When I started the PC this morning (with the webcam connected to the USB port) I did a few checks before anything else. Webcam still not being recognised
 by the Camera app. Webcam still not being listed in Device Manager (hidden or otherwise). Power is going to the Webcam as the lights on Webcam still operational. The microphone (integrated into Webcam) is operational as Cortana responds.</span></p>
<p><span>I then started a System Restore. The oldest restore point I was offered was 28/6/16 (Last critical update installed). Upon PC reboot I received a message saying that “System Restore
 was successful”.</span></p>
<p><span>Current state is that “USB2.0 Camera” is again listed in Device Manager under Imaging Devices but only when “Show Hidden Devices” is selected. I right clicked on the device and tried
 to Update Driver software but received a message to say that the “best driver software for your device is installed” which is the “USB Video Device” driver. Camera App still doesn’t recognise that&nbsp;a Webcam is attached.</span></p>
<p><span>Are there any tips or tricks that I can apply that will enable me to have the “USB2.0 Camera” device in a permanently visible state rather than hidden? Have you had any app or malware
 reported that hijacks the camera and makes it hidden to the system?</span></p>
<span>Any further advice would be appreciated.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in my original post "The antivirus software I have is Windows Defender and I can't find anywhere to unblock the camera (if this is what is happening)." If you happen to know where I can go to see what (if anything) the Defender software is blocking
 please tell me and I'll check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the <strong>Viewing Hidden Devices</strong> article and I think this is basically telling me what I've been doing all the time to see the USB camera in device manager. However Viewing the device in the list isn't allowing the Webcam to be "seen" by
 the Camera App. I need to be able to mark the device as visible or accessible to the system and I'm not certain any instruction you've given tells me how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your continued help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Firstly apologies for not getting back sooner but I've been on holiday for a couple of weeks and didn't have access to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to check whether the webcam is blocked or not by following your instructions. I've followed Step 1 and 2 OK as requested. Your step 3 implies to me that I should now see a list of blocked apps in a box. However when I click on
<strong>Allow an app through Windows Firewall </strong>what I get is a list of the allowed Apps and Features rather than a list of Blocked Apps. I cannot see webcam or anything similar in the list of allowed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I follow your steps correctly. Am I missing something here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Webcam is still classed as hidden in Device manage and the Camera App still cannot see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

                    <div>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daily, several times a day, BSOD's with "KERNEL MODE HEAP CORRUPTION". I can still use my PC tho. It can still boot up and run apps. I never installed any unknown software. Regularly, the Minidump folder is empty after a BSOD, so I created a Reserve folder
 to save as many MDP-files as I can.</p>
<br />
<p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DWoUOosQOH8dSQaIAy_msZX60gReLjJt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if this'll work, hope so...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Yes the minidump indicates Malwarebytes and Bullguard were competing for resources.
<br />
<br />I would advise you to also fully uninstall Bullguard as well, Just use Windows Defender which has proven to provide both exceptional detection and compatibility.
<br />
<br />I am glad to have helped. If you don't have any more questions, feel free to choose a rating and have a great day!

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there's no way to implement that if he's actually using this account that you're typing from to purchase items. You'd have to essentially contact phone support and have them remove the card on file to prevent purchases.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to purchase items you would have to purchase currency cards that are available digitally online or physically in stores where gaming products are sold (Best Buy, Gamestop, Walmart, Target etc).</p>
<p>You should be able to reach out to phone support by visiting this page <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>

    <title>unable to unpin item from file explorer&#47;quick access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to unpin item from file explorer&#47;quick access</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, my user folder is not allowing me to be unpinned from the file explorer menu nor quick access. I click on unpin, nothing happens whatsoever. If I simply right-click on the folder I am prompted with a message, "The item you selected is
 unavailable. It might have been moved, renamed, or removed. Do you want to remove it from the list?" So, I of course select delete, and again NOTHING HAPPENS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little background... The folder in question is my user folder that I had moved to mapped network drive. Well, I reconfigured my server, changing the name in the process, but this folder is still pointing to my old server name. I can not for the life of
 me figure out why such a simple process is becoming a nightmare to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to move all my other folders (documents, pictures, music, etc) without a single bit of trouble.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying with the answers to the above questions.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply, did you try if you are able to login into the user account on booting the computer in
<strong>Safe mode</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the
<strong>User Profile Service</strong> <strong>(ProfSvc) </strong>not enabled/started in the user profile.
<strong>User profile service (ProfSvc)</strong> is a service responsible for loading and unloading the user profile. If
<strong>ProfSvc</strong> is stopped or disabled, user will not be able to login into the user profile.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If haven’t tried, check if you are able to login into the user account on booting the computer in
<strong>Safe mode</strong>. If the issue persists, set up another user account on the computer by referring to
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Set up accounts</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;article
 and check if similar issue persists. This is only to check if the issue is specific to user profile or the OS installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>

<p>2. Tried repair the Registry by booting into safe mode, Navigating to regedit, then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then Software, then Microsoft, then WindowsNT, then Current Version, then ProfileList. &nbsp;I have 4 entries (S-1-5-21-3618229942-1389237785-2037264756-1001,
 1002, 1003, 1005) that all seem to map to one of the 4 User profiles that are working. &nbsp;There are three entries that appear to map to a Windows Service (S-1-5-18 is mapped to System32\config\systemprofile, S-1-5-19 is mapped to ServiceProfiles\LocalService,
 and S-1-5-20 is mapped to ServiceProfiles\NetworkService) but those are the only SID's I can find in the list. &nbsp;I expected to see 3 other profiles for the other 2 users that cannot log in as well as the Guest account, but those do not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help to resolve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if the information helps, but I did not upgrade to Windows 10 from another OS, I purchased a new machine&nbsp;that had Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>

    <title>Kinect Forum&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanmcclain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect Forum&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Where is the Kinect forum?&nbsp; I know that it seems to be the in thing to trash the Kinect &amp; freak out about it, but I can't possibly be the only person that not only loves the current Kinect, but only owns an Xbox because of it.&nbsp; There has to be a small community
 of like-minded users out there.&nbsp; I just went online searching for more info on the next generation Kinect for Xbox One &amp; haven't been able to find much of anything new from E3.&nbsp; I realize that Microsoft is really downplaying the Kinect due to all of the backlash
 it received from the first generation.&nbsp; I'm guessing the thought is that they'll just include it, people will get used to it, they'll eventually appreciate the power of it &amp; grow to love it.&nbsp; Yep, that's a good idea, but there are some of us that want more.&nbsp;
 For instance, accept the fact that there are some of us that are more Kinect fans than Xbox fans.&nbsp; We don't want to sit on the sofa pushing buttons.&nbsp; We want to get off our *** &amp; move around.&nbsp; It's clear that this next generation is far more advanced.&nbsp; Well,
 get some videos on xbox.com that we may share on social media, to feed the hype.&nbsp; What do you have besides Kinect Sports Rivals in the pipeline for Kinect?&nbsp; I have seasons one &amp; two &amp; love them both.&nbsp; Never had much of a problem with the current Kinect tracking
 me &amp; love the additional features of the next generation.&nbsp; I think anyone that's played Dance Central, especially Dance Central 3 has seen how the Kinect completely changes the Xbox experience.&nbsp; I'm hoping for another Kinect Adventures, because that game was
 one heck of an experience.&nbsp; Star Wars for Kinect was amazing as well.&nbsp; There is no other Kinect game that has caused me to sweat so much &amp; walk out of view, so that I could bring the heart rate down.&nbsp; Like I said, I've never had much of an issue with the Kinect
 &amp; I purchased the Xbox with Kinect intending for it to be the most entertaining exercise device I've ever purchased.&nbsp; What other exercise "games" are in the pipeline that you can talk about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, think about allowing us to pin "Kinect Central" on the Xbox.&nbsp; I haven't been able to figure out how to pin it &amp; whenever I go into the Games section it's not clear where I'll find it.&nbsp; How about at least labeling it?&nbsp; There are those of us that embrace
 the Kinect.&nbsp; How about embracing us back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, there is a better way to help us to find other good games.&nbsp; If you were to use my player history you could see that I have played the most of X, Y &amp; Z games.&nbsp; Now I'm not talking completed, I'm talking about actual play time.&nbsp; If you were to compare
 all of the players in your database you could see that others that have played X, Y &amp; Z also played A, B &amp; C often, then you could recommend to me more legitimate suggestions.&nbsp; We're sick of lame suggestions.&nbsp; Get smart with the suggestions &amp; that will help
 users to find games that they are ACTUALLY more likely to enjoy, which creates an even stronger fan base for you.&nbsp; You're doing great, but that doesn't mean you can't do even better.&nbsp; Also, the rating system is really REALLY lame.&nbsp; Nearly every game gets 4-5
 stars.&nbsp; Stop fooling yourselves, because you're not fooling us.&nbsp; Remove the manual ratings.&nbsp; If you play it you like it, therefore you are able to create a system that automatically rates a game based on play time.&nbsp; A more real rating system will draw us in
 much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...also, have a Coming Soon section that's always on the main screen.&nbsp; This could break down those items, by category, that are coming within the next week, month, quarter, year or whatever.&nbsp; This is your means to get us looking at what's coming.&nbsp; Now I'm
 not talking about those things that people pay to put into a highlighted section, I'm talking about EVERYTHING coming.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to go to bestbuy.com to see what games are coming.&nbsp; I should be able to log into my Xbox &amp; see, "Oh, in a couple of months
 X is coming out."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create homes for us Kinect lovers out there, because we're there.&nbsp; There's already too many haters out there.&nbsp; Because people don't optimize lighting, placement &amp; movement for their Kinect &amp; then whine about the device doesn't mean their views are valid.&nbsp;
 I know that the only&nbsp;fix&nbsp;someone determined to complain is to simply let them get bored of complaining, but if you create a space for people to see how much more the Kinect has to offer you'll have somewhere for those who do not yet know to go &amp; see what the
 Kinect can do.&nbsp; Fitness Evolved 2012 &amp; Nike Fit are two titles that were pretty darn awesome.&nbsp; I loved Biggest Loser as well.&nbsp; There are some of us old fat men that would like to prevent heart attack &amp; stroke by jumping around, looking like fools, without
 being seen by those young fit healthy people that we used to be.&nbsp; :-D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh &amp; where's that Kinect forum?</p>

</p><p>If you're on Skype for Windows 10 version 12.xx, it's not possible to copy multiple messages. You can only copy a chat from one chat bubble&nbsp;at a time.

    <title>Ajuda com jogo travando o Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrsolaris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ajuda com jogo travando o Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Fala galera! Estou postando um problema aqui na esperança de conseguir um help de alguém que já tenha tido este tipo de problema com este ou outro jogo qualquer.</p>
<p>Comprei o Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth Kinect na marketplace já a algum tempo e quando foi comprado ele funcionou normal sem nenhum problema. Fiquei um bom tempo sem jogá-lo e esses dias quando fui tentar jogá-lo novamente ele trava/congela todo o Xbox
 após alguns segundos iniciados, ainda no menu principal do jogo. Só enfiando o dedão na console para desligar.</p>
<p>Alguns testes que já fiz e não resolveu:</p>
<p>- Apaguei o jogo e a DLC de personagens e baixei tudo de novo.<br />
- Apaguei o cache do sistema.<br />
- Ele estava armazenado no HD interno do Xbox. Baixei para um HD externo USB.<br />
- Entrei no jogo com outro perfil que tenho no Xbox, só que perfil não Gold.<br />
- Nenhum outro jogo instalado (mais de 60) apresenta este problema.<br />
- Nenhum outro jogo do Kinect apresenta este problema. Kinect funciona normal.<br />
- Este foi o último jogo que comprei no marketplace, depois dele só os Games with Gold.<br />
- Minha conta é BR e semprei foi. Nunca foi migrada.<br />
<br />
Rapaziada, qualquer idéia ou sugestão é bem vinda. Ainda não cheguei a entrar em contato com o suporte técnico porque, de repente pode ser algo simples de resolver e que eu não tenho conhecimento. Se alguém já tiver passado por isso, mesmo que com outro jogo,
 por favor me dê uma luz.</p>
<p>Valeu!</p>

<p>Fala galera! Realizei mais uns testes aqui e percebi que com os dois perfis que eu já tinha no console e que eu já tinha utilizado para jogar esse jogo travam tudo quando eu seleciono o dispositivo de armazenamento. Travam tudo até o controle, só consigo
 desligar apertando o botão do Xbox. Eu baixei um terceiro perfil, um que nunca tinha sido usado neste jogo, e com esse perfil funciona normalmente. O mais estranho é que se eu entrar no jogo com este terceiro perfil live e dentro do jogo mudar para qualquer
 um dos dois que estão dando problema eles funcionam normalmente sem travar.</p>
<p>Por favor, quem tiver alguma ideia dá um help aí. Estou começando a ficar preocupando em forçar o desligamento do Xbox pelo botão do console toda vez que realizo algum teste e trava. Estou com medo de que esse desligamento brusco toda hora possa danificar
 o sistema do console, se isso for possível.</p>

 mentioned on the internet, including pressing on Fn+F2 but it didn't work. Now, I am not sure if I have Bluetooth or not. The only trace of it that I can find on the laptop is in the device manager section where it is called BlueSoleil Generic Bluetooth Driver
 but there is nothing on the notification tray or in the programs sections in the control panel. I don't know what to do and I need Bluetooth as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suspect that Windows 7 Ultimate didn't come with your Dell Inspiron and that you installed it yourself (I'm not sure why you did, considering that you only have 4 GB of RAM, but that's beside the point; if you got it because you want to use BitLocker Drive
 Encryption, be extremely sure that you know and follow best practices for using this dangerous feature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you installed Ultimate by doing a clean install, you may not have installed all of the drivers or may not have installed all of the drivers in the correct order.&nbsp; My understanding is that the Dell "QuickSet" driver is what provides the Fkey functionality.</p>

            True, it didn't come with my laptop but a month ago my hard drive failed and I had to go to someone who can change it for me. He changed the windows too and I didn't know about that until he gave me the laptop back.&nbsp;<br />
Is that dangerous? Will it badly affect my laptop?&nbsp;<br />
When I went to the link of the drivers section there were many drivers that had bluetooth and wireless or Wifi in it. I don't know which one is the right one. Do I download the Dell Quickset driver?&nbsp;<br />

<p>If the person who fixed your laptop charged you for the service, you should go back to him and ask him to install all of the drivers necessary to get Windows working properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, you may well want to ask him either to reinstall the same edition of Windows 7 that you originally had (e.g., Home Premium or Professional), or provide you with a new Certificate of Authenticity for Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; I've seen many people in
 a situation similar to yours post here wondering why -- from several months to several years after their computer was "upgraded" --&nbsp; they were experiencing popup messages reporting that their installation of Windows was "not authentic" any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable or unwilling to get help from this person, you need to either use the "Detect Drivers" button (if you select "Guide me") or enter your Dell Service Tag (if you select "Find it myself") when you go to the Dell support site.&nbsp; The Service Tag
 is supposed to enable Dell to determine exactly what hardware is installed in your particular computer and then offer you the specific drivers that you need.&nbsp; If you can't find your service tag on your computer (e.g., the label has worn off), use the "Detect
 Product" button.</p>

<h3> mikecissell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Verify Product Key for Windows 7 ISO</h2>
                    My product key won't verify when I try to obtain the Windows 7 ISO. I know the product key to be correct and 100% legitimate. I've put the key in manually and copy-pasted, but each time I am presented with an error message:<br />
<br />
"Refer to Message Code 715-123130 and Transaction ID 384df9c7-fcf8-4b67-9a5b-d4931ded6f4a."<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.

<h2>            Windows &#8220;System performance&#8221;, how do I know which programs one is not needed or not</h2>
                    I have noticed that my computer has been running slower lately. So I did a performance check and it said that I have too many programs running. I already know how to disable unwanted programs. My question is how do I know which one is not needed or not.
 I already tried searching some of them but my results only&nbsp;eliminated two of the 10 or so I have.&nbsp;
