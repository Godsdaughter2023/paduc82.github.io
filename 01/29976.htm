<h2>            Rocket League purchasing issues.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased Rocket League from my Xbox One in the store and when I purchased it, it said the transaction was successful. I then proceeded to My Games And Apps to check out the download and it weren't there. I went to my Ready To Install list and
 the game weren't there either. The transaction didn't show on my recent game transactions so I came here to resolve this problem. Please can I have my game or have my £15.99 refunded into my Microsoft account so I can attempt to re-doenload the game. Thank
 you.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Does the issue only happen to pdf attachments or all type of attachments?</font></span></p>
</li><li><span>Determine the exact build and version of your Windows Live Mail. To check this, follow these steps:<br />
1. On your keyboard hold <font><b>Windows</b> key and press </font><font><b>R.<br />
</b>2. In the textbox type, <b>appwiz.cpl</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.<br />

<h2>            Couldn&#39;t Update to Windows 8.1 0xC1900101 - 0x20007</h2>
                    <p>I purchased and have been running Windows 8 on my MacBook Pro Retina since release.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 8.1 Preview several months ago with no issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now that the release version is here I am unable to install Windows 8.1 release.&nbsp; After downloading and rebooting, it does the "Setting up" and counts to 76%.&nbsp; It sits at 76% for quite some time, then reboots and restores my previous operating system (Windows
 8.1 Preview).&nbsp; It finishes by saying "Couldn't update to Windows 8.1"&nbsp; 0xC1900101 - 0x20007</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried multiple times with the same results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have nothing connected to the laptop, it's just the built in hardware.</p>

                    I have dell m4600+windows7 professional.&nbsp; is there any way to get back&nbsp; option "Duplicate these displays " in drop down menu in screen resolution preferences? this computer was once updated to win 10 and returned back to win 7. Can this be a reason for
 missing an option? I can duplicate screen with nvidia control panel. But pressing win+P&gt;dublicate do not work either. In intel control panel (intel hd graphics 3000) thre is also only option "1 screen ". Have tried update driwers, changed resolution back to
 normal...

            and i'm using hdmi. i have deleted HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\TMM. I found that that my computer screen is using intel (quadro 2000M) and tv is using nvidia ( HD Graphics 3000) display adapter. Somewhere they said maybe this is the cause...
 I was plannig to try with hdmi-vga adabter if then i would be able to see "duplicate these displays", but i dont want to buy that now. Screen resolution settings does detect two monitors and there is no error messages. Is there a way to modify registry to
 get that option back? In old win 7 computer windows+P dublicate was working but i can not check it anymore how there was those settings. Anyone could check is tv and laptop in same display adabter when using hdmi and windows+P is working?

            answering to my self, but hopely someone can benefit this also. I'm trying now
<span>Intel GMA HD Graphics 2000/3000 Driver (</span><span>VIDEO_DRVR_WIN_R301733.EXE):
</span>Intel(R) HD Graphics Family 8.15.10.2353. Now when pressing win+P dublicate button works, but it still shows it only in laptop. In screen resolution now i have option to dublicate (after win+P) but it does not dublicate it in tv but to laptop showing
 1/2 is laptop+vga and screen no.3 is TV. And the dublicate option will disappear after returning back to laptop screen only. So in my case i think i can not have the duplicate option back without using vga connection. Propably need to try that also somethimes.
 But at least the duplicate option is there somewhere... So probably it will react the same way with newer adapters, but that also need to test when i can have vga connection.<br />

    <title>What does bootcfg look for to identify the XP installation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> servolock  say:</h3>
<h2>            What does bootcfg look for to identify the XP installation&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I boot the XP CD, choose Repair, it finds the Windows installation and I give it the password and get the command prompt.&nbsp; Then,&nbsp; bootcfg can't find the windows installation, even though the Recovery Console just did.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Likewise, I can't run a "repair install" because setup can't find an installation to repair.&nbsp; What are they looking for????&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This system won't boot, of course.&nbsp; I can't run SFC on this drive by attaching it as secondary in a functional XP system, because XP's version of SFC won't let me run it on a secondary drive (like Vista's SFC will.)
<br />
<br />
This is a corrupted installation and I'm prepared to replace corrupted system files manually if I know what to replace.&nbsp; I've searched the web for hours and can't find out what bootcfg wants to see. I've already replaced ntoskrnl and hal.&nbsp; Bootcfg apparently
 wants more.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Also, if I attach the drive as secondary on a functioning XP system I can run chkdsk on the problem drive and it finds no errors.&nbsp; But if I run the
<u><i>other</i></u> chkdsk, at the Recovery Console's command prompt, it finds corruption but doesn't tell me specifically what it found.<br />
<br />
Please help.

            Sadly, the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
After booting on the CD and pressing R and you get to a command prompt, does it read:<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS&gt;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
C:&gt;\<br />
<br />
If the latter (C:&gt;\) then it sounds like your system of unspecified make and model has SATA drives and the XP installation CD does not natively understand that unless you give it a little help.<br />
<br />
Remember that we can't see what you are seeing so be sure to tell us exactly what you are seeing and not vague generalities like "it doesn't work", I'm getting an error message", "this is a corrupted installation" - what does that mean and why do you think
 your installation is corrupted?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Well these are two, identical Dell Latitude D830 laptops, both with XP-Pro COAs, one installation working fine and the other corrupted.&nbsp; Both sets of hardware, including SATA HDD, are thoroughly tested and not in question.&nbsp; The problem is clearly due to
 the corrupted installation on one hard drive.&nbsp; I can put the problem HDD in either laptop and get identical results.&nbsp; The corrupted drive passes chkdsk and spinright.<br />
<br />
I'm using the Dell XP-Pro SP3 reinstallation CD.&nbsp; In case you don't already know, Dell's disks are very close to the generic OEM disks, functionally identical as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Dell's disks are not at all like the crippled atrocities that HP, Toshiba,
 et al.,supply.<br />
<br />
I don't know the conditions that led to the corruption, and I don't know what apps are/were installed.&nbsp; This basket case was dumped in my lap with no explanation.&nbsp; The only good thing about it is that it has been a good learning platform for me to find out
 about XP's boot process.<br />
<br />
When I try to do a repair installation I do not get the C:\Windows&gt; entry and I am not offered the "R."&nbsp; I would have taken this option long ago if I could have.&nbsp; That's why I'm emailing you.&nbsp; Why is setup not recognizing the existing installation?&nbsp; (It's not
 a driver issue.&nbsp; This is a Dell machine and a Dell CD. The SATA driver is built in.)<br />
<br />
The installation has no filesystem errors when checked with CHKDSK on a desktop system.&nbsp; There is a&nbsp; C:\Windows folder, a System32 folder, a config folder with registry files, a driver folder, and everything else I know to look for.&nbsp; I've tried replacing the
 registry with the generic files in the "repair" folder, but it didn't help.<br />
<br />
I've got the installation to the point of trying to boot, but it stops with "Load needed DLLs for kernel."&nbsp; What a classic gem of an error message that is!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT DLLs???<br />
<br />
So, my question is really a generic one, not related to this installation.&nbsp; How is it possible for the Recovery Console to recognize the installation and let me log into it with the administrator's password, yet BOOTCFG can't find it and setup can't recognize
 it and offer me a repair install?&nbsp; What do they look for to identify a viable installation?<br />
<br />

            If your system has SATA drives and you try to boot on an XP installation CD that does not have SATA drivers incorporated (which it doesn't), when you boot into the Recovery Console, you will end up with a C:&gt;\ prompt instead of a C:\WINDOWS prompt like
 you "should".<br />
<br />
To get things to work, you need to get into your system BIOS and temporarily adjust the HDD interface mode to something the CD can understand.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples I have accumulated:<br />
<br />
Where to find the adjustment and how to change it depends on your system manufacturer and BIOS version so you may end up having to just look around for it.&nbsp; If you know your system make and model, we can probably help you find a manual.<br />
<br />
You need to locate and change the interface mode for your primary hard disk in the BIOS so that when the XP Setup loads, it will be able to locate the hard disk.
<br />
<br />
Before making any adjustments, you should make a note of what the current BIOS settings are so you can change them back when you are finished.<br />
<br />
The adjustment varies so here are some examples I have accumulated:<br />
<br />
The adjustment is made in the BIOS and could be under Integrated Peripherals, SATA Device Configuration, SATA Mode or something similar.<br />
<br />
Make a note of what the current settings are before making any changes so you can change them back when you get done or if things get worse.<br />
<br />
After you make the changes, save them and see how things look.&nbsp; You may have to try a few things to get it to behave.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/SATA mode, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI, change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI Emulation Mode, change the mode to IDE Emulation.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode and/or change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA Native Mode, disable SATA Native Mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/Autodetect AHCI, change the mode to Combination.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID Auto/AHCI, change it to RAID Auto/ATA (this was a Dell XPS 420)<br />

<br />
I'm using a Dell XP-Pro CD, which differs from the generic&nbsp; XP-Pro CD in that it includes drivers for all the I/O chips that Dell uses, so, it has native support for SATA drives. No drivers needed.
<br />
<br />
To get things to work, you need to get into your system BIOS and temporarily adjust the HDD interface mode to something the CD can understand.<br />
<br />
You need to locate and change the interface mode for your primary hard disk in the BIOS so that when the XP Setup loads, it will be able to locate the hard disk.
<br />
<br />
Dell's BIOS has a choice of either ATA or AHCi for the drives.&nbsp; I've tried both.&nbsp; No help.&nbsp; Same result.<br />
<br />
Before making any adjustments, you should make a note of what the current BIOS settings are so you can change them back when you are finished.<br />
<br />
Dell's factory default is ATA. So, after I experimented with AHCI, I set BIOS back to ATA.<br />

YES.&nbsp; this is what I see now.<br />

If you choose to boot in Safe Mode, does the system hang with this being the last thing you see on the screen:<br />
...system32\BOOTVID.dll<br />
<br />
Ohhh.&nbsp; I forgot to try safe mode after I got the boot files replaced/repaired. <br />
No. It goes a little farther, beyond BOOTVID.&nbsp; It stops on "\WINDOWS\inf\biosinfo.inf."&nbsp; So I guess I need to copy the biosinfo.inf from the good installation over to the corrupted installation.<br />

            I don't know how a Dell boot CD works - I know how XP boot CDs (and homemade boot CDs) work.<br />
<br />
You can make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and be sure what you have.<br />
<br />
You still have not said what the prompt is when you boot on the CD, so I am moving on to my siesta now.<br />
<br />
For the load needed DLLs for kernel issue, the example I posted is what you would see if this file is missing or corrupt (the same message for both cases):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\kdcom.dll<br />
<br />
If your system hangs on a file in Safe Mode, the problem is usually not the last thing you see on the screen for it has already loaded - it is hanging on what comes after that and I have no idea what that might be, but somebody else might.&nbsp; You can replace
 the file from your good installation and that might work.<br />

            <blockquote><i>I don't know how a Dell boot CD works - I know how XP boot CDs (and homemade boot CDs) work.<br />
<br />
</i>Dell's CD seems to be very much like the generic OEM CD except that it includes basic drivers for Dell systems and it recognizes Dell systems so as to not require activation.&nbsp; The O/S is activated as soon as setup is finished, so long as you installed it
 on an appropriate Dell system.<br />
<br />
<i>You still have not said what the prompt is when you boot on the CD, so I am moving on to my siesta now.<br />

C:\WINDOWS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I'm perplexed when BOOTCFG can't find it with a scan.<br />

<i>For the load needed DLLs for kernel issue, the example I posted is what you would see if this file is missing or corrupt (the same message for both cases):&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\kdcom.dll</i><br />

I'll check for kdcom.dll.<br />

<br />
Miraculously, safe mode it is not hanging.&nbsp; It is giving me coherent messages.&nbsp; It told me that biosinfo.inf was missing.&nbsp; I confirmed this and replaced the missing file.&nbsp; On the next boot it told me that there was a problem with \System32\drivers\pci.sys.&nbsp;
 I tried to replace pci.sys but got the access-denied error, so I assume that I have to take ownership of it first.&nbsp; So that's what I'll do next.<br />
<br />
Thanks for staying with me.&nbsp; I'll report again when I have more to report.<br />

<p>When you say "invisible" do &nbsp;you mean that you see rectangles but they show yellow triangles with exclamation points rather than an actual thumbnail?</p>
<ul>
<li>This just means that Movie Maker can't find the actual media files where they were stored previously. Double-click on one of the problem clips and navigate to the new location of the file(s).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Or do you mean that you don't see anything at all in your storyboard area?</p>

<p>Normally you would see something like an inTime of 8 seconds and an outTime of 20 seconds. That means you have trimmed the video to that 12 second portion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in your case, all the outTime values are 0. I would try editing a *copy* of the file and changing the outTime values to be a value greater than the inTime. That will at least let you open the project and see the clips again. Then you can fix them in
 Movie Maker to be the correct lengths.</p>

                    <p>I have just bought a new computer that came preinstalled with Windows 10 Anniversary update and I am setting up a relative's account onto it but for some reason her Microsoft Account User picture, themes, and settings won't sync even if we have changed the

 this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Ran the Microsoft Account troubleshooter, it comes up with an error saying can't connect to sync services which was detected but it doesn't attempt to fix it. If I were to guess maybe there is a maintenance going on with the Microsoft Account Servers
 maybe?</p>

            Hello Zelda,<br />
<br />
Let's have that resolved. Follow advised methods and steps provided below to resolve the issue you're having:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong> – <strong>Change Feedback and Diagnostics Settings</strong><br />
The main cause of sync problems for most people are wrong Feedback and diagnostics settings. Once you change Feedback and Diagnostics settings, you should be able to sync your settings normally again. To change these settings, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Open <strong>Settings</strong><br />
2. Go to <strong>Privacy</strong>, <strong>Feedback &amp; diagnostics</strong><br />
3. Your Diagnostics and usage data settings are probably set to Basic. Just <strong>
chang</strong>e it to <strong>Enhanced </strong>or <strong>higher</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Changing Feedback and Diagnostics settings should solve the sync problem. But if you’re still unable to sync your settings, even after changing the Feedback and diagnostics settings, than something’s probably not right with your Microsoft
 Account.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong> – S<strong>ign in With Different Microsoft</strong> <strong>
Account</strong><br />
Since syncing and Microsoft account are tightly connected, if you’re not able to sync your settings, maybe your Microsoft account is damaged. To check that, you should
<strong>log in</strong> with <strong>another Microsoft accoun</strong><strong>t</strong>, and see if the problem still exists. Once you login to the new Microsoft account,
<strong>check</strong> if you’re able to <strong>sync</strong> your <strong>settings</strong> now. If you are, problem was definitely in your previous account.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have questions.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>I have this issue, too. &nbsp;Method 1 showed I was already set up correctly. &nbsp;Method 2, I signed in as another user and that account info syncs just fine. &nbsp;Still the main account won't sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my account must be damaged. &nbsp;How can you fix a damaged account?</p>

            <p>I actually contacted Microsoft Support through Live chat and find out it is a problem with the account itself as all other Microsoft Accounts work fine. They sent me a link to a page to report issues specifically for Microsoft where they can look into the
 issue and figure out the problem and fix it. I should get an E-mail back from them soon. I downloaded the Microsoft Account troubleshooter on the device I discovered the issue with and a few more devices with the same account linked to them and they all reported,
 Cannot connect to sync services. Hopefully Microsoft can fix it.</p>

                    Marilyn,<br />
<br />
I'm writing here because I have the same problem with VMware installation.<br />
<br />
What if I have my Windows 7 installed in December 2010, now is June 2012 and I kept it up to date all the time? To solve issue your way I would need to remove all updates and service pack and install them again? I think that reinstalling the system would be
 easier and less time consuming.<br />
<br />
It is not very specific approach, is it? <br />

            <p>Hello MarciejDomanski, <br />
<br />
I have split your question into a separate question due to the age of the old post.
<br />
<br />
Original Thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/error-setup-cannot-continue-the-microsoft-runtime/648d5183-d73c-4fd5-b626-d29edfdfa118">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/error-setup-cannot-continue-the-microsoft-runtime/648d5183-d73c-4fd5-b626-d29edfdfa118</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when did the problem start occurring on your system? You would not need to uninstall all updates and services packs. I had the other user do a system restore back to before the issue started occurring when they installed a new security update.
<br />
<br />
So you would only need to either uninstall the update that caused the issue or do a system restore to before you installed the update. You didn't read my thread correctly.
<br />
<br />
If you still don't understand, reply back and post your question. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

    <title>Cannot Delete 3 Windows Store Apps from my Windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boise_id  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Delete 3 Windows Store Apps from my Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10. Windows App Store keeps telling me that I have 3 apps in the update queue that cannot be downloaded.&nbsp;None of these 3 apps appear in my "All Apps" column on my&nbsp;Start Menu, so
<strong>I cannot delete them</strong>. &nbsp;If I enter the app names individually in the App Store, the store shows that the products&nbsp;are installed. Here are the specifics on the three apps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>One of the apps,&nbsp;<strong>EZ Files </strong>indicates "Try that again - something went wrong. The error code is
<strong>0x80073B06</strong> in case you need it." </li><li>The second app is <strong>Tweetium</strong>. The App Store shows that my free trial of this app has expired, purchase it to continue. I do not wish to purchase it, but cannot delete it because it also does not appear in my app list. Under See Details on
 the app store, it says: "Try that again - something went wrong. The error code is
<strong>0x803F8003</strong> in case you need it." </li><li>The third app is <strong>Modern File Explorer</strong>. When Windows App Store attempts to update that app, the see details reads: &nbsp;"Try that again - something went wrong. The error code is
<strong>0x803F8001</strong> in case you need it." </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Those error codes do not help me. I am frustrated, and just want to dump the apps, but can find no way to do that.
<strong>Please help me!</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you make any recent hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which version of internet explorer are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try the below methods and check.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> You may try performing system restore, if the issue has started recently.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Uninstall active and then try upgrading security components.</span></p>

<p><span>You may also check the below steps.</span></p>
<span><em>Step 1: Installing ActiveX Controls from the IE Information Bar</em></span>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Internet
 Explorer (IE) includes an information bar displayed below the toolbar menu for warnings and alerts. If ActiveX is not installed, a website that uses<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5022645_install-activex-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>ActiveX
 controls</span></a> will cause IE to display a message on the information bar:<br />
"Pop-up blocked. To see this pop-up or additional options click here..."</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the information bar. Click Install ActiveX Control.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 information bar will alert you whenever you visit a web site that tries to download a program or file. Click the information bar for more information and to choose whether to download the file.</span></p>
<span><em>Step 2: Enabling ActiveX Controls on IE</em></span>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Launch
 Internet Explorer (IE). In the top menu bar, select "Internet Options" under "Tools."</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the "Security" tab, and click the "Custom Level" button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>A
 list of controls will be displayed. Enable the following:<br />
Allow previously unused ActiveX controls to run without prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5022645_install-activex-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>OK</span></a>" to close the dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "OK" to confirm that you're sure you want to save changes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit
 browser and reopen IE.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong>Check if the issue persists in clean boot state.</span></p>

<h2>            file extensions not showing, even though enabled.</h2>
                    I have a series of problems with Windows suddenly.&nbsp; It seems they are related, because they showed up at the same time.&nbsp; Here are the issues below.&nbsp; Please help!<br />
<br />
1. I like to see the file extensions for all files. I go under "control panel" and uncheck the "hide file extensions for file types", yet the extensions do not show up.&nbsp;
<br />
2. The quick launch bar.&nbsp; It is "locked" and I can't expand it.&nbsp; If I go to "properties" for the taskbar and uncheck the "lock the taskbar", nothing happens.&nbsp; I repeat the process, but still nothing.
<br />
3. All of the icons on the start menu are not there.&nbsp; That is, the entire area above "all programs" is blank.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Virus?&nbsp; Registry issues?&nbsp; Normally, I can figure these problems out, but I am stumped.&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp;

<p>If Google Earth and Google Chrome&nbsp;did not originally come with your Computer you will have to download&nbsp;them again:</p>

<h2>            I forgot my pass and changed it.</h2>
                    A few years ago I had forgotten my computer password so i changed it, but when I tried inputting my new password in it tells me "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device." But how am I supposed to input the last
 password I used if I cant even remember it? I've been without my computer for about 2 years now because it won't let me input my password. And no i cant factory reset because i don't have the power option on the login screen and I can't access the administrator
 account because my keyboard is messed up and i can't type in my current password.. but i fear that if I do end up getting a new keyboard it would be a waste of time because it'll just end up telling me to input my previous password. So anymore options?

<br />
I have previously had versions of skype on this machine (3 or so years ago), which I uninstalled before installing the newer version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps taken:</p>
<p>-Deleted appdata files after uninstalling</p>
<p>-restarted computer after uninstalling</p>
<p>-Ran CClearner after unisntalling to remove temp files and registry&nbsp; changes<br />

<h2>            Skype phone doesn&#39;t react, after dialing the correct phone numer, to requested menu selection digits by the automatic operator and given in through the computer Skype keypad</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Madame, On my Window 10 Laptop with Office 360, the Skype phone doesn't react, after dialing the correct phone numer, to requested menu selection digits by the automatic operator and given in through the computer Skype keypad! I tried it several
 times without any success.</p>
<p>After typing menu selection digits E.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4 the automatic operator on the other side of the phone line always stated that no selection number was received! Therefor the phone connection was automatically disconnected.</p>
<p>Can anyone help and resolve this issue?</p>
<p>When I use Skype phone on my iPhone 7 smartphone and execute the same process as described above it does work and reacts correctly to any selected menu digit.</p>
<p>With kind regards, Robert De Bruyn</p>

<h2>            Access Denied error connecting to Windows 95 server.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm helping a friend of mine set up his new laptop so that he can use it at his work. His office has an old windows 95 file server that is supposed to allow access to all users. When I try to connect to the server however it askes me to enter a username
 and password. Thinking the server is configured wrong I user the username from his old computer (including domain) but I still get an access is denied error.<br />
<br />
Is Windows 7 compatable with these older servers?<br />
If not is does anyone know of any third party software that could emulate this functionality?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Joseph</p>

            "Windows 95 Server"? I'm afraid there is no such thing. Windows 95 was the very first version of the Windows family that was usable (Windows for Workgroups wasn't . . .) and it certainly was not a server. Perhaps it's pretending to be a server. Your friend
 should replace it urgently because it would be about as attractive and accessible to hackers and viruses as a honey pot is to a hungry bear.<br />
<br />
About the password problem: This could be an NT LAN Manager issue as explained here: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistanetworking/thread/8e18df52-eaf0-4758-a1c1-87057d9f96e9<br />

    <title>Win 10 leaving dirty NTFS partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tingchu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 leaving dirty NTFS partitions</h2>
                    <p>I have two (win) NTFS partitions allocated by Win 7, and transferred to Win 10. I have two logical (Ub) NTFS partitions allocated by Ubuntu.&nbsp; Win and Ubuntu has respective operating system partitions.&nbsp; Data generated
 by Win wrote to (win) NTFS and Ubuntu can read them. Data generated by Ubuntu wrote to (Ub) NTFS and can be read by Win. Such set up worked fine dual booting with Win 7. However, several days ago after converting to Win 10, Ubuntu refused to mount both (win)
 NTFS and (Ub) NTFS because the partitions were dirty with cached data generated by Win 10 (according to Ubuntu).&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably by coincidence, the Start menu failed and Win 10 partially crashed. The problem was automatically uploaded to Microsoft, and a fix was
 automatically downloaded after about a day and half.&nbsp; Now, since yesterday or about, although no crash appears, but all the NTFS partitions are dirty again.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I report Win 10 dirty partition problem to Microsoft? &nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>On multiple-boot installations you must have 'hibernate' <em>disabled </em>in Windows 10.</p>
<p>You get that by first starting the command interface in administrator mode;</p>
<p>there you type&nbsp; <strong>powercfg /hibernate off</strong> and press the Enter key.</p>
<p>(With hibernate enabled, Windows 10 may leave the file system behind in a messy state.)</p>
<p>Sadly, one of the next Win10-Updates may well enable hibernate, so you have</p>
<p>to turn it off again.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Home 1511 updates every day to Anniversary version &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherry something  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home 1511 updates every day to Anniversary version &#38; instantly restores back to 1511</h2>
                    <p>I finally had to turn off Windows 10 Updates because every single day it goes through the whole process (multiple reboots, etc.) of attempting to install&nbsp;the Anniversary version. That always ends with "We are restoring your previous version of windows"--with
 no further explanation. It just chunks away until it's back to my desktop, with 1511 reinstalled. In the "Action Center," I get a message saying "We couldn't finish installing your updates." So I go to Link/Updates, and when I click on&nbsp;"More Information,"
 it immediately starts the entire process over AGAIN. It's going to wear out my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I run the Troubleshooter, which finds no errors. I&nbsp;run&nbsp;SFC at the Command Prompt, which also finds nothing wrong at all. This has been going on ever since the Anniversary version came out. What can I do. Everything else on this computer works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

            <p>No, the problem isn't&nbsp;fixed--in fact is worse than ever since Windows Update went through the whole rigmarole again yesterday and then again today. If I leave the computer on and inactive, there it goes again--holding everything up, sometimes for several

            <p>Sherry</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you understand what these files contain?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The files requested are technical reports about how your system works and do not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. They may contain your machine name, your user name, and
 where software is installed. The files do not contain passwords, bank pin numbers, log-ons and complete product keys. It is for you to determine if that violates your privacy. You only need to leave a file in your OneDrive for the limited time necessary for
 the other party to retrieve the file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 5 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a breach of the users
 security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert in computer security but breaches of security occur when a user allows direct access to their computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming email or other communication.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at other threads you will find many other users sharing files, notably by those seeking help with diagnosing the causes of blue of death crashes. Exchanging copies of files is an extremely
 practical way to aid and expedite the finding of a solution to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded
 from using the forum. However, I have never seen the type of abuse you fear reported.

            <p>Okay, I updated both Realtek &amp; the BIOS successfully. Thanks! I'd always been afraid to mess with the BIOS--had a temporary scare when I received a CMOS checksum error, but resetting the default values fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Malwarebytes for some time and it hasn't ever found anything. But I updated it and scanned again, then uploaded the Malwarebytes Log to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't used AdwCleaner before, but I followed your instructions. It found two items (aol.com and ask.com), which have been deleted. Apparently it also deleted "Tracing" keys and cleared the Winsock settings. That log also has been uploaded. Here are the
 links:</p>

</p><p><span><span>To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is
 a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 204, 1)">much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right click Autoruns selecting
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> and select the <strong>Everything</strong> tab. Click
<strong>File</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and, using the scroll to the right, change the “<strong>Save as type</strong>” option from Autoruns Data (*.arn) to
<strong>Text (*txt)</strong>. The file name changes to <strong>AutoRuns.txt</strong>. Click the
<strong>Save</strong> button and upload the file to your OneDrive as a shared file and post as a link here.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A useful feature of the programme is that you can right click an item and select Search Online to get information about the item selected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please run System File Checker. Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X,</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin) </strong>on the drop down menu. Type
<strong>cd\</strong> and press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key. Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key<strong>. </strong>Please say what is reported when the check completes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After the process has finished, you may receive one of the following messages</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Which message was received?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please run the DISM tool. Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X,</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin) </strong>on the drop down menu. Type
<strong>cd\</strong> and press ENTER. Type or copy and paste the command "<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
</strong>" without the quotes and press the ENTER key. Type or copy and paste the command "</span><span>
</span><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong><span>" without the quotes and press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key. Make sure you include the spaces where indicated. These procedures can take a long time to complete so you need to be extremely patient. Type
<strong>exit </strong>when it completes, press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key and restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you get an Error 87 response recheck the command you entered.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the DISM log file</span><span> as a shared file
</span><span>to your OneDrive and post a link here.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to show hidden files. Use the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X </strong>to access Control Panel, Folder Options and select View, Advanced Settings. Verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to
 see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open File Explorer (keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+E</strong>) and locate your C partition. Expand C along the file path C&gt;windows&gt;logs&gt;DISM&gt;dism.log. To expand C click the arrowhead to left of C and repeat with windows and sub-folders as necessary.</span></span></p>

            After DISM's Scanhealth, it said "No component story corruption detected. The operation completed successfully." After DISM's Restorehealth, it said, "The restore operation completed successfully. the Operation completed successfully." Upon exit, the computer
 did freeze on the&nbsp;"Restarting" screen. I let it go for 50 minutes, then manually rebooted and it seems to be okay. However, I didn't get a chance to get the DISM Log yet because Windows Update is working away,&nbsp;again trying to install the big update. (I thought
 I'd turned off the updates but apparently not.) At the moment it's once again back to restoring the previous version. I'll go get the DISM Log as soon as that reversion finishes.

<p>Skype uses Internet Explorer 's engine in the background so the health of IE matters.&nbsp; You need to ensure that&nbsp; no restrictions are in place in the advanced settings of your IE browser/Internet options.&nbsp; If they are, they will inhibit Skype's operation.
 You can try to reset IE in those advanced settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem still continues, you can try my removal tool which will perform some IE resets during the removal process.&nbsp; This removal does not make any changes to your Skype history.&nbsp; It is best to run the program, reboot, then reinstall the latest version
 of Skype for your OS.</p>

<h2>            Clean Install of Windows 10 from USB giving me error code 0xc000021a before install</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 8.1 installed and wanted to do a clean install of Windows 10 on my 120GB SSD. &nbsp;I created a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 on it. &nbsp;When I try to boot from it, it will read the USB, then after about 10 seconds it gives me a&nbsp;0xc000021a error.
 &nbsp;I tried booting from the USB on my laptop and it went to the update prompts just fine. &nbsp;I can find plenty of info of the&nbsp;0xc000021a error code affecting startup, but not an update. &nbsp;I did update using the same USB file without a clean install and it worked,
 but would still like to have a clean install. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You must instlal from the 8.1 disktop to get the free Windows 10. &nbsp;After a successful upgrade, you can clean install all you want and you don't even need a product key. &nbsp;Windows 10 has new licensing technology. &nbsp;If you clean install the first time you will
 need to buy a copy of Windows 10 at retail in order to get a product key.</p>

            I am a MSDN subscriber so I am using the ISO I downloaded from the MSDN website. &nbsp;That is what I have done for Windows 7 &amp; Windows 8 without a problem. &nbsp;I have a product key to use for the clean install. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to copy the USB contents to the drive on your PC and then initiate custom install ie "Keep personal files only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a clean install, it will ask you to purchase Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above statement applicable, if you are upgrading Windows 10 for free from earlier operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about upgrade options, refer to&nbsp; the below article:</p>

</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</p>

            So I tried updating from the original ISO and it gives me the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>0xc000021a error after it&nbsp;restarts for&nbsp;the first time during installation. &nbsp;I reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 8.1
 thinking maybe a startup file was&nbsp;corrupted. &nbsp;But after the new 8.1 install, it is still giving me the same&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0xc000021a error. &nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;Then,
 when it boots back up after the error, it says "0xC1900101 - 0x20017, the installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation".&nbsp;

            <p>So here is where I am at... I currently have a fresh Windows 8.1 running on my machine just fine. &nbsp;I have allowed for multiple updates the past few days to make sure everything is good. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* When I try a custom install and select keep my files etc... everything goes great until it restarts my computer. &nbsp;Then the Windows icon shows up for a few seconds with the spinning circle of dots. &nbsp;Few seconds of that and I get the BSOD with error code&nbsp;0xc000021a
 and forces a restart. After receiving a windows saying "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0xC1900101 - 0x20017, the installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation", Windows 8.1 starts up just
 fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">*When I try a clean install with an ISO that I downloaded directly from MSDN.com, I boot from the bootable USB drive, and I get the same Windows icon with the spinning circle of dots.
 &nbsp;A few seconds go by and I get a BSOD with error code&nbsp;</span>0xc000021a and forces a restart. &nbsp;Computer restarts into Windows 8.1 just fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since the BSOD happens each time with the windows logo and spinning circle of dots, I can only assume it is hanging in the same place both times (at the Safe_OS phase). &nbsp;I hope that
 this thread has not been given up on as I would really like to figure this out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Again, I am a MSDN subscriber with access to the Windows 10 ISO and key, so I am not using the free upgrade to Windows 10.</span></p>

            Hi, I would also have the same problem with my pc:<br />
Because of a failure, I had to change my HD, and I'm trying to re-install windows 10, as I have a Windows 8.1 license key that I had updated to windows 10.<br />
I had already reinstalled the system with a clean installation and had no problems, but for a couple of weeks on this part I can not restore my pc with a new clean installation.<br />
<br />
Every time I go to install Windows 10, I get a 0xc000021a error and the pc reboots in the loop. I also tried reinstalling windows 8.1 and then updating it, but I have the same error when I'm going to install the program.<br />
<br />
On the Internet I have seen that many users have had the same problem, however, being updated from windows 8.1 to windows 10 or updating them.<br />
<br />
So I would like to know how to fix my problem, someone, could you give me a hand?
        </p>

<p>I found an answer that seems to have worked for me...&nbsp; I selected 32 bit install (was selecting 64) and also selected Advanced Feature (F8) and went with Safe Mode.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, after files loaded (via the installer), the first Windows Installation
 dialog screen appeared and I was able to progress with the installation per normal procedures, including entering the Key that came along with my purchase (see below).&nbsp; Note that during this entire process only thing connected to PC was keyboard, mouse, and
 HDMI monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One obvious tip: as per normal Win installation, at some point it wants to restart the computer.&nbsp; Don't forget to interrupt the process and point it back to the hard disk with it's new Win 10 files, and away from your thumb drive.&nbsp; Or simply pull the thumb
 drive out when power cycles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the above, I was having issue very similar to elsewhere in this thread... trying to install Win 10 on thumb flash drive purchased in full from local retailer.&nbsp; Installing onto blank, reformatted hard disk.&nbsp; (Reformatted in another PC running Win
 10 and using included Disk Management tool.)&nbsp; Drive is 100% blank, all in single partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting from the MS Win 10 thumb drive, DOS-like screen comes up asking to select 32 or 64 bit installation.&nbsp; Choosing 64, same screen shows "Loading Files" progress, then repaints to standard Win 10 blue w/ Win logo and circular "working" dot motion.&nbsp; Finally
 repaints to Win sad face and auto restart; includes note about Stop Code&nbsp;0xc00021a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting and selecting Advanced Mode options for Safe Mod, Debugging Mode, and Disable Driver Signature Enforcement all yield same Stop Code result.</p>

<p>To everyone having this issue Follow RSeiersen instructions above - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran across this same issue and after troubleshooting for about 2 hours finally stumbled across the same solution - I was curious to see if other people were having the same issue and it seems this is very common to anyone installing fresh from a USB
 boot device from Mircosoft - </p>
