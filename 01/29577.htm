<h2>            .properties not working</h2>
                    Hi, I accidentally made .properties always open in Notepad so it is now saved as a notepad file and doesn't work. I want it so that i can customise some stuff on a game but it isn't working as it is the notepad file. Any help is much appreciated :)

<h2>            Games stuttering after driver update.</h2>
                    I recently updated my drivers using driver booster 5. I noticed afterwards that games started to stutter. I was getting normal fps (maybe a bit lower in PUBG) but every few seconds the game would freeze for a few frames. I tried a system restore but it
 didn't work. I am going to try reverting each driver that was updated back to before their updated counterparts but in case that doesn't work i need suggestion son what else to do. As you can see in the pic below, i am getting high fps in Rainbow Six Siege
 but the minimum frames in most areas is very, very low.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fddf118-792e-4b29-998e-bd623023e644?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fddf118-792e-4b29-998e-bd623023e644?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>windows updates and auto maintenance in windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows updates and auto maintenance in windows 8</h2>
                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>All,</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I was hoping that someone might be able to comment on something I noticed when it comes to windows updates and the new automatic maintenance feature
 in windows 8. It seems to me that regardless if I have “install [windows] updates automatically” selected, I also must have automatic maintenance enabled or windows updates will not install in windows 8. I see in the windows updates settings “updates will
 automatically be installed during the maintenance window”. Now, I don’t have my laptop on at all times, so the auto maintenance feature never really runs during my ‘down time’. When it does run, it slows my PC down and normally never fully gets done running
 because my PC is only on for at most 2 hours at a time. Honestly, I don’t have any use for the auto maintenance feature because I periodically check for viruses/malware and use CCleaner to keep the junk off of my PC. Am I correct that there is no way to install
 updates automatically, unless automatic maintenance is enabled? It seems weird to me that updates are dependent on this new feature. Having to check for updates manually just seems like a step backwards. Thanks!</font></font></font></p>

            <p>Robear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to your questions:</p>
<p>1) I purchased the upgrade when they had the special $39.99 offer back in December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I don't have any issues installing the updates (most of the time); but my real&nbsp;question here is, how can I get my updates to download and install automatically if auto maintenance is disabled? Under windows updates it says:
<font color="#000000">"updates will automatically be installed during the maintenance window".&nbsp; I don't have a maintenance window due to auto maintenance being shut off (by me), thus windows updates are not going to install automatically. I just want to be
 able to download updates and have them installed automatically without the auto maintenance running in the background. If the updates that you listed fix this issue, then I can go an check to see if they are indeed installed.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">3) I do use CCleaner, but only to clean off junk files, not to mess with my registry entries/errors.</font></p>

Good.&nbsp;That tells us that Automatic Updates (and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh848037(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Automatic Maintenance</a>)&nbsp;must be working OK, despite your concerns.</p>

<p>In short, if Automatic Maintenance is turned-on, Automatic Updates should work even if your computer's not turned on daily or for more than a few hours.&nbsp;That being said, Automatic Maintenance should NOT be causing any slow-downs so we'll explore the cause
 of that next.</p>

            <p>Please see my responses to your questions below in bold. With regards to the installed updates... most of them were not installed automatically, rather I had to click&nbsp;search for updates and then direct windows update to download and install them. Again,
 I believe this goes back to the auto maintenance feature&nbsp;being turned off. </p>

<p><em>Aha!</em></p>

            <p>Robear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your question about the Norton removal tool... I don't believe I did run that at the time. I have heard in the past that Norton and McAfee do not truly, fully uninstall (I did experience this&nbsp;first hand years ago on another PC).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never had any other issues with the computer though and I have found many people online complaining about how long it takes their auto maintenance to run (some say that it takes hours upon hours).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, I just don't understand why Microsoft would make regular operating system updates (which I think are very important) dependent on something else running in the background. Do you agree that you should have the ability to turn auto maintenance off
 or be able to select what exactly you want it to do when it runs? </p>

<p>WYSIWYG and again, I don't think Automatic Maintenance "running in the background" has anything to do with the slow performance. That fickle finger points squarely to Norton!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, there are two (2) ways to address this: (a) Running a somewhat-complicated, multi-step fix or (b)&nbsp;doing a

<p>Let me take a step back.... when I said "slows my PC down", this is very minimal. I didn't mean&nbsp;for this to seem as though I wanted this to be fixed because my computer is unresponsive or anything along those lines. I mean, I think my computer would work
 okay performance-wise&nbsp;with it on, it's just that automatic maintenance will not run fully due to the amount of time that it takes for all of the background maintenance tasks to be run. I don't leave my PC on 24/7 like many others might. I just simply want
 to turn my PC on when needed, have my updates download&nbsp;and installed during the time that I'm on the PC (which was how it worked for me ever since windows update came about), and then be able to shut down without being told that auto maintenance was interrupted...
 or did not finish... or whatever, the last time that the PC was on. If&nbsp;getting rid of whatever Norton remnants that are still on my PC will speed up the auto maintenance process, so that I don't have to sit here and wait for it to finish (if it ever does)
 before I turn it off, then I'm willing to try the multi step process that you are thinking of. I mean... do you think I should just leave it on and see what it does during my normal usage when it comes to downloading and installing updates? I'm just concerned,
 based on the fact that it is supposed to run&nbsp;during your "downtime", which is basically zero if I turn it on when I need it and turn it right off when I don't. Do you kind of see where I'm coming from with this? I just wish windows update would work like the
 old windows update. </p>

            <p>I did read your post.&nbsp; WMM 6.0 is the "classic" version of Movie Maker, just like WMM 2.6; just with a little more robustness built-in.&nbsp; If you want the later Movie Maker 2012 which is part of Windows Essentials, that's a completely different download.&nbsp;
 But <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WMM 6.0</a> should be the interface you are used to, with the

            The security requirement for installing software on Windows 10 is managed through the User type and UAC. Below is a link for more information on UAC in Windows 10.
<br />- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access...</a>
<br />
<br />Standard users will have the ability to install some software that only affects their profile and the Program Files directory. Any software that changes the system or needs to access the root or system drive, will not be allowed. To prohibit all software you will need to give Guest accounts or use a management tool like Windows Intune.
<br />
<br />If you are an educational institution, you may qualify for some free or discounted services like Office 365 and Windows Intune, which will allow you to have total control over each user account and system. I have provided some links below that may prove helpful.

    <title>Send to Default Email Client Fuction Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nismo 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send to Default Email Client Fuction Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, Creators update, Outlook 2016.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that when using my HP printer, I can no longer scan to email as an attachment.&nbsp; Once that button is pressed in the HP software, Windows 10 tries to open it's default email program (in this case Outlook 2016) and it cannot and give error: "The
 HP scan application is unable to open your email application and/or cannot attach the scan to a new email.&nbsp; Please check your email configuration and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seemed to be fine before the creators update, so I thought it may be that HP software was messed up after the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried changing the Windows default mail app to something else and switching it back to try and re-associate the default Outlook 2016 app for email, and that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am thinking it's actually Windows that is the problem.&nbsp; To test, I opened the Windows Snipping Tool and tried to send to email attachment from that menu and it did not work there either.&nbsp; That function does not involve the HP software at all, and only
 deals with Windows OS talking to Office 2016 to send the file.</p>

    <title>Dual-Boot System Upgraded to Windows 10, Now Windows 7 gives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roxie2401  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual-Boot System Upgraded to Windows 10, Now Windows 7 gives LogonUI.exe -Entry Point Not Found - RtlReleasePath</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a dual boot system in the following configuration:<br />
<br />
HDD-0 = Win7 OS, HDD-1 = Win7 OS, WinXP OS. I have successfully booted into each of these operating systems - and the Win7 OS on HDD-1 is an exact clone of the primary OS on HDD-0.<br />
<br />
I just upgraded the Win7 OS on HDD-0 to Windows 10 using the "Get Windows 10" process. I now get the new blue Boot Manger screen with all three OS's listed and I can successfully boot into Windows 10 and Windows XP. But I cannot boot into the Win7 OS on HDD-1
 (which I could before the Windows 10 upgrade). How the upgrade even knew about the other copy of Windows 7, since it was not active and lives on another HDD is beyond me.<br />
<br />
(One strange thing - if I do a cold startup (power on) I get the new Boot Manger screen. But if I do a Restart from Windows 10, I get the old, black &amp; white boot manger screen - and it does list all three OS's correctly, too.&nbsp; This may be "normal.")<br />
<br />
The error message I get when trying to open (boot) the Windows 7 OS is: "LogonUI.exc - Entry point not found. RtlReleasePath could not be located in the ntdll.dll" And, like others, I now get the black screen with "Windows 7, Build 7601 This copy of Windows
 is not genuine (but it was yesterday before the Windows 10 upgrade on the other HDD).<br />
<br />
And like others, I can start the Crtl+Alt+Del to get the screen with users, Task Manger, etc. &nbsp; And, I can run all my applications by manually starting them in a New Task and browsing to the exe file - like Firefox.exe or Word.exe So, it looks like Windows
 7 started and may be running. I just can't get into it - I can even run Cmd from the Task Manager!<br />
<br />
I understand this may have something to do with the faster boot that was introduced in Windows 8 since the problem started around then for other systems, too.&nbsp; Not really sure about this though and don't want to mislead any possible suggestions or help.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think both issues, the LogOn and the "Not Genuine" are both related to the Entry Point no located in the ntdll.dll and the RtlReleasePath could not be located.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point I really don't want to reload Windows 7 since it appears to be running and all the apps can be run manually.&nbsp; And, I sure don't want to "roll back" the Windows 10 to Windows 7 since there may be no assurance the other upgraded Windows 7 copy would
 work again.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this happened after the upgrade of the other Win7 on HDD-0 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Its frustrating since the "Get Windows 10 upgrade" worked well, but I need to still boot into the other OS's - can, just to drive the point home - I could, all OS partitions on both
 HDDs before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope there is a simple solution!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> is<span><span>&nbsp;a Windows startup option that uses the most recent system settings that worked correctly. Every time you turn your computer off and Windows shuts down successfully, important system settings are
 saved in the registry. If a problem occurs, you can restart your computer using those settings. For example, if a new driver for your video card is causing problems, or an incorrect registry setting is preventing Windows from starting correctly, you can restart
 your computer using Last Known Good Configuration.</span></span></p>

            <p>No errors.&nbsp; And by accessing the Device Manger via the Task Manger, no little yellow flags.&nbsp; Plus, this partition of Win7 was running just fine before the upgrade to Windows 10 on the other Win7 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run sfc /scannow from the "damaged" Win7 partition by using the Task Manager.&nbsp; Numerous damaged files were found - why the upgrade to Windows 10 on the other Win7 (HDD-0) partition affected what was on HDD-1 partition, I have no idea.&nbsp; It all looks
 like that LogonUI.exe error that has been around for a long time for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the Win7 OS was running because I could run all the applications from the Task Manager - it just would not log me in correctly and present the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I had an out of date image and used Macrium to restore the Win7 HDD-1 partition and it booted just fine - some apps immediately notified me that updates were available due to the age of the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should have imaged instead of cloning the Win7 HDD-0 partition because something that Windows 10 upgrade did affected both locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully boot into WinXP, Win7 and Win10 ----- after three days of endless boots, trying different things.&nbsp; Sort of bugs me that this LogonUI.exe and Release Point errors have been on this Community for several years and no real solution other
 than reinstall and reload all applications.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right that the issue could be the corrupted image of Windows 7 which you have used on this partition. If the issue is related to Video drivers then you may try to
<span>install the drivers for Windows 7/8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />

            <p>Hi - No, this has nothing to do with previous versions or programs that are not compatible, nor does it have anything to do with video drivers or any other drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is LogonUI.exe not being able to log on.&nbsp; As I mentioned, if I can get to the Task Manager, I can run all my application - I can do everything except get any users logged on to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something happened to the second copy of Windows 7 that was on a separate HDD and separate partition from the one that was upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Nothing "should" have touched that installation of Windows 7 - it was not the one being upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I also pointed out - both copies of Windows 7 booted and ran just fine (as did the Windows XP partition) the day before the one copy on HDD0 was upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loading a previous image of Windows 7 (after the upgrade of the other copy, which is now Windows 10) runs just fine, it just is not as current as the one that Microsoft's upgrade corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check other threads on this Community and you will find others with similar issues with LogonUI.exe - going back as far as when Windows 8 was introduced ---- and no valid solution from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I am concerned, my issue is closed - I had placed a current image of my Windows 7 on a separate partition - worked fine prior to upgrading the other copy of Windows 7 to Windows 10 - but it sure got clobbered during the upgrade and, in my opinion,
 should not have been touched by the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this issue, LogonUI.exe, will exist for others in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Well so much for links that hardly answer the question(s)....</p>
<p>Virtual memory is really slow compared to ram memory,however all OS must have it.</p>
<p>To optimize it,open system folder,advanced/performance,virtual-memory,change button,</p>
<p>set C: to "let system manage" click set 2X,close out.Also,add as much ram memory as youre</p>
<p>pc allows (get quality,get the same type,1 or 2 sided.),get a quality video card,any or all of</p>
<p>these will speed up the pc...Next,get a slave hd,put all youre music,pictures,etc on it,install 3rd</p>
<p>party software to it that isnt used much,keeping C: drive clean,also,put the page-file (virtual-</p>
<p>memory on it),plus leave it on C: too....</p>

            It probably has nothing to do with virtual memory.<br />
<br />
If you want to see if you can fix it without trying a bunch of things, keep reading and reply with the requested information:<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these
 issues.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />

<p>You normally have to do an Upgrade first over the top of your currently installed OS. Then you can do a Clean installation which should automatically activate. Yes it is Free for people running an activated copy of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1</p>

            <p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

For persons who needed to perform a clean install of Windows 10 from the outset, it was a two step process of first validating the machine through the upgrade routine, ensure the Windows 10 Upgrade was activated, then proceed to perform a Reset.

<p><span>HI Bharatpur,<br />
</span><span><br />
When a user presses a button on an IR (Infra Red&nbsp;remote), the remote sends a specific IR code that tells the receiving unit to carry out that specific command. Each button on the remote will generate a specific IR code. Although this IR code is digital, most
 remotes don't just simply send out a sequence of IR on and off pulses. The IR produced by most IR remotes is actually modulated IR.<br />
<br />
The IR output is modulated at a specific frequency, usually around 38 kHz (although frequencies over 100 kHz are used). The IR output is modulated to avoid interference. Modulating the IR signal produces a signal with a carrier, and the receiver can be tuned
 for this carrier. This way the receiver will be able to reject any other IR signals in the area which don't have the proper carrier frequency</span></p>

<h3> dustinjohnson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending &#38; Receiving SMS not working</h2>
                    <p>I want to move to a program that I can easily send and receive SMS messages from one platform where I can login and communicate from anywhere.&nbsp; They must send as SMS and be able to login a browser to view and reply.&nbsp; I want to do this to keep my business
 mobile, and so my assistants can answer questions from text too.&nbsp; Does Skype have this ability????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to send an SMS out, and it worked for the most part (ie. no weird "chunking" of the message and sent normally) however I have not received any response on my Skype account.&nbsp; I really want a portal to answer all messages being texted to my office
 number, and I haven't found any service like that yet.&nbsp; I was hoping Skype could offer me that, but the system doesn't seem to receive my messages when texted back to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I literally bought Skype credit to test this, and now I'm pissed that I can't even see the SMS I sent back to Skype....what a waste of $10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions for services like this?&nbsp; TextNow and other apps send SMS in chunks so their hard to read and receive on some carriers, and no one has an easy "sign in online" web process to answer.&nbsp; Currently just using my personal number with an iPhone
 and my Mac so I can send messages quickly.&nbsp; Thanks for any help!&nbsp; -Dustin</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/56f9c060-3784-461c-ab66-2d07af1d1cee" title="Ric Barline 2">
<p>
</p><p>Based from the URL you provided from your Skype Account link (secure.skype.com/portal/profile?setlang=<strong>en-US</strong>), it appears that you are currently in the USA and upon checking,&nbsp;your SMS was sent to a number in USA as
 well. As per my response yesterday, SMS text messages sent to mobile phones in <strong>
Canada</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Taiwan </strong>and the <strong>
USA </strong><strong>will not display your Skype Name or a validated mobile number</strong>. Instead, these SMS text messages will have generic, pre-defined numbers as the sender ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your mobile number which is currently set as your caller Id will only be visible when you make a call to mobile or landline but not for SMS.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Computer is loading i get this small box that says; The procedure Entry Point GetThreadId could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll</p>

    <title>windows 7. Backup fails, code 0x8100019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francoisecoscarella  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7. Backup fails, code 0x8100019</h2>
                    My comp has 2 hard disks, C used for programs, etc, and D, empty so far with 500 Gb. I want to back up with windows on D, but get the error code 0x8100019. I have plenty of backup space, no language packs, etc.
<div>I read the other answers and the only thing which could apply is the system partition, on disk management. The system reserved part is 100 Mb big, and 38% of it is free, meaning 38 Mb. It is said you need 50 Mb free. I could not understand how to change
 it.</div>
<div>I do not want to format the computer, i would be losing too many programs and updates. Actually, if I manage to get a backup file, I may format it afterwards ( I can put it on an external hard drive). I have noticed lately windows freezes, which make me
 restart the computer and I am afraid it could be damageable, maybe a winsocks problem...</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

            ok. I &nbsp;have read your thread. It points at the same thing. My system reserved partition only has 38 Mb free and that is not enough. How can I free some space in it? or how can I create a new partition? the thread you sent me deals about it, and tells people
 to create a new partition. But how to create it is far from clear. I need a how to in terms I understand. Please?

<p>Hi Jacquilyn<br />
First I located where my emials where stored / saved on my original computer&nbsp;and followed the path:
<br />
c:\Doucments and Settings\....\Loacal Settingss\Applicaion Data\microsoft\outlook\outlook.pst&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,904,657 KB<br />
Then I copied this file onto a USB stick<br />
Then I copied from the USB stick onto new ultra book under a new folder called 'emails'<br />
I then went into windows mail chose file \ import messages<br />
I selected Outlook Express 6<br />
browsed for folder, selected folder 'emails'<br />
selected OK, selected Next<br />
Window pops up with message "No messages can be found in this folder......"<br />
I then found a forum / conversation which said to download (free) mailstore Home which was suppose to convert .pst files to .eml? files to be able to import in windows mail.<br />
This didn't work - when I selected .pst option I got a message saying I needed the commercial version of the software to access?<br />
Hope above makes sense.<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />

<br />
For further investigation, please provide some information about your issue.<br />
<ul>
<li>Have you checked your target folder? Is it empty before you do the import process?
</li><li>Also, have you tried choosing .pst file instead of .eml file?</li></ul>

            Hi Helene,<br />
Yes I've checked the folder and the&nbsp;.pst file in the folder - click on it an a message comes up saying it "outlook data file, must be opened from&nbsp;within&nbsp;Outlook"<br />
and as mentioned in my above comment I did select the .pst option - this was using the program "MailStore Home" but I got a message saying that I needed the commercial version.<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Samsung Smart Switch not working since Win 10 Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Fall Creators Update several weeks ago, have been getting message daily every time I power up computer that restart is required to finish setting up "Asus Support Device". Turns out this is Samsung Smart Switch, which was working fine prior
 to update. </p>
<p>Have tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling but get error message that another install is in progress, finish that install first.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Xbox application - missing from Start Menu, not on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iufdrsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Xbox application - missing from Start Menu, not on Taskbar when running</h2>
                    <p>Ah, another day, another Windows 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my son found that he can't get his Microsoft account to properly connect to the Windows Xbox games that we had downloaded - the Solitaire Collection is working fine, and the Xbox application was working fine.&nbsp; But any other Xbox related games that we
 pulled from the Windows store, he can only run in Guest mode.&nbsp; When he tries to sign in, it gives a message that he has to go to xbox.com to sign in, and when he tries to sign in, he gets a server error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, I did two different chat sessions with two different support people at the Xbox website.&nbsp; With the second one, we discovered that my son's account has somehow become orphaned - he's a child account with no parent account - hence, the issues
 with the sign in.&nbsp; But when I was working with the first support person, that individual had me do something that is now having an unexpected side-effect on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first support person, after having me verify that I had the current version of the Xbox application, had me uninstall that application, shut down, restart, and reinstall the application by downloading it from the Windows Store.&nbsp; The problem I've run
 into is that now the tile is missing from his Start menu.&nbsp; The Xbox application also doesn't show in his "All Apps" menu.&nbsp; But when he goes into the Store, the page for that application just has a button labelled "Open".&nbsp; When he opens the application, it
 doesn't create an icon on the taskbar - so it's as if it's not there at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can repair this?&nbsp; Why can we run the application, yet it can't be selected from the menus or show on the taskbar?</p>

            So the only answer on how to get the icon back is, essentially,&nbsp;to create a new profile and migrate over to it?&nbsp; That seems like an utterly ridiculous answer to the issue.&nbsp; There's no other way to get the icon back, seriously?

            So this afternoon, the icon suddenly reappeared in my son's profile.&nbsp; Didn't do anything - guess sometimes "wait and do nothing" is the best answer.&nbsp; Still think it's ridiculous that the only suggestion I was offered is to create a new profile and move
 him onto it.&nbsp; Doing that seemed to start all sorts of issues that we've been trying to clean up, which ended up bringing about this.

<p>Be sure to stay connected for April though as they will be doubling up the amount of free games for that month. &nbsp;You'll be able to download 4 games on the 360 instead of 2.</p>

<h2>            xbox one media remote</h2>
                    I use an xbox one media remote to access and use apps on my xbox one. The issue i'm having is when i'm inside an app like vudu or netflix, i can't figure out how to exit out of the app to back to the xbox home screen. I tried the menu buttons, but they
 didn't work.&nbsp; so does anyone know how to use the xbox one remote to exit out of an app and go back to the xbox home screen?

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are using an app and want to get back to the Xbox home screen with the media remote, tap the Power On/Home button (the big "Xbox" button at the top) to reveal the guide and select "Home."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to completely close an app, press the Power On/Home button to access the guide, navigate the guide to highlight the app you wish to close, tap the Menu (hamburger) button, and navigate to "Quit" on the context menu.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Printer driver for Epson Stylus Photo 810</h2>
                    I am running windows 7 64 bit and want to install my Epson Stylus Photo 810 inkjet printer. When I connect the printer via a USB port it is not recognised. When I try to manually install it it is not in the list of printers. Downloading the expanded list
 from windows update does not include the printer. The nearest I can find is Epson Stylus Photo 810 (M) which is not the same printer and does not work. Anyone got any suggestions on getting this printer installed?

<p>Make sure you plug the USB cable directly into the computer.&nbsp; Do not use a USB hub.</p>
<p>If this is what you are doing, confirm the cable or swap with known good, also verify that there is not an unknown device in Device manager or Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>I think the 810 (M) driver is correct for this device.</p>
<p>If nothing happens when you plug the device into the computer, that sounds like the failure point.&nbsp; If the driver installation failed, or the DeviceID (EPSONStylus_Photo_81ED1D) did not match your device, then Plug and Play would have popped some error.</p>

    <title>Live tiles for certain apps won&#39;t update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Live tiles for certain apps won&#39;t update.</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having problems with some of the live tiles for my apps (but not all apps). Apps like finance, calendar, mail, weather, etc. update just fine. Other apps like news don't update at all. Third-party apps that I use like News Republic, News Bento, Youtube+
 aren't updating either. So it's not that none of my apps are updating, but it seems that some are and some aren't.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried turning off and on my computer, I've tried the app troubleshooter program, I've tried syncing my licenses from the Windows Store and I tried the Windows store reset, but none of those things have helped. And yes, I am&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to the internet
 and the live tiles are set to on. I use Avast antivirus if that helps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I understand that you are unable to open some of the apps in the Widows 8 computer.</p>
<p><br />
1. Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue? If yes, what were those changes?</p>
<p><br />
You need at least 1024 X 768 screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768. Make sure that the screen resolution meets these
 requirements. You can check this by:<br />
<br />
a) Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “Screen Resolution” from the menu.<br />
b) Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.<br />
<br />
Let’s try out some basic troubleshooting steps and check the issue. Let’s first check try running the App Troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1: Temporarily disable the third party security program and turn off firewall temporarily and check.</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p>
</strong>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to uninstall third party security program, I request you to contact its technical support to temporarily disable the program and then check the issue.<br />
<br />
Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon
 as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Run the Apps Troubleshooter<br />
</strong><br />
Let’s first run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes
 some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a><br />
<br />
For more information, you may also refer the article: “What to do if you have problems with an app” from this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a><br />
<br />
If the troubleshooter was not able to find and fix the issue, then let’s check if you are using a proxy Internet Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p><br />
Also, make sure the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer. To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys on the keyboard, type “Account Control” in the search bar and press “Enter”.<br />
b. In the “User Account Control Settings” window, move the slider to the default settings and click “OK”.</p>
<p><br />
