    <title>Can I use Laptop in AC mode without actually removing the battery&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I use Laptop in AC mode without actually removing the battery&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have a question regarding use of battery vs use of the power cord.</p>
<p>I have an ASUS X556U running on windows 10. </p>
<p>I have noticed a strange bulge on the left palm-rest, extending to the keyboard and touchpad. I looked it up and I think it may be the battery swelling up. Now, I didn't check it up because I'm afraid I'll break the warranty seal (if any). I plan on contacting
 the firm regarding this problem, but in the meantime, is there any way I can "decouple" my battery without actually removing it, and use just the AC power plug? Would this help in any way if not for solving the problem, at least in delaying it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day, everybody!</p>

            Hi Mihnea.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should contact Asus Support immediately as it could be a dangerous situation with the battery.  If you cannot remove it then I'd not use the laptop until you speak with them.  
<br />
<br />If the PC is still within a year of purchase it has a Support, repair and replacment warranty you should use to get all problems resolved before it expires.  I would not delay because you need to then check that the repair or replacement is worth keeping  
<br />
<br />Even if out of warranty they should talk with you about a potentially dangerous battery Situation.  Have you checked the Asus SUpport web page for your model to see if there is a battery notice or recall?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Hi Mihnea-Calin-MihuDragostin,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there is no way to turn off battery charging from the AC.
<br />
<br />However there are AC adapters with a center pin called SMART adapters.
<br />
<br />The pin is used to communicate with the CPU.
<br />
<br />When the battery reaches 100% the CPU tells the adapter it is full and not to charge the battery any more.       
        </p>

            Hi  Mihnea-Calin
<br />
<br />If you are getting a swelling in the battery area of your laptop, it is not safe to use on Power, you run the risk of a lithium fire, which can be very dangerous and extremely hard to put out.
<br />
<br />Whether the laptop is or is not in warranty, you should immediately contact the manufacturer and demand a replacement, this is hardware failure and they are liable to replace not just the battery, but the whole unit . . .

            <p>I understand your screen is not vertical now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the cat is not smarter, just clumsy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like your display adapter maybe the reason.</p>
<p>By default, pressing Ctrl+Alt and any of the arrow keys of the keyboard will rotate the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Press Ctrl+Alt+ the up arrow key of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Or press Ctrl+Alt and&nbsp; any of the arrow keys until the display is in the correct orientation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Check the result. </p>

<h2>            Re-enabling the disabled only account  on w10 stand alone desk-top</h2>
                    <p><br />
Jul 11, 2016<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>I was upgrading my stand-alone desk-top&nbsp; W10 from W7 Pro. It&nbsp; locked me out at the login screen without any way to get into system or shutdown other than physically turning off the power.<br />
</p>
<p>Going through the not visible last user name's dir indicates in desktop an entry of
<strong>system crash and w10 automatically recovering</strong>.&nbsp; However, after that the system got into a
<strong>default small desktop instead of the big one </strong>when it first booted with upgraded W10
<strong>from W7</strong>.&nbsp; Wanting to go back to W7, the system wanted to delete the new user account created.&nbsp; The situation is I have to get rid of the only new account that was the same id as the original W7 account but with a different desktop icons/apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to create a new admin account, disabled the default login admin account with the old name and new user admin name and password&nbsp; filled up - both done in the same window- some thing happened, or I shut down the system probably, before saving the
 dialogue.<br />
<br />
This lead to starting system with no way to login. The error displayed on the login screen is&nbsp; "Your account has been disabled.Please see your system administrator" without the arrow for other users and guest. In place of&nbsp; 'password entry'
<strong>OK</strong> is shown.&nbsp; Further, there are<strong> no other buttons for shut down or ease of access shown.</strong>&nbsp; I do have boot-able pen drive that has the install-able W10 setup.<br />
</p>
<p>Going through the question on this in MS site and other sites&nbsp; have been of no use.&nbsp; Using safe mode via the pen-drive, enabling the default admin, guest, and users, do not show the default admin login.&nbsp; 'Net users' shows three accounts.&nbsp; Setting the 'default
 admin' displays one or more errors but making it active completes with success.&nbsp; Creating and adding new user and local group are alive till exiting the safe mode.&nbsp; On rebooting '<strong>normally</strong>' goes back to the square one -<strong> locked up screen</strong>.&nbsp;
<strong>Users </strong><strong>dir </strong>does <strong>not </strong>show the user displayed on the locked up screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to&nbsp; re-enable the new system created user account again or reinstall without losing all the Program Files and Program Files (x86)&nbsp; the available setup option&nbsp; through the reset(reinstall) while in safe mode?&nbsp; I don't think this has admin/system right.<br />
</p>
<p>My dead line to revert to Windows 7 runs out in about 4 days.&nbsp; Any way out other than
<strong>resetting</strong>, which looses all the old 86 and 64 programs and setting, would be of great help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
<br />
Riki<br />

Thank you Kalpana for your suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I doubt the scan will help any as the problem is
<strong>disabled login account</strong>.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; w10 crashed and recovered but with a new minimal desktop instead of the w7 desktop with lots of things.&nbsp; The msg on the screen was it would take one hour to fix hard disk but came back in about 15 or so minutes.<br />
<br />
2. It took me 4 days to figure out the screen colors and unwieldy desktop.&nbsp; I wanted to go back to w7<br />
<br />
3. Then system crashed and self-recovered with the use-id same as the W7 and previous W10 but very minimal, probably default, desktop.&nbsp; I could copy the old desktop stuff the new one.&nbsp; Worked okay for<br />
1 1/2 days.&nbsp; Reverting to W7 needed the new user to be deleted.&nbsp; It puzzled me as I did not create any.<br />
<br />
4. I wanted to create new admin user to check out the new I/F of W10.&nbsp; I got into the right screen disabled the login account and filled up screens to create the new admin user.&nbsp; I do not remember whether I&nbsp; completed all steps.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Either I turned off power or power went down before leaving for a few minutes.&nbsp; After the break, the system booted as in 3.<br />
<br />
6. yahooing/googling lead me to various solutions none being fruitful.&nbsp; Default admin account was inaccessible&nbsp; as there was no way to get out of the locked out screen with no button or anything else.<br />
<br />
7. Using bootable W10 setup pen drive I could get into safe mode (selected 3rd choice with cmd prompts).&nbsp;&nbsp; Was able to look at various files, visible and non visible on the root (c:\) dir and others.<br />
<br />
8. Login user was not found in 'users' dir. Old ones were there.&nbsp; The default&nbsp; dir's were there.&nbsp; Enabled the default admin, user and guests were present.&nbsp; Going through the ct login user desktop lead me the discovery of the crash and auto repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; net users
 showed the 3 default ones. Using 'net user administrator'&nbsp; or 'net users' command reported one or more errors.&nbsp; All&nbsp; 3 activations&nbsp; completed successfully.&nbsp; Creation of local group and users worked okay with 'net user'.&nbsp; These
<strong>lasted </strong><strong>until I exited </strong>the safe mode to start normally without the pen drive.<br />
<br />
9<strong> Starting the w10 normally went back to square one</strong>!<br />
<br />
10. So, is there <strong>any way to activate the disabled user-id</strong>?&nbsp; The setup disk does not give choice of reverting to W7.&nbsp; The choice to reset without losing user docs but killing his programs (apps) and settings could be usable but I need to install
 whole bunch afresh, some of them may not even be on net any more.<br />
<br />
11. I suspect 'reset' will also kill 'Windows.old'.&nbsp; I wonder revert to W7 would&nbsp; be possible then.&nbsp; Pretty sure saving the program files with the&nbsp; registry,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be of much use.&nbsp; Anyway way to edit the SAM hive through 'regedit' for fixing the problem
 and saving it for normal boot.&nbsp; I could not see the 'locked out&nbsp; disabled user' through the 'regedit'.<br />
</p>
<p>My time to revert runs out on about 18th.&nbsp; Of the one month, I have spent 18-19 days on&nbsp; this lockup problem!
<strong>Is there a way to extend this grace period?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Riki</p>

            <p>Hi Riki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed reply and to know that the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you delete the account then it is not possible to activate the account and should not make any changes to the account if you want to revert to Windows 7 and it is valid for only 30days! And also system should be connected to power card when making some
 significant changes to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try Startup repair and check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists you can try System Restore using the Windows 10 ISO.</p>

</p><p>Thanks kalpana for trying.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bootable pen drive with both 32, and 64 bit W10 system installable was the one&nbsp; used for getting into the safe mode.&nbsp; DVD image also will do the same as the open drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start up repair failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. sys restore points failed as no sys restorint were made with w10. within the short duration 4 -6 daysto learn the w10 and sys crapped out.&nbsp; And obviously, there was no sys restore points created on upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. There was no system image created as that would have meant huge backup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There was no option to go back to W7</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Both options to reset failed as the system complained as some thing not doable,</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Re-install had both w10 pro and w10 options; but both failed complaining about boot partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. BCDedit failed because the system was W10 with no way to stop the boot process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. All the data and program files, old Wxp and w7 users accounts and the the w10 recovered dir were okay. except I renamed the dir to remove the&nbsp; user account that locked up as it was disabled&nbsp; due to probable premature power down.&nbsp; However, if booted normally,
 the w10 chugged along merrily to its locked up disabled account name!&nbsp; Is this user account stored encrypted securely due to MS's protection of its SW?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Default admin accounts don't show up on the locked up screen even though they were enabled with net user cmds. So, are the buttons on that screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. So did saving utilman,&nbsp; copying cmd.exe to utilman and rebooting naormally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. The windows files and windows.old are all accessible from command mode.&nbsp; Many files can be copied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12 . Finally , xcopying has some out of memory problem and it could not copy all the files although dir cmd lists then all okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 30 days ran out on17th&nbsp; if 720 hours are used or yesterday if calendar used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that you don't run into a case like mine.&nbsp; At least you can&nbsp; quickly tell them what you have discovered now.</p>

<p>Hi Kalpana:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect there&nbsp; is a time lock,&nbsp; because suddenly yesterday, exactly after 30 days, I could get 2 options,&nbsp; w10 and w10 Pro recovered. The w10&nbsp; pro does complain about w10\system32\winload.efi being missing or corrupted with status 0xc000000f.&nbsp; Restarting
 with setup usb drive, and going to repair the computer does not correct the problem.&nbsp; Where is w10 located?&nbsp; The w10 is at the root directory (c:\).</p>
<p><br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
w10 seems to work okay with built-in&nbsp; admin.<br />
<br />

    <title>Unstable boot of W10 after upgrade from 1803 to 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david tomason  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unstable boot of W10 after upgrade from 1803 to 1809</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm diagnosing a real puzzler here. &nbsp;System is Windows 10 64 bit, 128 GB RAM, Intel 7980XE on Asus platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System runs without incident on 1803. &nbsp;Only errors in Event Viewer on boot are a few DCOM errors that I've backtracked as harmless. System restarts and shuts down fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let it install Feature Upgrade to 1809, or clean install 1809 from USB, I get very strange behavior. &nbsp;The behavior that occurs most often is that after entering passcode on the login screen, the system begins flashing a black screen with the words "Hi"
 or "This may take several minutes", alternating between the two of them. &nbsp;If I let it run, it just looped like this for over an hour with no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is strange is that it doesn't do the above at every boot. &nbsp;About 30% of the time, I can log in successfully with no problems whatsoever. &nbsp;When I go to the Event Viewer to see what happened around the problem time, I get a long list of errors as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"User Profile Service Failed Logon, Remote Procedure Call Failed". (usually about 7-8 of these in a row)</p>
<p>"LoadUserProfile call failed with the following error:The RPC server is unavailable."<br />
"Application Popup: &nbsp;svchost.exe &nbsp;Instruction at ###### referenced memory at #######. &nbsp;The memory could not be written."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Because the errors varied across boots, and it sometimes booted fine, I figured it may be a bad memory stick. &nbsp;But the W10 standard memory test on the 128 GB produced no errors across 5 runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it does this behavior no matter what is installed or running, because it happens even if W10 1809 is installed cleanly from USB. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen similar behavior, or have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time!</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Thank you for your reply. Yes, all of the relevant diagnostics were run without any errors. &nbsp;These include the Microsoft memory check mentioned in the OP, sfc scan, DISM images, as well as chkdsk on the SSD. &nbsp; I may have just run the Basic memory tests,
 so will do a Standard run if it may reveal something. &nbsp;But the Basic run ran many times without incident. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the problems can be replicated easily by installing 1809 on a fresh SSD. 1803 runs fine, but 1809 throws all sorts of errors, with no software installed and no user profile changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware I'm using is a bit of an outlier - the 18 core Intel Skylake part with 128GB of RAM - but I would think there'd be many reports of this problem if there were fundamental incompatibilities. &nbsp;I may look at the Asus forums for similar stories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do next, except perhaps disable BIOS motherboard devices in isolation. &nbsp;I have Acronis image backups of 1803, so data loss is not an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas are appreciated!</p>
<p>

            It tries to repair Windows with the improved Windows 1809 ISO, since the first version of 1809 had some errors.

<p>I saw that awhile back. &nbsp;Even a fresh 1809 install media created a few days ago with the MS media tool didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may begin looking for tools that allow me to step through the boot sequence, to determine what event is kicking off the cascade of errors. &nbsp;It seems to usually be the failed LoadUserProfile call.</p>

<h2>            BSOD 0xc0000135 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday as usual I went to sleep, didn't turn my laptop off (no sleep). Today, however, my pc was stuck on a bsod, posting 0xc0000102, I tried automatic repair, and after that untill now its posting 0xc0000135 everytime I try to turn on my laptop.</p>
<p>P.S I tried opening the cmd and running chkdsk. The weird thing is, that The path drive was X:, I don't even have such a partition. So I changed it to C: and at the moment I have chkdsk /f /r running. Help</p>
<p>?</p>

            Hi ScumBucket,<br />
<br />
Formatting your hard drive and reinstalling Windows 7 often may not be good for your hard disk. It may cause damage to your hard disk. So refrain from reinstall your Operating System.<br />
<br />
However you may try booting your computer in safe mode and check. <br />
<br />
<strong>To boot into safe mode, follow the below steps:</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows
 logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode) .<br />
Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights<br />
<br />
<strong>If it works fine in Safe Mode, perform Clean Boot and check.</strong> <br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<strong><br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div>ok i will try what you suggested</div>
<div><br />
<div>but i also i provided minidump files... do they not tell anything specific about the problem i am having? i thought they were supposed to?</div>
<div><br />
<div>the stop error code that i got on the blue screen was: 0x0000004E (0x00000099, 0x0004ABA7, 0x00000002, 0x00052008).</div>
<div><br />
<div>PFN_LIST_CORRUPT</div>
<div><br />
<div>so, after doing some research on this, I ran the Memory Diagnostic Tool and it said...</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Windows Memory Diagnostic.&nbsp;<br />
Your computer has a memory problem. <br />
Memory problems can cause your computer to lose information or stop working. to identify and repair the problem, contact the computer manufacturer."</div>
<div><br />
<div>so does that mean that the problem is definitely the physical RAM and I have to get it replaced?</div>

<p>hi, my name's anaru and i earlier was on a support chat with 'Paul Andrew' he was very helpful and he suggested to post a request for a forced gamertag change from you guys because latley I've been getting alot of hate and abuse message towards my gamertag
 because aparently i was posted in a youtube video anyway i have no money to pay for a new gamertag so as i said he directed me to you guys and guranteed me a succesful free of charge force gamertag thank you all for your help and happy 2014 :) i hope this
 is able to happen as i was guaranteed.</p>

<p>First off this is a known scam.</p>
<p>Second, support wouldn't send you here.</p>
<p>Third, if a forced change occurs the PET generates a random tag with zero input from you.</p>
<p>Fourth, lying to support is never a good idea.</p>

<p>First off i am not scamming i can copy and paste the messages.</p>
<p>Second, you have no proof of this as a scam.</p>
<p>Third, i was promised/guaranteed a forced gamer tag change from a support member.</p>
<p>Fourth i didn't lie.</p>
<p>and also as i said i was promised a forced gamer tag change so lying to a customer is never a good idea either and this is nor free but help to a customer who is being abused due to his XBL GT.</p>

<p>There's at least a half dozen of these that get posted every day and it never works. &nbsp;So yes, it's a known scam it's just a poor one. &nbsp;Hey, look at that someone else just posted one a minute ago but this time it was "in a forum" which is more creative than
 the youtube version I admit. &nbsp;Point being these people--including you--never get a free switch to a name of their choosing. &nbsp;If you want to change your tag then pay the $10.</p>

<p>well maybe instead of accusing people of scamming etc, you should keep your nose out of peoples business when you have absolutely no proof whatsoever maybe if you could show me some proof i myself am lying (although i'm not) because unlike you &nbsp;i have proof
 of these abusive messages within my xboxlive message box, do you have access to my profile? no you don't therefor how could you know? you're just a rude person who makes false accusations of my and other peoples issues.</p>

<p>Hello Killa Ma0ri :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fully take on board that you have been told by chat support to come and post here and request a forced gamertag change. Unfortunately, it seems like you may have been mislead because the only way to get a forced change is from the Enforcement Team (PET)
 and they will only ever do that if your gamertag is deemed as offensive. You are offered the chance to change your gamertag for free during the initial sign up to Xbox LIVE and if you have used that free change or if its expired, then you would have to pay
 for the change yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are getting abuse from other users on the service, the best thing to do is to file a complaint, which will send a report off to the PET. Once they receive the complaint they will take any action necessary once they reach a conclusion. Further more,
 you can Block, Mute and Avoid other players. This will prevent any further communication and make it very less likely that you are placed in online gameplay with them again. You can find guidance for the above actions by clicking
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Cloud</p>

<p>The only time you get a free name change now is when you first set up your account.You only get a forced name change if your gamertag breaks the code of conduct,yours does not.Even then,you are issued a random name &amp; will have to pay if you want a personal
 gamertag.</p>
<p>Support often send people to the forums when thy can't help but they shouldn't as it will achieve nothing.</p>
<p>Block comms with anyone sending abusive messages &amp; report them via your console,you can even set up comms to friends only.</p>
<p>If your tag has been posted on youtube without your permission then you will have to contact youtube to get it removed.</p>

<p>Asking for forced Gamertag changes as a means of dodging the responsibility of paying for it like everyone else is rather akin to asking the police to give you a ride home from work because you don't want to pay for a cab. &nbsp;A Gamertag change isn't that expensive,
 but if you really don't want to spend cash on it, I might recommend Bing Rewards. &nbsp;www.bing.com has a rewards program wherein regular use of the search engine yields reward points, which can be redeemed for a variety of things in their catalogue, among which
 is Xbox Live Gift Cards. &nbsp;Wouldn't take long to earn enough points to afford a Gamertag change at no out-of-pocket cost. &nbsp;And as an added bonus, unlike the Forced Gamertag Change, you get to pick your own new Gamertag.</p>

<p>That's true, Daft. &nbsp;I'd like to see similar programs run in other regions, or the Bing Rewards program opened up to other regions. &nbsp;Probably issues with a company in the US providing gifts of any monetary value to people in another economic market. &nbsp;But
 I don't see what's stopping partners in other countries working with Microsoft to provide similar benefits to users around the world.</p>

<h2>            This device is being used by another application - Windows 10 - Thinkpad W541</h2>
                    <p>Anyone have a solution that works for more than 5 minutes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i have my laptop in a docking station wired to a 32" monitor, a Fios router, a&nbsp;Logitech webcam/microphone, and&nbsp;a Sony surround sound system that is about 8 years old. The surround sound system is&nbsp;connected to a Fios cable box, which is wired to a 46"
 Samsung TV (also about 8 years old). The goal is to utilize the surround sound (with Dolby Atmos)&nbsp;when i'm using the laptop and both monitors. If i'm watching TV and only using the 32" monitor with the laptop, after i change the channel on the receiver, the
 surround sound contiues to provide audio for the TV,&nbsp;while audio for the laptop (if needed) would swtch over to a pair of Bose speakers plugged into the audio jack at the docking station.<br />
</p>
<p>I know i'm not asking too much, because it used to work up until May 1st.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of the sound problems, I also have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The constant&nbsp;Windows update - Definition Update for Windows Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (Definition 1.267.1462.0)<br />
</li><li>Which the Windows Update Troubleshooter likes to ask me if i am aware of pendign updates, and that i should "Apply a fix" that never fixes anything<br />
</li><li>At which time i am informed of the "Repair Windows Update Database Corruption" problem that never gets fixed either<br />
</li></ul>
<p>If anyone can offer advice as to how to shoot the troubles in the following report, I would be most grateful. Then, I will only have the issues with Windows Defener and the Virus and Threat Protction to deal with.</p>

<p>Hi JDBean124,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons that might cause some of your updates to be at halt like a 3rd party anti-virus blocking it, possible incompatible programs that might cause the updates to not push through. In order for you and me to better understand what causes
 the issue, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Upon performing an update, do you encounter any stop codes or error messages?</li><li>Do you encounter the same error message when updating your <strong>Windows</strong> on a different user profile?</li><li>Just to clarify, is this the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> that you've ran on your
<strong>Windows</strong>?</li><li>What is current build installed on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You'll be able to have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box and type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you perform first a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> to ensure that there are no
<strong>3rd party background programs</strong> that might be in conflict when you're performing an update. If you still encounter the same error message, I advise that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong> and name it as
<strong>test</strong>. This is for us to ensure that the integrity of your current user profile's
<strong>PowerShell</strong> is intact. Let's address your update concern and head afterwards to your audio concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your response to assist you further.</p>

<p>ErwinJames San,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying and your offer to assist. I will try to answer/provide as much of the requested information as I can, to the point that I understand what you are asking.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Upon performing an update, do you encounter any stop codes or error messages?
<em><strong>I have not encountered any stop codes or error messages.</strong><strong> From Settings&gt;Update</strong><strong> &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, I click on Check for Updates, and after thinking for about 20 seconds (evidenced by a series of blue dots
 moving from left to right) it either stops thinking and does nothing, or it tells me that Definition Update for Windows Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (Definition 1.267.1562) is updating. It reflects 0% and starts thinking again and then just stops. If I check
 the update history it says it was installed successfully. Since May 2nd, this Definition Update has installed successfully 45 times.</strong></em></li><li>Do you encounter the same error message when updating your <strong>
Windows</strong> on a different user profile?&nbsp;<strong><em>I've never tried a different user profile. I am the only user of this laptop and my profile is set up as an administrator profile. That is another issue I am having since the update. I'm getting a lot
 of messages telling me "I'm not authorized" or "I'm not allowed access". My favorite one is when I open
</em></strong><strong><em>Settings&gt;Update</em></strong><strong> &amp; Security&gt;</strong><strong><em>Windows Security&gt;Virus &amp; Threat Protection, I get the following message "PAGE NOT AVAILABLE - Your IT Administrator has limited access to some areas of this app,
 and the item you tried to access is not available. Contact IT Helpdesk for more information." I have to click on "OK" to make the message go away. BUT, if I
</em></strong><strong><em>open </em></strong><strong><em>Settings&gt;Update</em></strong><strong> &amp; Security&gt;</strong><strong><em>Windows Security,
 and click on "Open Windows Defender Security Center", I can select&nbsp;</em></strong><span>Virus &amp; Threat Protection without getting the IT Administrator nonsense. As fr as this laptop is concerned, I am the IT Administrator and Helpdesk.</span></li><li>Just to clarify, is this the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> that you've ran on your

<span>On a positive note, I finally got my surround sound configured...well almost configured. It still doesn't recognize the Dolby HT set up, but it finally acknowledges the 5 speakers and subwoofer, and I was able to calibrate the microphone without
 feedback. I can't exactly tell you how I did it, but it is working at the moment.</span></p>

<p>Well so much for being positive.....I was checking for Lenovo updates and there was a Nvidia graphics driver that needed to be installed. So it downloaded, and was almost done with the install when all of a sudden, my screen went dark, like it needed to
 restart, then it came back and the command window opened up for a couple of minutes, then the screen went dark again, and then it was blue with a message saying my Boot Configuration Data is missing or contains errors. Then it said something about recovery
 tools or a USB key or a Disc. I’ve looked everywhere, i don’t have a USB key, and the only disc i have is for Microsoft Office. &nbsp;I have no idea what to do. and of course, my warranty expired on May 9th. &nbsp;i can’t believe this.....any suggestions???</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping in touch with me. Getting back with your question what I meant by 3rd party programs, this means, any
<strong>non-Microsoft</strong> programs such as Media Players, other browsers, games, as an example. Going back to what you currently experience, I would suggest that you user first that there are no other media devices connected on your

<h2>            How can I change the account I use Cortana with&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a local account for my work Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10. I've signed into Cortana with a Microsoft account, but want to change this to a different account (older Hotmail account). How can I do this please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can turn Cortana off/on and delete any saved associated information with the Microsoft account, but Windows isn't 'forgetting' this account to allow me to sign in with the Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest in Windows 10.<br />

I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected. <br />

            I am using a work email to log onto my laptop but I use my personal account for almost everything else. Is there a way I can change Cortona to my personal account instead of using my work account information?

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />The TPM module is a security chip on your computer that stores certain information regarding your computer's security. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, the default encryption gets overwritten and it should work again. Please check this document:
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/initialize-and-configure-ownership-of-the-tpm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/securi...</a>
<br /> (Troubleshoot the TPM) from Microsoft for more information in the regard. This should shed some light.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

<p>
</p><p>First I would like to thank Dwayne Hall, Kapil Arya and Angel Carreno for their help.
</p>
<p>I found the solution for my problem. I have a Dell Inspiron Desktop PC. To resolve the problem I performed the following steps:</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>When the Dell logo appears, press the &lt;F12&gt; key continuously until the Boot Mode appears.</p>
<p>Select &lt;Setup&gt;</p>
<p>Select &lt;Security&gt;</p>
<p>Used down arrow to select &lt;Firmware TPM&gt;</p>
<p>Disable the Firmware TPM entry.</p>
<p>Save and exit configuration</p>
<p>Worked for me...</p>

                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f3c1b57-7dee-4e6f-b89b-5b8e81c73732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f3c1b57-7dee-4e6f-b89b-5b8e81c73732" /></a></p>
<p>Currently using a new Lenovo Z50 with Windows 10, I'm wondering why my microphone levels are so low. I need to shout just to get anything across (Screaming only gets me 1 bar in the picture above)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/353a6bf9-6eac-4df7-8ea2-dac6a54c5e07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/353a6bf9-6eac-4df7-8ea2-dac6a54c5e07" /></a></p>
<p>I followed some tips on increasing the sensitivity, but that still doesn't change very much.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anybody has any tips so that the microphone picks up noise better? Such that the green bar can pick up to at least half way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried using the "Hardware and Devices" troubleshooter recommended but nothing was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer the other questions:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes before this issue occur? No, it's been like this out of the box, which is about 10 months at the moment.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using your microphone to another computer? I tried using the mic with my earbuds plugged via 3.5mm jack but that was even worse said from my friend. (1 sound level is picked up only if I shout).</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using another microphone to your computer and check if the issue still occur? I don't own any other microphones except the ones attached with my earbuds via 3.5mm jack.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Is there a way for you to uninstall then reinstall your microphone device? I tried some of the tips recommended online about uninstalling and using the generic one or updating drivers but nothing really does the fix :/ (Unless I'm doing them wrong)</li></ul>

<h2>            installing Turbotax 2018 on windows 10 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to install this problem and it keeps telling me there is a conflict, I googled the issue it turns out that the latest windows updates are causing the issue due to the version of anti-virus software.&nbsp; I've disabled both antivirus and the
 firewall per guidance from the TurboTax site, and I am still having the issue.&nbsp; can anyone help me please with workaround this issue?&nbsp; I'm even thinking about uninstalling the updates!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><br />
Yes, you can use the Windows 8 64 bit disc to migrate from 32 bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions</u></a>
</p>
<p>Windows 8 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 8 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 8 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 8 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
<p>If you need to upgrade to the 64 bit version, you will need to do a custom over your 32 bit installed. You said you ordered the backup DVD with your order, so you will have the 64 bit disc.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit. Lauch the Windows Easy Transfer utility in Windows 7 and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can
 have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</u></a></p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk. In Windows 8 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Doing a custom install:</strong></p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 8 64 bit media</p>
<b>
<p>Boot from the media you created to install on another partition</p>
</b>

<p><br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows&nbsp;8 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            There is no option to upgrade from any 32 Bit OS to 64 Bit OS. &nbsp;It requires a fresh clean install in every case. &nbsp;So if you wish to do so you will have to backup all your data, make sure you have all the proper drivers and software installers and from
 there format the drive. &nbsp;Then install Windows 8 64 Bit via the installation media. That is the only way it can be done.
