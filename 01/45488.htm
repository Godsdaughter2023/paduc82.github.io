</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you try connecting the USB cable to another USB port and check?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall USB controller and check if it helps.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type <strong>sysdm.cpl</strong> in the
<strong>Open</strong> box, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the <strong>Hardware</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the <strong>Device Manager</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Right-click every device under the <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> node, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would like you to go to the computer manufacturer’s website to download the updated chipset drivers and install them.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>You do not need to visit the&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;link to download the drivers. It&nbsp;is only for instructions on how to download the drivers.</p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

</p><p>More seriously, questions about what's *best* almost always get different opinions from different people. I see that you already got a recommendation for an anti-virus, and it's a recommendation that I disagree with; I think Kaspersky is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to persuade you that my recommendation is better than ThrashZone's; I just wanted to point out that different people, even technically competent people, have different opinions. Your question isn't much different from asking "which is the

            <p>Your 'Windows Updates' is your best product for blocking intruders from your computer. &nbsp;If the underlying operating system layer is unsafe, nothing installed on top of it, will work as expected. &nbsp;The more programs that exist on your computer, the greater
 your security risk. &nbsp;Even one of the most recommended malware removal programs in many respected forums, does not come without risks.</p>

</p><p>My company has continued to recommend Malwarebytes Free as a 2nd scan engine to scan with regularly; as it seems to remove more user inflicted vulnerabilities, then it compromises; they are very positively involved in the security communities, and have a
 respectable mission they strive for.</p>

            <em><strong>Which Antivirus to buy?</strong></em>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.&nbsp; I want to emphasize that the
<em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are strictly an ANTIVIRUS product</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install only one product in my client’s computers.&nbsp; My support comes as a condition that they use that and only that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Bitdefender is at or near the top.&nbsp; Microsoft’s is at or near the bottom.&nbsp; These are not closely scored, but wide differences.&nbsp; Note also that Norton (Symantec) declines to even participate.</strong></p>
<p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until September 2014, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security.&nbsp; September 2014,&nbsp;Symantec (owner of Norton) decided
 they would no longer sell an Antivirus-only product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of research, I decided on <em><strong>Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp;</strong>
</em>I have installed it&nbsp;120 of&nbsp;those PCs and there has not been a single infection, and this has been over a course of about 17 months now.&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is not expensive. It uses very little of the computer’s resources.&nbsp; One of
 the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its “Wallet” function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients know well that if they install any “Internet Security” (IS) product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that the other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems
 than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose
 the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; The IS product&nbsp;will actually hide the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical home Windows computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection software installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

 it comes up as "saved".&nbsp; I used it to log in and all seems to go ok then I get the log in message again and when I try it comes up "incorrect password" again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried reinstalling live mail but am getting nowhere and am still not getting any email as

 your password, he won't be able to access your account because he can't complete the second step (entering a security code sent to a different address or to a phone, for example). Dumb programs like Windows Live Mail can't do this, either, so you have to get
 a special password for use in this program only. It's easy enough: just follow the instructions under

 doesn't have the expected result. In cases like this, it's often better to repair the installation. This is not harmful and non-invasive. Re-installing should normally be the last resort.</p>

            First to clarify what is happening:- I click for WLM and it comes up as me being "signed in".&nbsp; Then the "log on"&nbsp; picture comes up (not WLM) for server.&nbsp; I log on and it comes up as incorrect password again.&nbsp; If I then sign out of WLM and sign in again
 the WLM sign in picture comes up but with an incorrect password. If I sign in with correct password all goes well and I am into WLM.&nbsp; Then the log on picture comes up and away we go again.&nbsp; It should be simple but why should I have to sign in to WLM and then
 have to log on to server to get to my emails.&nbsp; I have never had to till the last two weeks.&nbsp; The thing I cannot understand is how the WLM sign in page continually gets the saved password wrong

            <p>1. Since it tells me my "password is incorrect", I have to&nbsp;pretend &nbsp;that "I have forgotten it".&nbsp; I am then invited to propose a new (suitable) password. That appears to have "been changed": presumably it is acceptable?&nbsp; But: no!</p>

            My problem, like yours is still on-going.&nbsp; The WLM sign in page refuses to save my correct password and keeps coming up with an incorrect one ie not mine. I have to constantly keep putting in my correct MS account password&nbsp; to&nbsp;get into mail for a few minutes
 then the server log in page comes up and will not recognise my password as correct and off we go again.&nbsp; This has started for two weeks.&nbsp; The advice so far has not helped

<h2>            Problem with Microsoft.NET Framework 4.7.1 update KB4055002 and Canon&#39;s &#34;My Image Garden&#34;</h2>
                    After doing MS update on my Windows 7 SP1 Pro machine (I know that this is a Windows 10 forum, but MS referred me to it), I noticed that I was unable to use Canon's "My Image Garden" software to edit DVD labels to be printed.&nbsp; When attempting to load saved
 labels or create or edit any label, the program would terminate with a nonspecific "Internal Errror" message.&nbsp; Re-installation, even after removing every trace of Canon and My Image Garden from the Program list, various directories and the registry, did not
 help at all.&nbsp; In frustration, I was going to restore a backup image from last month.&nbsp; Then, I decided to try one more thing, seeing if this was due to a MS Update.&nbsp; On top of the list of updates done yesterday was Microsoft.Net Framework 4.7.1 KB4055002.&nbsp;
 I removed it and, voila, the Canon software worked again.&nbsp; I had been fighting with this all day!&nbsp; I hope this information is found useful to others.&nbsp; I notified Canon's Tech Support (b

            Just reformatted my computer because of this this was causing a bit of prob with other softwares I had .&nbsp; I almost decided to reformat it again, Instead I uninstalled the 4.7 .net and reinstall the 4.5 version.&nbsp; Everything seems to work fine now. FYI .net
 3.5 doesn't seem to work anymore.. if you plan to upgrade to a lower version.. .net 4.5 seems ok.

    <title>What is the uproar for privacy concerns over Kinect as compared to any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hellhog  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the uproar for privacy concerns over Kinect as compared to any other device&#63;</h2>
                    So, I see this still continues that people are concerned over privacy with Kinect even though Microsoft has said it is not a spying device and it can be disabled. Yet, why do I not see people complaining about things such as phones, laptops, or webcams?
 No one even mentioned it with the Vision Cam and Video Chat or Uno. No one thinks twice about Tango or some other video calling app on their phone. And no one seems to be concerned that they are being spied on with Skype, Oovoo, etc. on their PC/laptop. People
 sit in front of their laptop, stare at their phone, etc. all the time. Technically speaking, you could be watched/heard anytime if you were being spied on whether its the phone company, ISP, program developer, whatever it be that you can think of. I never
 see concern over it. So why is it that there is such a large concern over the Kinect? This baffles me. Current Kinect users seem to have no problems or worries and no one (or few) seem bothered by today's current devices that are literally everywhere yet a
 large amount of people including some governments are concerned with Kinect 2.0. I just don't understand while people are still worried about privacy. It almost seems hypocritical.
<br />
<br />
If you are wondering. I don't want the Kinect 2.0, I wish there was an unbundled version. And at the moment, I have no intentions of getting a PS4 or X1 so there is no bias. But at this point the whole privacy thing is a joke to me. As far as I'm concerned
 all of these other devices could already be potential 'bugs' so the Kinect is nothing different. Although I firmly believe I do not have my privacy being invaded (and considering I've already filled out a security clearance before, the government is fully
 aware of me). <br />
<br />
What makes you so concerned that the Kinect will invade your privacy as compared to your phone? The idea that the Kinect is watching your living room is a joke. Your phone goes everywhere and could see much more. If you turn your Kinect around and are afraid
 of it hearing you, again your phone goes everywhere with you, and hears everything technically. So why is the concern so hard hitting with the Kinect now? I just don't understand it when technology already exists that have cameras and mics that already travel
 everywhere with us.

<p>hmm lets see never had a webcam, laptop, cellphone, had a Kinect briefly for like 2 days but then at the time wasn't connected to the internet. &nbsp;Don't use any video services such as Skype. &nbsp;So when I say I have a problem with Kinect for privacy reasons I
 am practicing what I preach. &nbsp;Am I being paranoid? Maybe. &nbsp;Is that paranoia without merit especially considering recent revelations? &nbsp;Nope I don't think so. &nbsp;I hear all the time if you have nothing to hide you don't have anything to worry about. &nbsp;I have nothing
 to hide I just value my privacy.</p>

<p>What about your Xbox 360 mic? Never used that? Never left it plugged in even with the console off (technically the console draws power albeit under 2 Watts when turned off)? And I do want to be clear incase someone misinterprets what I mean. I do agree people
 should have a concern for privacy. And with that I respect people's demand of privacy. I just don't understand to those that already have devices that can potentially invade privacy seemingly are only concerned with the Kinect.
<br />
<br />
Also I checked those links, not sure if you are saying they are no different or are different. A camera overlooking a living room from Kinect is no different than someone with a webcam on their computer overlooking any room.</p>

<p>It's been said time and time again on these forums, computers have cameras, smartphone's etc, why are alot of the people comlaining about Kinect not complaining about these aswell?</p>

As I always say, if you really are that concerned about the spying issue ( which I don't believe for 1 second ) then you have a simle choice NOT to buy it, problem solved.</p>

<p>It's ok guys cause according to kinect haters the k2 is garbage can't be used with as a mic and is just a camera. So which is it kinect haters? The ultimate spy device or garbage that can't pick up sound very well and is the same as kinect 1? Lol</p>

<p>Also, if I seem to be beating a dead horse, I'm sorry. I've visit the One General Discussion every so often, often I see threads started by people concerned over privacy issues that seem overwhelming in favor of people worried about it being a spying device
 and I finally got annoyed enough about it.</p>

    <title>Undo only &#34;slightly&#34; working in Fresh Paint. Also, upload - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylorcoomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undo only &#34;slightly&#34; working in Fresh Paint. Also, upload image feature does not texturize image as a painting.</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hello! I recently purchased an HP Envy Sleekbook. Its stats are the following: i5 intel processor @ 1.60/2.30GHz, 8GB RAM, Windows 8 64 bit OS, and an Intel 4600 integrated graphics card. My question is about the undo button in fresh paint. Painting goes
 wonderfully fine until i have to undo. I have seen others press the undo button and their marks are taken away completely. However, my paint marks are still showing, although they are faded some(with horizontal lines running through them.), This allows me
 to see that the button is activating but not working correctly on my system. I am curious if I can update my settings to my video card or do something in the settings to the application itself to fix this. Please let me know. Another problem I am having is
 sort of hand-in-hand with the undo button, or at least I suppose it is. When i go to upload pictures, they upload fine, but they are not brushed in any way. Their&nbsp; texture is the same as their original format. I can, however, brush through them as though they
 are wet. But they do not look painted at all when I upload them initially. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this! I hope you can help.<br />

<span><span>Hi cpmclean,</span></span>
<span><span>
<p><span>• Are you getting this error when you open any Office 2007 application?</span></p>
<p><span>• Does this error occur only with Office applications or with all programs?</span></p>
<p><span>• Did you make any recent changes to the Computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to
<strong><span>perform a clean boot</span></strong> to verify third party application services or startup items are causing this issue. To perform a clean boot we will have to run System Configuration Utility.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform clean boot, follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type <strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the
<strong><span>General tab</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Under
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click the
<strong><span>Services tab</span></strong>, click to select the <strong><span>Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<strong><span>Disable All</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click
<strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. After the computer starts verify whether you are able to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Disable touch via Firmware&#47;hardware, NOT via software drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with a cracked digitizer. I currently cannot repair or replace the unit so I must deal with the cracked screen. I've disabled the touch functionality via the driver "HID-compliant touch screen" under Human Interface Devices in the
 Device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this only disables touch once Windows is booted up. Due to the erroneous touches detected by the cracked screen during boot-up, the computer often locks up on the Surface splash screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to find a way to disable the touch screen via firmware at the "BIOS" level (I know there is no bios, but you know what I mean probably).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Running a netbook with Windows 7 Starter - can't make a Windows VPN (PPTP)&nbsp;connection to a Sonicwall TZ210. The Sonicwall is working okay with other PPTP connections (XP, Win 7 Prof). Does Starter version support PPTP VPN connections to other devices?</p>

            <p>I have the same error but I have an ASUS i5 CM-7860 computer.&nbsp; I have three hard drives that were previously diagnosed as problem drives by Microsoft Techs and they all are giving this same error code as I attempted to install Windows 10.&nbsp; The previous problems
 were all due to being unable to do windows updates.&nbsp; All&nbsp;of this is&nbsp;within the past two years and the fix is to completely re-install Widnows 7 on a new hard drive.&nbsp; And when I get a downloaded Windows 7 it does not install.&nbsp; So I need to use a CD Windows
 &nbsp;7 disk to install the Operating System.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drives by the way are checked by Western Digital and Seagate and they are fine.&nbsp; I use them every day as backup drives.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a fix to this without spending three days re-installing an operating system then installing the updates and then installing Windows 10 and then installing the software I use.&nbsp; What can we do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hello Joe!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you have a moderate NAT type and want to try to get it set to open is that correct? I recommend safely powering down the console and then unplugging it and the network equipment
 from their power for at least 5 minutes. Then try setting it up again and trying again. You should also take a look at this helpful support article and try the steps with in.

<h2>            Xbox Gift Card Balance Missing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am posting because I received a free Xbox $50 Gift Card last November as I was setting up my laptop and I've been seeing it ever since in my Xbox Store Balance. I've bought several apps on the Microsoft Store already. I've been saving my balance of $44.27
 for the Black Ops 3 Season Pass, and today when I went on my Xbox One to buy it, I did not see my gift card as an option. I wondered if this was because the Season Pass was $49.99 so I tried to do it with just the first DLC but I had the same problem. After
 seeing this issue, I looked through both my personal email and my Microsoft email to see mail regarding this gift card but I could not find anything. I spoke through a chat session with an Agent to address this and he told me about an expiration date that
 I was never aware of. I just want to see if there is any way I could retrieve this balance to make my final purchase with it. I appreciate the help.</p>
<p>(My service request number is&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>)</p>

    <title>Connect to the internet via iphone and local network at the same time. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacksonmate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect to the internet via iphone and local network at the same time.</h2>
                    <p>Summary </p>

<p>Now I can connect to my home network router and the iPhone Router (iPhone Personal Hotspot feature) at at the same time.</p>

<p>But I need to configure my notebook to send Internet requests to the iPhone Router not the Home Network Router.&nbsp; And Send Home Network Request to the Home Netwrk Router?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Network address range is 192.168.1.x notebook address is 192.168.1.15 the router gateway is 192.168.1.1</p>
<p>iPhone Network address range is 172.20.10.x notebook address is 192.168.1.4 the router gateway is 172.20.10.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assume I have to put some thing in the HOST or LMHOST files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a local network made up of a ADSL 2+ Modem connected to a Wire and Wireless Router.&nbsp; The computers are connected via cable to to the wireless router.&nbsp; The computers are both Windows XP and Windows 7.&nbsp; So don't use HomeGroup is networks shared folders
 and printers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My notebook connect to the network wirelessly when at home via the above router.&nbsp; When I am not a home connects my notebook connects via my iPhone USB or WiFi connection.&nbsp; Using the iPhone Personal Hotspot feature.&nbsp; I also use the Personal Hotspot feature
 for my Android Table and Backup phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Notebook and other devices automatically connects to my home WiFi network and I manually connect to my iPhone&nbsp;when I am away.&nbsp; This stops the computer using/wasting mobile data cap when I am at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the telecom provider has stuffed up and unplugged my appartment from the Internet.&nbsp; But due to a shortage of plugs in the buildings MDF I have to wait for someone else to disconnect before they can reconnect me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can still use my iPhone Personal Hotspot feature to connect to the Internet from my notebook and other devices when I am at home.&nbsp; When I also connect to the Home network&nbsp;also via WiFi or Cable to the Router.&nbsp; I can access the computers on the home network.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
 the Notebook's Internet requests get sent to the home network when connected to the home network even though the home network has not Internet connnection and I am also connect to the iPhone that has Internet Access via the iPhone Personal Hotspot feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>windows media player opening pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chattycat  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows media player opening pictures</h2>
                    <p>I was using Windows Picture and Fax viewer and loved it.</p>
<p>Couldn't&nbsp; do too much to fix any gliches in a picture but that's what I was used to.</p>
<p>Then tried Windows Live Photo Gallery and like it better, able to fix red eye, straighten the pics. etc.</p>
<p>However when I try open any pictures now, <strong>Windows "media player"</strong> opens and it doesn't seem to be</p>
<p>the proper program to use.for pictures and photos.</p>
<p>However I'm unable to stop it from opening each time I click on a picture.</p>
<p>How can I remedy the situation so media player doesn't open&nbsp;the pictures?</p>
<p>I've noticed when I click to open a picture, it gives me the option to use several different programs</p>
<p>so I went back to Windows Picture and Fax viewer but it doesn't stay in there after closing</p>
<p>How can I fix this problem and make it stay in the unit I want?</p>
<p>I'm really getting frustraited&nbsp;over something that's probably easy to resolve but I don't know how</p>
<p>to&nbsp;fix it. </p>
<p>ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This isn't an Internet Explorer issue, but since you're here...</p>
<p>1. From Start&gt; Settings&gt; Control Panel&gt; Folder Options&gt; File Types, find the relevant file type in the list and select it. Click on Change. Select the program you want&nbsp;as the default. Verify that "Always use the selected program..." is checked. OK your way
 out.</p>
<p>2. Option 2: Right-click the file&gt; Open with&gt; select Choose program&gt; Select the program and check "Always use the selected program..." OK your way out.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

<h2>            ERROR CODE&#58; d000007b</h2>
                    
<p>I turned on my xbox one today and it came up with Error Code: 8b010008 which, as I understand, means that there is problem with xbox live marketplace. I have tried all the suggestions that it has given me but it still doesn't work. I also get Error Code:
 d000007b whenever i click on friends or messages etc. Can someone help me find out what this code means and then we can see whether the two codes are related.</p>
<p>Thanks ;)</p>

<h2>            HP Envy Audio Malfunctioning &#40;w&#47; Test Logs&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I did all kinds of testings and updates of my system audio including troubleshooting my speaker and headphones. It all shows it's functioning properly. It's been a week since this happened, until I did a test by going through the shutdown process, pressing
 Esc to access the audio component test and this is the results</p>

            Hi Julian
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703****09:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            There are some important updates for your system I recommend you apply.
<br />
<br />BIOS Update November 2017
<br /><a href="https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp82001-82500/sp82482.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp82001-82500/sp...</a>
<br />
<br />I noticed the drivers for your model date back to Fall 2013. 
<br />
<br />The problem is likely compatibility related. I noticed the only drivers listed for this model are for Windows 8.1 and earlier versions. This likely means Windows 10 is not compatible with your system.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />In your case, its probably best you downgrade to an earlier version of Windows 10 that works; or reinstall the version of Windows you were running prior to upgrading to Windows 10 (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with Update 1)
<br />
<br />
<br />If you can rollback, try doing that:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-use-the-rollback-function-in-windows-10/3e9e5c2d-239f-488c-9f48-64a226302657">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unable to rollback...
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

</p><blockquote>There are some important updates for your system I recommend you apply.
<br />
<br />
BIOS Update November 2017 <br />

<br />
<br />
I noticed the drivers for your model date back to Fall 2013. <br />
<br />
The problem is likely compatibility related. I noticed the only drivers listed for this model are for Windows 8.1 and earlier versions. This likely means Windows 10 is not compatible with your system.
<br />
<br />
As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback,
 block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC.
<br />
In your case, its probably best you downgrade to an earlier version of Windows 10 that works; or reinstall the version of Windows you were running prior to upgrading to Windows 10 (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with Update 1)
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can rollback, try doing that: <br />
<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-use-the-rollback-function-in-windows-10/3e9e5c2d-239f-488c-9f48-64a226302657">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />
If you are unable to rollback... <br />
<br />
Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br />
<a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />
Choose the following: <br />
<br />
- Windows Final <br />
- Windows 10, version 1803 <br />
- Windows 10 Pro + Home <br />
- English <br />
- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit) <br />
<br />
Step 2: create a bootable copy <br />

Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:
