<h2>            Bluescreen System_service_exception problem when i play games</h2>
                    <p>hello. </p>
<p>i am currently having a problem that is driving me crazy!</p>
<p>Sometimes when i play games, the game stops and says something about unreal engine crashing. i can talk to my friends via teamspeak while this happens, and then it crashes with the system service exception, irql not less or equal.</p>
<p>Or it just instantly goes to a bluescreen and the game doesnt crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was suspecting my asus motherboard or vga software, but i removed both and still got some crashes.</p>
<p>I tried searching for the solution for months!</p>
<p>today i found out about the driver verification tool, </p>
<p>and when i run that with every driver except the microsoft drivers,</p>
<p>i keep getting a bluescreen loop.</p>
<p>I made a few mini dump's, the first one was before the driver verification, the other ones came as soon as i started windows after the driver verification so after 4 or 5 bluescreens, i started in safemode and disabled it again.</p>
<p>is there anything i can do about this?</p>
<p>I know a lot about computers, and normally on other peoples pc's i fix everything! i'm even kind of embarrased that i need to make a post about this.</p>
<p>i dont see an option to upload the dmp and msinfo file here so&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K0lF7AP980kRLzZyKAGQ3MAWxylljiVn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;is a link to my shared google drive with all the files</p>

            Sorry, the MS symbol server is currently having issues which is making the things difficult to analyse.
<br />We would have to start with some generic troubleshooting.
<br />Have you tried reinstalling Nvidia Drivers?
<br />What temperatures is PC currently operating?

            Yes i tried a clean install of the nvidia drivers, the pc is running on normal temperatures. Cpu around 30/40 degrees gpu around 40 idle, and 60 under heavy load so that cant be the problem

            Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:

<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<p><span>Hello stephbond69,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
This is a game that was intended for Windows95 so I don't know if you will be able to install it on a 64bit Vista computer.<br />
<br />
However, you can try a few things.<br />
<br />
From another forum on gaming:<br />

<p><strong><span>Re: Running 32 bit games on 64 bit Vista Ultimate</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<div><span>
<hr />
</span></div>
<p><span>Vista64 has a 32bit compatibility layer so you can run both 64bit and 32bit<br />
apps/games. A few tips for gaming in Vista in general, do not install games<br />
to the default Programs(X86) folder as that is a protected folder and some<br />
older games can't write their save games there, install latest version of<br />
Directx because Vista shipped with Directx10 and is missing a file some<br />
older games need (installing latest version of Directx will put that file<br />
and back in place and not mess up DX10), some games need administrator<br />
access (right click the game exe and select run as admin). Lack of admin<br />
access may be your issue. I have HL2 on Vista64 and it runs fine.</span></p>

<br />
Do you want to do the same thing as in FF?<br />
To drag and drop a url as in FF, but in IE, <br />
just move the cursor to the address bar <br />
arear and click (hold down) the left mouse <br />
button, once the mouse curser is over the IE<br />
file icon (or favicon of that page), you can drag<br />
and drop it as a short cut.

I just drag and dropped a link on my desktop and it became a short<br />

            <p>Backup your files from the control panel items.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;you can find&nbsp;&nbsp; 'file history' ,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; 'windows 7 file recovery'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might also want to search and read up on the&nbsp;&nbsp; RecImg command.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use that dvd you bought when you cant start windows ..&nbsp; there is a Repair link on,&nbsp; I think the first screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; With that disc you don't need to make the Repair disc, but maybe in your users account you might want to use to make a&nbsp; password reset
 dsic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lots of options in the repair function of the disc you have ..&nbsp; go look around on it before you really need it, might be a good&nbsp;thing for you&nbsp;???</p>

I have problems installing windows 7 via USB. <br />
I have made the boot, and been able to install a version i've downloaded, but it will not accept the product-key that I have.

<p>if you bought a laptop that came with Windows 7 Home Premium OEM and you would like to reinstall Windows 7 but have not way of doing so, you can use a retail disc, whether it be a full or upgrade version Windows 7 Home Premium disc.
</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the ‘ENTER’ key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your ‘Country’ from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the ‘Phone Activation’ option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

The version is Windows 7 starter snpc oa.<br />
When I search for it, all I seem to find is some torrents.<br />

Is there any other way, or any version that will work instead`?<br />

            <p>I'm sorry you have been left hanging on. I have no idea why I did not see this reply when you posted it.</p>
<p>I do not know what "snpc" stands for.</p>
<p>Ignore those torrents [you don't know what might be hidden inside them].</p>
<p>To m<span>ake your own Windows 7 installation DVD/USB [4GB USB needed]<span>&nbsp;
</span><em>This is perfectly legal, by the way.</em><span>&nbsp; </span>The USB version is probably the more reliable one purely because of its technology and, in any case, you need a drive that you can then alter to make it suitable for the Windows&nbsp;Starter
 edition that you have.<span>&nbsp; </span>For other versions of Windows this is straightforward but for Windows&nbsp;Starter you have to take an extra step.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First of all, do the normal procedure [see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/usable-download-version-for-usb-installing/Precautionary%20measure%204%20-%20Make%20&amp;%20test%20a%20Windows%207%20SP1%20Installation%20Disk">here</a>]
 but choose another version to download.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do make sure it is a 32 bit&nbsp; or 64 bit version to match what you have [I imagine that Windows Starter is always 32 bit but the checks in the link will confirm this for you].&nbsp;
<em>S</em></span><span><em>o download the Home Premium 32-bit version, for example.</em></span></p>
<p><span>2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then finish making the USB using the procedure given.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then have a look at its contents in Windows explorer, go to the folder Sources on the USB, find the file ei.cfg and delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now complete the test that I have recommended in the link but note that you may find an extra dialog box appears that wants confirmation of the Windows 7 edition and&nbsp;you would select Windows Starter&nbsp;[I have no experience of this and would be grateful
 for your response on this point - this extra dialog might not appear during these simple testing steps but might only appear later on when you were actually using the USB to do an installation].<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please note that deleting that file has made the USB capable of installing other Windows 7 editions but only the Windows&nbsp;edition for which you have the Product Key&nbsp;&amp; Certificate of Authenticity will work for you.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

    <title>WebDAV commands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s. hofmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            WebDAV commands</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone knowledge about reducing the command-set or changing the method for transfering files which windows uses during WebDAV Connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, I've got a problem with Windows and WebDAV. I can connect to the WebDAV Server, can create Files, but can't add Data to them - but carrotDAV on the same machine works like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I used Wireshark, looking for a difference and saw two different approaches on copying or modifying the Files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows uses a PUT, and then a LOG Commnad, the last one fails because of authorization.</p>
<p>CarrotDAV uses PUT also, but no LOG and after creating the file it uses FTP !!Inside!! of the WebDAV request.</p>
<p>Using FTP directly fails...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, has anyone an Idea how to solve the problem?</p>
<p>- WebDAV Server can't be changed. It's a black box of another company</p>
<p>- FTP directly fails</p>
<p>- CarrotDAV works like a charm, but can't be used in command-line</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is a setting in Windows to change this transfer method? Or a way to disable the log-command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english</p>

    <title>Windows 8 - Computer keeps muting itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtompkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 - Computer keeps muting itself</h2>
                    <p>Note: I have an HP Computer, Windows 8, and all windows updates are current.&nbsp; Computer is less then 1 year old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The past few months I have been having major issues where Window's will randomly mute the Audio Sound across all of my sound assets: Normal Speakers and Headphones, and Applications: like Chrome, Go To Meeting, Mozilla Firefox, external speakers, etc. In
 a nut shell, my sounds simply stops working.&nbsp; In opening the Volume mixer, I can click un-mute any/all of the assets in the Volume Mixer,&nbsp; however the sound still does not work. &nbsp; I have tried to replicating the issue, have run malware programs looking for
 a potential virus, tried to un-mute using the volume key on my keyword, have looked for Sound Driver updates, and have searched the Windows community forums (trying to solve the issue), but alas it still seems to keep randomly occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, to solve the issues I need to restart my computer and then all Sounds function fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is becoming a problem because I use this computer for work and Webinar / Conference calls often that require sound functions so that I can hear clients
 questions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem occurs every few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

                    I have an HP EX470 server running WHS2007 that suffered a HD failure after an electrical surge. Could not get anywhere trying to do a recovery. Do not want to do a restore due to 5gb of data on other drives. So I bought an EX490 with a working system drive
 (WHS2007). But then I learned I still had to do a recovery to get it to 'see' my data drives. I've been stuck ever since. 1st it seemed that my disc copy of WHSConnector did not match what was on the system drive. So I downloaded a copy of WHSConnector from
 MS with a matching file date. However I am still not able to get a successful WHSConnector install. Using the Home Server Toolkit it says something about mismatched files, or file dates that do not match. What gives? How do I get at least one of these machines
 up and running? I have spent countless hours fiddling with this and am desperate to get my data available again. My EX470 ran great for years, but now I am in frustration city. Please help! I am not a computer expert, so use

<p>It was working till about a week ago.<br />
Any help will find me grateful!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One reason why the extended mode stopped working can be due to outdated display drivers, recent changes or activities made on the computer before the extended display function stopped working, or a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update your display drivers and monitors from Device Manager &gt; Monitors and Display adapters or run the following automatic troubleshooters:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a></li><li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_performance10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems to help optimize Windows speed and performance</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For hardware isolation, set the other monitor as the main screen and apply the extended mode display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know any significant changes while troubleshooting from one step to another to monitor your progress.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam Vx-800 software does not detect cammera on Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello:<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bits PC and the LifeCam software does not detect the webcam.<br />
<br />
Just purchased a Microsoft LifeCam VX-800 webcam.<br />
<br />
I have tried several "solutions" with no luck including the ones from the Microsoft website.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929087/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929087/en-us</span></a><br />
<br />
I also tried the following with no luck:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Try the following:<br />
<br />
Disconnect and reconnect the LifeCam. <br />
Disconnect other unused USB devices. <br />
Use a different USB port on the computer. If you can, connect to a USB 2.0 port. <br />
If you are using a USB hub, unplug the LifeCam from the hub and plug it directly into your computer.<br />
Restart your computer. <br />
Uninstall, and then reinstall the LifeCam software from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>www.microsoft.com/hardware</span></a>. <br />
<span>www.microsoft.com/hardware</span></a>. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Other webcam applications includying Windows Live Messenger detect the camera and can use it with no problems.<br />
<br />
Orb can stream the camera to my ipod touch as well with no problems.<br />
<br />
The only problem is with the LifeCam software.<br />
<br />
This is so frustrating. I can't believe I'm having a hard time with a simple piece of plug and play hardware.<br />
<br />
Anyone knows what may be going wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h3> newmoonfishing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netgear N900 WNDA4100 USB Wireless Adapter, not working with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install the above adapter to my Dell desktop, I used the manufacturer's installation disk. What happens is initially after connecting the device I will get a brief 1-3 minute period when I can have internet access, then I loose it. ( My router
 is a Cisco unit and I have no issues with any other wifi devices) The product menu window indicates I am still connected but with no internet access. If I disconnect then reconnect at the menu I will once again have internet access for 1-3 minutes. The manufacturer
 is basically useless in their tech support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone here assist me? If you can please be detailed in your step by step instructions I am not that computer literate. If this adapter will not work could somebody please recommend a product that will work without issues.</p>

            <p>ok, my computer was old, had windows xp and somehow or other would not let me use Media player with Overdrive Media any longer to transfer library audiobooks to my Ipod.</p>
<p>so I went and bought another computer, with Windows 8 OS.&nbsp; when I tried to install Overdrive media console, from the library site, I keep getting a message that WMA format is not supported or something.&nbsp; when I clicked on Windows 8 at overdrive I was directed
 to Microsoft.&nbsp; I am probably not making sense, as I am not real computer literate, but I really do not do much&nbsp; with my computer but download audiobooks and play games sometimes.&nbsp; when I try to install Overdrive, I get a box giving the choices "repair Overdrive"
 or "remove Overdrive".&nbsp; I feel like I am going in circles and getting nowhere. I think I am using IE 8, but only got the computer yesterday, so I am still learning it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi <b>JeanNU</b>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for the update. Please refer the information provided below for more on the cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>What music formats does the iPod support?</span></b></p>
<p><span>All iPod models have an upgradable firmware that "enables support for future audio formats" and supported formats have changed over time.
<span>Check with the Apple support team, to know about the formats supported by IPOD.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How can I use music encoded in WMA format with the iPod?</span></b></p>
<p><span>The iPod natively does not support WMA. If you are a Windows user and do not have the music available in another format, you will need to convert it to a format that the iPod can use, such as MP3.

            <p>sir, I am sorry I am unable to make myself clear. I will try to explain again.</p>
<p>the Ipod is not the problem.&nbsp; I think the Windows Media Player is what is giving me the trouble. I was finally able to access the Security Upgrade for Overdrive Media Console, ( all I know is that the libraries use that software in conjunction with Windows
 Media Player to download WMA formatted audiobooks). I have downloaded audiobooks from the library for several years without a problem.&nbsp; suddenly, a few months ago, I started getting error messages about Digital Rights Management and files not found.&nbsp; I could
 not find the answer anywhere and broke down and bought a new computer.&nbsp; I thought my problem would be solved, but I am still in the&nbsp;same boat. first I could not access the Upgrade button, finally got it to come up, ( clicked on refresh, can you believe it?)&nbsp;&nbsp;the
 page says the upgrade is completed,&nbsp;but when I go back&nbsp;to&nbsp;Overdrive Media, I still get the message '&nbsp;unable to acquire license&nbsp;to play the selected title... it requires WMP security upgrade 2.5.0.1 ...2.5.0.0 is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this happens with every audiobook
 I try to borrow.&nbsp; how can I get the upgrade I need?&nbsp;&nbsp; any help would be greatly&nbsp;appreciated!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi jeanNU,</p>
<p>You're not alone. I have the same problem. The DRM security upgrade 2.5.0.1 fails on Windows 8 version of Windows Media Player. The experts here don't have a clue! Nor do I!</p>
<p>I'll continue to search for a solution, and will post back here if I find one. Please do the same if you find a solution..</p>

            hi, Rossellen, I did not think I was in this boat alone. from the questions I have been seeing on the forums, Windows 7 is about as bad.&nbsp; can you connect from the Overdrive Media console, if you use it, to upgrade the security?&nbsp; when I go to 'tools' and
 click on 'Security upgrade for Windows Media Player' I get a box telling me about how I need to upgrade, but when I click "ok" nothing happens. when I go to the upgrade website, the page says upgrade completed, but I still get the same message about only having
 2.0 or whatever component, and needing 2.5 whatever. I am getting so frustrated. all I want to do is listen to my audiobooks.&nbsp;&nbsp; hope one of us finds something soon.&nbsp;

            <p>Hey jeanNU,</p>
<p>I just had success in performing the security upgrade!</p>
<p>I started the Windows Media Player (Run as Administrator), I then started Internet Explorer the same way.&nbsp; Copied
<a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp</a>&nbsp;in to address and the upgrade process completed!!!</p>
<p>Hope you have the same results.&nbsp; I'm not sure both programs need to be started this way, but since it worked I'm not looking back!</p>
<p>See ya</p>

            Rossellen, I am glad for you, afraid I am not getting the same results.&nbsp; sometimes I get the message the upgrade is complete, but go to Overdrive, and get the box stating my security upgrade is not 2.5 something, or else I get the page saying the upgrade
 is complete, then a box pops up saying that the windows media player encountered a problem playing this file. I do not know what file it means or what problem it encountered.&nbsp; still pulling my hair out.

<p><br />
jeanNU, At the point where it indicates upgrade is complete, I think the process has download a Windows Media Player file that when played make the change to WMP.&nbsp; You need to reboot the system, and the change will take effect!!!</p>
<p>Good luck. I need to take care of some honeydo task, so I might not get back until late or tomorrow. I believe after reboot all will be well. By the way, what genre of book do you prefer?</p>

            <p>Rossellen, no, I get a box that says 'Windows Media Player has encountered a problem playing this file'. that is all it says and when I click on 'ok'&nbsp; nothing happens. I have tried restarting and then trying to get the audiobook to go to Overdrive, but it
 still says my security is the out of date number, (can't remember all the numbers). have been consulting with Overdrive as well as looking for solutions on Microsoft. very frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp; to answer your last question, about the only genre I don't like is vampires.&nbsp;
 I like Sci-fi, forensic, mystery, pretty much anything that sounds interesting.</p>
<p>thanks for trying to help me, it is more than I am getting from anyone else.</p>

<p>original title:&nbsp;If I reinstall my Vista, how do I get the backup from an external hard drive? Is it a drag and drop procedure? I am using a Seagate external hard drive and there is no Help section.</p>
<p><strong>I've run the back up on the external hard drive but would like to know how to use it when I reinstall the Vista Home Premium system.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Also, I tried to check the external hard drive for errors and it did not complete the test.</strong></p>

<p>What backup program did you use?&nbsp; That determines what you have to do to get the data from the backup.</p>
<p>Some backup programs store the data in a format that only they can read.&nbsp; In that case, you'd have to re-install the backup program and use it to restore.</p>
<p>Some backup programs store the data as normal Windows folders and files.&nbsp; In that case, you can use drag and drop.</p>
<p>Browse the external disk and see what's on it.&nbsp; Look for folders with "Backup" in their name.</p>

<p>Assuming you used Vista's backup program and did a full backup and not an image backup (though some of these procedures also cover restoring a complete image backup), here is some information to assist you in restoring the data.&nbsp; Try reading or at least
 scanning most of the documents before you begin so you'll get a good understanding of the process and procedures involved.&nbsp; Restoring from an external hard drive is a bit different from restoring from a secondary internal hard drive or CD/DVD or a Flash drive
 or over the network (though fairly close to the network procedure). If you used Vista's backup program, you cannot restore using drag-and-drop - you must use Vista's restore program.</p>
<p><span>Here's an article on the restore procedure:</span><a href="http://www.vista4beginners.com/How-to-restore-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vista4beginners.com/How-to-restore-files</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;just
 to make sure you're doing it right.&nbsp; It's a selective restore of a full or selective backup (not a complete restore of a complete backup) - but since you did a full backup it matches your process closer than a complete restore would.<br />
<br />
This is an EXCELLENT article on the Backup and Restore Process in Vista </span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;but
 it doesn't go into great detail about the restore process - almost considering so easy it's self-evident.&nbsp; But it does teach you a lot about what is possible and how to do it.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It also focuses mostly on the complete backup process but
 it does mention the full backup and restore process as well.<br />
<br />
Here's an article on how to use Advanced Restore (when normal restore doesn't work):</span><a href="http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>I also found the following (but don't know if it's true or not):</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 starting "Backup and Restore Center"</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I
 selected "Advanced Restore"</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I
 wasn't asked for an Administrator password....maybe because my account is an administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Selected
 "Files from a backup made on a different computer"</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Dialog stating "Select the location of the backup to restore", select "Hard disk, CD or DVD......"</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 the drop-down box, select your drive/partition and continue</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 there are any backups on your drive, it will show a list of them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 my case, it did show a backup but in backup location, it will show "Backup location is not available."</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I
 was frustrated but then I somehow just selected that backup(yes....even though it said that the<strong>Backup location is not available"</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>and
 pressed "Next"</span></p>
<p><span><span>11.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Guess
 what....not error!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span><span>12.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>A
 window showed up asking me whether I wanted to perform complete restore or I would like to select specific folders/files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>13.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I
 selected the folders I wanted to restore and bingo...it restored them smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>14.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>So
 next time see an error, try to continue with it..;)</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know if this will help you, but it does provide a lot of information about the process (when it works and even when it doesn't work).<br />
<br />
</span><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>I don't know what you are trying to find out but I'd suggest</p>
<p>1 checking for hardware &amp; software compatibility at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;and running the compatibility checker that you can download from there.</p>
<p>2 checking for hardware &amp; software system compatibility at your PC maker's support site then asking them about upgrade options that they would support</p>
<p>3&nbsp;checking for hardware &amp; software compatibility at the support sites for your additional hardware &amp; software</p>
<p>4 looking at these Windows sites to search for any specific issues of concern <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?LN=en-gb&amp;x=12&amp;y=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://support.microsoft.com/ph/14019#tab0</a></p>
<p>5 looking at Win7 upgrade sellers' websites for any further info they might provide, if applicable.&nbsp; Please note that you should only buy from a source that you can trust for the next three years or more, such as MS themselves or Amazon.&nbsp; Any old crook can&nbsp;give
 you an invalid&nbsp;product key that starts off seeming to be okay but that is then detected as invalid after a day, a week, a month, a year - there are a lot of posts in this forum from users who have been caught out by this criminality&nbsp;and have been left with
 a dodgy system &amp; no valid licence.&nbsp; Whilst you might feel able to trust Amazon itself, you are unlikely to feel as confident about Amazon Marketplace suppliers or eBay suppliers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Best of luck.&nbsp; Win7 is a good OS.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading from Windows Vista:</strong></p>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows
 Vista you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.</p>
<p>If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot
 downgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise</p>
<p>Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>

<strong><b><u>
<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?</p>
<p>Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).</p>
</u></b>
<p>More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files
 you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.</p>
<p>3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.</p>
<p>4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."</p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.</p>
<p>If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

            <p><em>1) How long have you been facing this issue? </em></p>
<p>What's that supposed to mean? Has this mesage been sane in the past? I've NEVER seen ANY version of Windows display a message that says which program exactly to close. I've been using Windows from before the age of USB, so go figure. I haven't skipped a
 single version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2) Is this issue confined to any specific USB device?</em></p>
<p>Again, what's that supposed to mean? Does Windows display the process to terminate for certain types of USB devices, but not for others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to use a 3rd party app to tell me what is still using the USB stick. Not that I can't, but it's just silly. Windows can tell me just fine, I just need Microsoft to bring out an update that tells me WHICH program I should exit in order to eject
 the stick. I don't want to jump through all kinds of hoops to get a fricking USB-stick ejected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How hard can it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not gonna work an I know all programs using the stick are closed, I'll just pull it. But that's not the way to go. Windows CAN know which program is using it, so it SHOULD tell me. The current message looks like I should be the one to start looking
 for clues, as if Windows deliberately hides what it knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, please bring out an update that fixes this message.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply.</p>

</p><p>I can understand your problem but for finding the root cause we request you to try the above mentioned steps and get back to us with the result of the steps. If you don't want to use any third party app then at least try to run security scan, just to check

            <p>Dude, this is not the result of a virus. I understand Microsoft doesn't want to fix this, but here's the thing: this is a stupidity in Windows, not in me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The security scan isn't going to fix the problem, I promise. The "root cause" is a shortcoming in Windows.

<p>
</p><p>It's a bug. That needs. To. Be. FIXED.</p>

            <p>Hello Thanatica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that the error message which you are getting is a know issue but it is not a bug. However, there is a fix available for that which helped lots of people. So, I would request you to try those steps and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click on my computer, select manage<br />
2. Click on disk management tab<br />
3. Left tab (which has probably "disk 1" labelled )on external storage drive(here in your case WD HDD) right click and select "offline"<br />
4.&nbsp;Now from task bar, from USB icon, click and select your WD HDD, it says now "safely remove"</p>

            <p>For the last time then. You need to understand the problem, because you don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is NOT that I can't eject an usb-stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>The problem is that Windows doesn't tell me which program(s) to close when it can't eject the stick just yet. THAT IS ALL.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a message that gets displayed telling me to close any programs that might be using the stick. The problem is that this message doesn't tell WHICH programs I must close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now could you please TRY to read this and TRY to understand, that this is a bug in Windows? PLEASE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's the fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows will give this message:</p>
<p><em>Windows can't currently eject your device because Program X and Program Y are still using it. Try closing those programs and try ejecting your device again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>THAT would be a fix. Now go over to the Windows developers, tell them to implement this fix, then make them deploy it via Windows Update, and then we'll have one less bug in Windows 7. Hooray. How can that be so freaking hard to understand?!</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But seriously, deliberately holding back information that the user NEEDS in order to do what the eject message demands, is a bug to me. One must be a completely moronic monkey to call that a feature (or just lazy to write a few lines of code and deploy it
 along with other bugfixes onto WUP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, Windows Media Player barf (allowed? yes!) is disabled. It doesn't do *anything* on my system. But even if that's the case, fine, then the eject message could say "Windows Media Player is using the device", not be excessively vague as it currently
 is.</p>

    <title>Problems with Surfacebook 2, battery issues and power supply issues... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cisco sid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Surfacebook 2, battery issues and power supply issues...</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Surfacebook 2 15" since it was released in the UK. Ever since purchasing it I have had on and off issues with it and I've contacted Microsoft many times for help. I still haven't managed to get anywhere regarding this issue and I am worried that
 I have a device which I paid a lot of money for that only has an option of being sent off for a repair to Microsoft and risk my otherwise pristine Surfacebook 2 coming back with damage or having it swapped for a "refurbished" unit... Neither of these options
 seems like a good option to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue 1) A month or so after purchase I had an issue where my "SurfaceDTX" application would not appear in the system tray (the app that allows you to detach the Surfacebook), and when it did appear, the icon had a red "x" through it. I contacted a Surface
 support advisor via chat and after a while the problem was temporarily resolved by holding down the power and volume up buttons to boot into UEFI and then continue as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue 2) Then along came another issue a few weeks later, I installed a PC game, only "Diablo 3", nothing intense and was shocked to see that even though my Surfacebook 2 was plugged in and connected to the mains, that my battery life was draining as though
 the laptop doesn't get enough power to supply the graphics card/cpu when under intense loads. This is really bizarre as I've never seen a laptop that requires using the battery power along with AC power to run a task. A lot of people might say, "I think Microsoft
 said that the battery will never completely die" in this scenario, but that isn't the point. It points unwanted charge cycles onto the battery for no reason... mains power should be mains power and the battery shouldn't be being used, regardless of what task
 is being done. If I had known about this issue before buying the laptop, I would never have bought one, lots of other people on forums have mentioned this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue 3) I have noticed that my battery power isn't lasting very long when unplugged and even in battery saver mode with just the OS booting up, nothing else in the system tray. The batteries also seem to be discharging unequally, sometimes with large gaps
 between battery capacity, maybe 20% or even more difference...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue 4) Sometimes my Surfacebook 2 will display something strange in the battery icon section in the system tray. The other week it said that "Battery 1: 100% and fully charged" and "Battery 2: 100% and in use". How is this possible!?!! I've also had occasions
 where the system is plugged into the mains and the slightest move of the laptop will render the AC power useless and it goes into battery mode. I move again and then it recognises AC power again. Very odd! Finally, to make things even stranger, I've also had
 the Surfacebook 2 tell me that "Battery 1: 79% and not charging" while "Battery 2: 42% and in use". I mean, what the heck is going on?! I've contacted Microsoft about this issue and even escalated it because of the amount of issues I've had since day one...
 Microsoft refused to offer a brand new replacement and/or a out of warranty complete refund. In my eyes, this laptop has been defective since day one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is for someone from Microsoft to help me get this item replaced for a brand new one or issuing me with a full refund... is that so difficult, other companies would really be trying to help. All I keep getting told is to contact Surface support...
 trying to get hold of them on the phone is impossible sometimes, they just don't answer or don't understand your issue. I don't want to send this laptop off for a repair and be without a unit for god knows how long... I also don't want to be given a refurbished
 unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else has these issues with their Surfacebook 2 15" and if so, how did you get them resolved? At present, I feel like the only route I have to go down is contacting my credit card issuer, luckily the order was placed using a credit card and I might
 be covered under section 75 of the credit act. But I'd rather Microsoft try and sort this out with me directly... but nothing :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help someone, this is really frustrating and it's such a pity as this is a stunning laptop otherwise!</p>

<h2>            Reregistering BITS modules</h2>
                    <p>When trying to reregister BITS modules I receive the following message for some of them:&nbsp; The module "mshtml.dll" was loaded but the entry point DllResgister Server was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that "mshtml.dll" is a valid Dll or OCX file and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to correct this?</p>

            <p>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did you get the instructions to reregister the BITS modules?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because a file has a .dll extension does not mean it is registerable (sorry Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case you would see this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/daf58fda-0d5f-461e-b2a3-ba03eafd957c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/daf58fda-0d5f-461e-b2a3-ba03eafd957c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for a file to be registerable there must be a function inside called DllRegisterServer and as you can see there is no such thing in mshtml.dll:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b1366e7-a886-4447-809f-833b91429028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b1366e7-a886-4447-809f-833b91429028" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at a DLL that IS registerable like jscript.dll you will see it DOES have the DllRegisterServer function:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/055360f1-49a0-4aa0-b217-cb78ba207f88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/055360f1-49a0-4aa0-b217-cb78ba207f88" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So jscript.dll is registerable and mshtml.dll is not regsiterable and now the error makes sense and is telling you exactly what the problem is - the entry-point DLLRegisterServer was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever instructions you are following are wrong (in this area anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" also like to suggest registering DLLs that cannot be registered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever there is any kind of error message that has ntdll.dll in it the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" always, always, always suggest to register ntdll.dll but it just can't be done for the same reason:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d710f3e-c4fe-412c-80d2-f6d6b78443df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d710f3e-c4fe-412c-80d2-f6d6b78443df" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But they keep doing it...</p>

<h2>            How to create recovery disc in case of a system failure.</h2>
                    <p><span>Original title: </span>Windows 10 Free Upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have successfully upgraded my Windows 7 to 10 with no problems. As I had no hard copy of Win 10 in case I needed to reinstall, I then went to the download page to create a DVD for that purpose. Everything went according to plan and the disk verified
 OK after burning. I then decided to create a USB file in case of problems with the DVD at a crucial time. This went OK except at the very end when a message came up saying “Have your product key to hand” which did not appear when creating a DVD. This is somewhat
 worrying as obviously I do not have a product key as this upgrade was free. I believe that on one of MS web pages I saw that, if you are installing from a USB then withdraw the stick when setup starts to avoid the requirement of a product key. I would appreciate
 if MS can clarify as I cannot be the only one creating recovery media. </span></p>
<p><span>Please not that I have upgraded to Windows 10 and everything is running ok. I am talking about the creation of a recovery disc in case of a system failure.

<h2>            Remarkably slow boot time after updating to Windows 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After updating to Windows 8.1 Pro (64 bit) from Windows 8 Pro, I am experiencing excruciatingly slow boot times.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Earlier the system used to boot up to the start screen within 15 seconds from hitting the power button and shut down within 22 seconds but now it takes between 1 to 1.5 minutes respectively for both start up and shut down.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No hardware configuration has been&nbsp;changed and no apps have been added or removed. What's more, it's a Samsung NP300E5X-A04IN Laptop!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any insights on this would be appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>It's funny cause on my surface rt there seems to be no problem. On my desktop after downloading 8.1 I have also experienced very slow boot times. It's over 3x slower booting up. I just fixed mine by reinstalling windows 8 and not downloading 8.1 until they
 the problem fixed later. It's a shame cause I really like the newer features.</p>

            Same issue. &nbsp;Took 20 seconds to load windows from the time I push the power button on my Dell Inspiron. &nbsp;After updating to 8.1, it takes ~1 minute. &nbsp;I'm happy with the additions 8.1 brought, but this doesn't make me happy at all.

            I'm also very satisfied with the new additions 8.1 brought but I just cannot deal with this issue. Call it a pet peeve&nbsp;if you will but it really bothers me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you something rahzel54.&nbsp;Is it still slow on boot for you? There was an update recently
 for 8.1 on my surface rt, so I'm just wondering if that fixed any of our problems. Don't wanna download it on my desktop if this specific issue hasn't been fixed yet.

            I will give it a try later today and report back.

<div>Something else worth trying is switching to a local account... this seems to have fixed the issue for some, but not for me unfortunately. :(</div>

            <p>Hi, after migrating from 8.0 to 8.1 my Lenovo laptop takes 14 minutes to reboot. I tried several things</p>
<p>1- local login&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- clean boot</p>
<p>3- ran 3rd party software from Lenovo website to check for Software updates, drivers, and specifically to look for issues related to slow restart and boot.</p>
<p>nothing worked, I went from 15 minutes to 14 minutes</p>
<p>The laptop has plenty of memory and capacity. &nbsp;Any suggestion is welcome. Thank you.</p>

<p>Is anyone else having an issue where when starting the Youtube app it constantly locks up the xbox and means you need to hard reset ? Only started happening since the new update but very annoying. My xbox is an original arcade model with a 120gb HDD.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Printing with an old Hewlett Packard printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrl2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing with an old Hewlett Packard printer</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Hewlett Packard DeskJet 670 Tv printer connected to my XP Home machine with service pack 2. This printer works fine, in spite of its age, and design focus for WebTv. I have a special project though in which I want to print many copies of a 4 page
 document. I am having two problems with this.</p>
<p>The document is saved in (and created with) Rich Text, with Microsoft WordPad. I do not have any other word processors installed on this computer. Once this document is open, and I choose to print it, I am wanting to print many copies, or much more than
 just one. Well, when&nbsp;I select print from the File menu, and try to key any number of copies larger than 1,&nbsp;I get a warning dialog which reads:</p>
<p>"This printer cannot support this many copies. Number of copies will be set to printer maximum of 1.".</p>
<p>I click on Okay, and the whole print dialog goes away and I have to start again. I would like to print, at least, 100 copies. How do I key a number larger than 1 that will be accepted?</p>
<p>The second problem is, I also wish to print only certain pages of this document, and in succession, in one print job. Specifically, I would like to print just page&nbsp;1 and page 3, in one job. Well, When I put the bullet in the Pages area in Page Range, and
 key 1,3 and click print, I get a warning dialog that reads:</p>
<p>"You have entered too many page ranges. You may enter a total of 1 page ranges.".</p>
<p>Is it not possible to tell the printer specifically certain pages to print, in just one job-session?</p>
<p>Other than these two issues, I can easily print with this printer. I had already contacted Hewlett Packard tech support, and they pretty much suggest I replace this printer with a newer one. I do not want to replace it&nbsp;when it works just fine in simpler
 situations. Is the issue here, really the printer, or is it my use of the simple processor of WordPad?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have to agree with HP in this regard - replace the printer. All modern printers have a buffer and will keep information about the print jobs in memory. This allows them to print multiple copies, do custom print jobs such as you describe, etc. Your printer
 doesn't have this capability and therefore can't do what you want.</p>
<p>You can get an excellent new printer for very little money which will do what you need.</p>
<p>As an aside, your computer is vulnerable and badly out of date with only Service Pack 2. It needs maintenance and updating.</p>
