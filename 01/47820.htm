<h2>            Copying files VERY slow, speed drops to zero, even on USB 3 -- no solutions have worked</h2>
                    <p>I have a mini PC with Windows 10 64-bit preinstalled. Set it up this weekend and when copying files between USB 3 drives, the speed is abysmal. It fluctuates wildly during copy/move. Rarely more than 10mb/s, and every few seconds it drops to 0 kb/s, where
 it hangs for minutes. Transferring a folder with lots of files can take hours, with most of that time wasted with the process just stalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm copying between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandisk Ultra thumb drive USB 3.0</li><li>Crucial M500 SSD, 960GB - in an Inateck USB 3.0 enclosure optimized for SSD - drive is newly formatted by Win 10, NTFS<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly -- I notice that sometimes when the copy/move stalls, the Windows Explorer status bar on the
<strong>destination</strong> slowly fills with a green progress bar -- and I mean SLOOOWWWLY. It crawls along, and will sometimes get to what looks like 99-100%, then hang. This happens no matter which drive is the destination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched exhaustively and found many forums where this problem is posted and detailed, with almost as many suggested fixes. None have worked for me. Ones I have tried include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>System Maintenance Troubleshooter - no errors</li><li>Optimized the drives for Better Performance</li><li>Autotuning turned off -- no change. Back on -- no change.</li><li>Remote Differential Compression turned OFF for all drives - no change</li><li>Temporarily disabling Win Defender real-time - no change</li><li>Disabled indexing</li><li>Disabled Large Send Offload</li><li>Changed Windows Explorer to open with This PC</li><li>Write caching enabled for all drives</li><li>Tried turning off write cache flushing (box checked) - no change. Back on (box unchecked) - no change.</li><li>Updated the PC's BIOS</li><li>Changing ports on the PC - with/without powered USB hub - no change</li><li>Updated Windows to the latest version - no change</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a speed test, the SSD clocks at almost 500mb/s read &amp; ~300+mb/s write, and the Sandisk thumb drive tests fine as well. But when copying/moving files in Explorer, it maxes around 10mb/s and is most often in kb/s, as I said above. So I assume that,
 like others have posted, this is a Windows issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a complete loss here. I've found a few posts that begin with SOLVED, often using one of the fixes above, but I remain decidedly
<strong>un</strong>solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can provide ANY insight into this, I will be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much!</p>
<p>B</p>

            <p>Actually yes, and I neglected to mention it! I copied a folder from a USB 2.0 WD external drive (in a USB 2.0 port), to the USB 3.0 SSD (in USB 3.0 port). About 5 seconds after the copy began, it ground to a halt at 0 kb/s for over 15 minutes. When it started
 again, it was about 2 mb/s, then stopped at zero again about 30 seconds later. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it going overnight, it was about 700MB and the time was fluctuating with the speed drops but indicated it would take hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it affects all USB ports. And drives. And my patience.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>

            That again involves the target drive connected to a USB 3.0 port. I meant copy/move files directly from the system to a drive connected to a USB 2.0 port. Want to know whether it's an issue only with file operations involving drives connected to USB 3.0
 ports on the system.

            <p>Hi Robert -- sorry, I misunderstood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First -- I mentioned that I left a copy operation in progress overnight -- from the USB3 flash drive to the USB3 SSD. Today I found that it had stopped at 33% and the USB3 SSD had been ejected. This has happened before, and I've seen it on a few posts also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that at the time it failed, it was indicating "More than 1 day" remaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0806934-1b5f-4d62-b433-7dec0c77b1d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0806934-1b5f-4d62-b433-7dec0c77b1d6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now to your question: I copied the same two folders from the system drive to the SSD, once in the USB3 port and once in the USB2 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB3 port:</strong> speed dropped to zero almost immediately; I aborted after 15 minutes of no activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/147a52aa-44d1-47d0-9d55-02887f9d5f6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/147a52aa-44d1-47d0-9d55-02887f9d5f6b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB2 port:</strong> slow speed, and at about 10%, dropped to zero. It fluctuated under 1 mb/s, basically incrementing a couple of times a minute. I aborted that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de5b63ed-5e55-4a2c-8c05-c4525fc5d408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de5b63ed-5e55-4a2c-8c05-c4525fc5d408" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure if that clarifies anything, but thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>Do you experience a similar drastic drop in speeds even if you copy a single large file instead of many small ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was kinda hoping connecting to the USB 2.0 port would result in better behavior. The USB drive getting ejected is even more problematic. There seems to be a serious problem here but not sure whether it's the drivers, hardware or a combination of these
 to blame, or possibly even something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you've updated all your device drivers? Perhaps a different user account will behave normally? Just throwing out ideas...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if booting from a Linux Live USB to check the USB hardware itself makes sense in this case. :/</p>

    <title>Surface Book file transfer slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kent613  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book file transfer slow</h2>
                    <p>I have a refurbished Surface Book (warranty replacement) i5, 128 Gb SSD, 8 Gb RAM. Windows 10 pro. All drivers and software up to date as far as I can tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When transferring files between the laptop and my external hard drive, the transfer is unbelievably slow. The external HDD is a brand new Seagate SRD00F1 4 Tb and the interface is USB 3.0. When using this drive on other USB 3.0 enabled devices, I get transfer
 speeds in the realm of about 80 Mbps. On my Surface Book, it hovers between 30-0 Mbps. The transfer always starts alright and then the speed plummets to maybe 12 Mbps before dropping to 0. Then back to 30, 12, 0. It keeps repeating this cycle over and over,
 stopping after every single file in a multiple file transfer for a solid two minutes before starting the next file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found several people with similar issues digging through various forums but no issues quite like mine.&nbsp; I have tried many of the usual fixes and so far, nothing has made any difference. Please do not tell me to restart my computer or check for updates.
 I'm well beyond that already. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Barcode scanner issue with Remote Desktop and Remote Desktop Application</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Forum Members,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a customer that is using Terminal Server 2012 in combination Windows 10 Pro (1803) desktops and Honeywell Voyager 1602g barcode scanners, when they scan a barcode, they get an error message in the software program they use for stock/storage management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The barcode output should look like this: "D115724" , but when they scan the barcode they get " d115724". We tried different options;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Use the built in Remote Desktop (mstsc) and modify the settings</p>
<p>- Use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Application (Microsoft Store) and modify the settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we use Remote Desktop (mstsc) the barcode works with Capslock activated, but the user have to do this for every barcode and when you are 10/15 meters away from the computer this is a no-go option. We tried to change the keyboard settings to a different
 language (US instead of US International), this seems to fix the problem but they can't type things like é, ë, ö etc. They do use this often so this is also a no-go option.</p>
<p>Remote Desktop (mstsc) seems to work with modified Keyboard settings (Windows-Keyboard combinations option); but they can't use ALT + TAB or other combinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tested the same situation with Windows 7 and the build in Remote Desktop (mstsc) and everything works? It seems to be an issue in the latest Remote Desktop version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else found an option to make this work without losing functions in Remote Desktop?</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;Something happened and we couldn&#39;t make your copy of Windows genuine.&#34; Now I can&#39;t activate Windows and I can&#39;t buy a genuine key.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my computer but my motherboard was having an issue so I had to buy a new one and install that. Now Windows isn't activated and I'm getting the see-through message at the bottom right of the screen that I need to activate it. I
 go to the store to see if I can activate it somehow but I don't have a key anymore. The other option is purchasing Windows 10 to make it genuine, but where it says I can buy it, it just says "Something happened and we couldn't make your copy of Windows genuine."
 Now I can't activate Windows and I can't buy a genuine key.</p>

<h2>            Driver for PCI simple communications controller</h2>
                    Dear Sir<br />
<br />
Since the time I have loaded win 7, (I have win 7 professional, fully updated, core 2 quad 2.40 GHz, 4 GB RAM, 3 internal HDD seagate 1 TB each at 7200 rpm, GE Force nvidia 512 MB VRAM) I have found that the driver PCI simple communications controller is absent
 and it shows an excalmation mark. My system is working fine, I do not have any problems with my system, but i was wondering what is it for . I tried locating the driver from the net, but i have not been able to find it. Could any of you help me about what
 this is, and how do i remove the exclamation mark in the device manager. Just concerned.<br />
Regards<br />

<h2>            &#34;Component &#39;MSCOMCTL.OCX&#39; not correctly registered&#58; file is missing or invalid&#34; error in Windows 10 while trying to run app.</h2>
                    <p>While trying to run a program made for previous Windows versions, I am repeatedly faced with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Component 'MSCOMCTL.OCX' not correctly registered: file is missing or invalid"
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>when trying to run it as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third party program in question is Heaven &amp; Earth, widelly used in SFRPG communities and well recomended, despite being old.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have also tried to run it in compatibility mode (Windows XP (Sevice Pack 3)), but got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already unninstalled, deleted all files, cleared the recycle bin, downloaded the program again and reinstalled it. Same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the MSCOMCTL.OCX file in&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\SystemX86</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it weird because, when searching for a solution on the internet, I have come across experts telling people to look for this file in&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when looking in SysWOW64, i have only found a diferent file with a similar name:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>mscomctl.ocx</strong> (same thing, all minuscules).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what to do next, and am fearful of trying any of the solutions found in forums for similar problems, in case this file is of great importance to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve the error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Eric,<br />
<br />
MSCOMCTL.OCX is an ActiveX Control module that contains common controls used by Windows. To resolve this issue, we suggest following the instructions provided by
<strong>Smittychat</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/component-mscomctlocx-or-one-of-its-dependencies/4ae4dfc4-4a67-4927-990e-489cdb070efb?page=2">thread</a></strong>.
 There are also no difference between MSCOMCTL.OCX and mscomctl.ocx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome. We will be glad to assist you. </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer following Microsoft documentation to first determine which .NET Framework version is installed on your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you identified .NET Framework version installed on the system, you can install a newer version. For example, if you've .NET Framework version 4.6.2 installed, you can install .NET Framework version 4.7 or later but you can't install .NET Framework version
 4.6 on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For .NET Framework version history, please refer following documentation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From above documentation, .NET Framework version 4.7 comes installed with Windows 10 Version 1703. And it can be installed on Windows 10 Version 1607, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.<br />
<br />

    <title>Stutter, Full-Screen, And VSYNC Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward barber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stutter, Full-Screen, And VSYNC Issues</h2>
                    <p>I don’t know how to go about this thing with Windows 10, but for some odd reason, older games seem to stutter and don’t have screen tearing even though VSYNC is turned off. I even checked the games’ settings to make sure it’s also turned off there. I even
 went as far as examining the games’ configuration files to see that no VSYNC is present and I didn’t have this problem on Windows 7 and before. I read that Windows 10 supposedly has triple buffering turned on and that’s why the framerate can go higher than
 the monitor’s refresh rate. Is there a way to force it back to the way it used to be or at least reduce the stuttering at high frame rates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as a side note that there are other issues present in Windows 10 that weren’t there like the window and taskbar being visible in the game even though it’s in full-screen mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are fixes out there, but they seem to bring out the stuttering problem a lot more.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Edward,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>One reason why you are having graphics issues is that the components of your system
 is corrupted or needs to be updated. Here are steps on how to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>trou</span><span>bleshoo</span><span>t</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>video
 and graphics issues:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>1. Determine which version of DirectX is currently on your computer. Click Start,
 and then type dxdiag in the search box. Hit Enter. Under the System tab, make sure that the DirectX Version is DirectX 12.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>2. Check to make sure you are running the latest version of Java. Start the Java app
 (or program) on your computer. Tap or click the Update tab in the Java Control Panel. Then, tap or click Update Now. Solution&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>3. Make sure your computer is properly ventilated. Games use more power than most
 other apps or programs, which generates more heat. Make sure that the computer fan's exhaust vent is not blocked. Solution&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>4. Turn down your graphics and sound settings. Scaling down your graphics and audio
 settings may allow the game to run smoother and be more stable on your computer.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Full Screen Anti-Aliasing (FSAA) – Turning this off or lowering it from the highest
 settings can make a big difference, at the cost of some jagged edges in the graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Resolution – The higher the resolution the harder your graphics processing unit (GPU)
 has to work. Lowering the resolution can have a big impact with fairly little loss in graphic quality. Shadows –<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Simple</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>shadows
 are easier to draw.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Shadows turned off is the easiest of all. Texture/Detail – Lower detail textures aren’t
 as crisp but will make the game easier for your system to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Surround Sound – Disabling surround sound eases the strain on your sound hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lockscreen Showing Wrong Image</h2>
                    After I select the image I would like as a lock screen, the image displayed is not what I have selected. The picture I choose does show in the preview but does not actually show. It seems to show old lock screens that I have had? I am on the picture option
 (not slideshow) and am really confused as to why this is not changing to what I set it to. Please help!

            Hi, kahtrinah
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            your updates are bad and you should feel bad</h2>
                    <p>hi, i just wanted to put it out there that i had my computer on sleep and went to do something for a bit while i had photoshop and an unsaved file open. then my garbage, terrible os started updating. i woke it from sleep, and it was on my lock screen except
 it wouldn't let me in because it was preparing my update, and then my computer proceeds to restart itself. making me lose all my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so in conclusion, the fact that i can't bar my computer from forcing updates on me at the worst possible time is the worst thing ever, and i am convinced you have monkeys with single digit iqs in whichever department thought this was a good idea.</p>

<p>i didn't initially respond to your reply as i had attempted the exact same thing before, and the option to stop the service was greyed out and would not let me click it. so, i assumed windows wanted to lock me out of not having updates because there's an
 absence of salvation in this operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, i right clicked to open the menu like twice, and then it let me stop it. but considering my past with this i doubt i am truly free from the oppression of these forced, useless updates that take ages to download. thanks anyway.</p>

            Hi Malcolm
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />Are you running version 1903 of Windows 10?
<br />
<br />If so, the nightlight issue is a known bug in that update, Microsoft have pushed out an updte that is meant to resolve this on most PC's - KB4501375
<br />
<br />If that is not already installed on your PC, you can manually download and install that update form the Microsoft Catalog page - make sure to download the version fro your PC (generally the x64 version for Windows 10)

            Hello Juliana,
<br />
<br />I’m sorry to say but Microsoft doesn’t provide the option to transfer only OS from HDD to SSD. However I can recommend the workaround. Please do a clean install on SSD. After that SSD will get the active partition. It will also help you to recover your computer if it crashes in the future.
<br />Before you start doing a clean installation make sure you have backups of all the important information you have on the PC. After the clean install you will be able to restore your information on the HDD. 
<br />Please, follow the steps to do a clean install:
<br />Prepare a USB/DVD. Refer to the support article provided by PaulSey. You can also watch a video on this page
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-create-windows-10-installation-dvdusb-flash/8210aa78-9f06-4e60-af0f-bbced92adbb1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />After that please refer to the steps provided by PaulSey in his article on How to Clean Install Windows 10 on a PC Step-by-Step Guide to install the Windows 10 on your SSD.
<br />
<br />Post me back, if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Ipvanish</h2>
                    I am using windows 10 and have ipvanish. I close it down and then try to access the internet without using the vpn via wifi and I get a message saying no internet or limited internet connection although the signal is strong. Can you please advise?

<ol>
<li>Open CMD (Windows Key + R) -&gt; Type CMD -&gt; Press ENTER</li><li>Type without quotes: "ipconfig /release"</li><li>Type without quotes: "ipconfig /flushdns"</li><li>Type without quotes: "ipconfig /renew"</li><li>Type without quotes: "exit"</li></ol>

            <p>Dear ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's Try This Once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete All Available&nbsp; Wireless From System Go To "Manage WIRELESS Networks" In Network And Sharing
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete The Wireless Connection Made To The Router - This Will Trick Your Machine Into Thinking Its Never Connected To The Network .</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Completion This Kindly Restart System Once Than Once Restart Wireless Device Also.
</p>
<p>Than Press Win+R =Run .In Run Box Type ncpa.cpl Than Enter ,Select Wireless Option Right Click Select Connect\Disconnect Option And Check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note : Make Sure Wireless Is ON. If Still Issue Persist Than Reinstalled Wireless Driver As Per System Configuration Or Check With Internet Service Provider Is Internet Access Is ON For You.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            This seems to be a rare case and i wouldn't suggest you to use IPvanish any longer. It seems like the protocols of your windows and the VPN you have selected does not really co-ordinate and you might need to switch your VPN service.&nbsp;<br />
If i may, try <strong>ExpressVPN </strong>for windows 10. <br />
I'm sure it will resolve your issue. I myself got it from <strong>VPNgrades</strong>

            Hi Tiffancy <br />
<br />
I didn't really had a need to try any other protocol. <strong>ExpressVPN </strong>
worked just fine for me since the beginning. <br />
Regarding the quality of PureVPN, I am not sure as my colleagues didn't had a positive experience using PureVPN so
<strong>ExpressVPN </strong>still has an edge over <strong>PureVPN</strong> in my opinion.

            <p>I found a procedure that solved this problem (for me).&nbsp; I've learned that there are several problems that can cause a computer to not shut down.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Try this.&nbsp; It may work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Start] / “My Computer” / “Local Drive (C:)” / “Properties” / “Tools” tab / “Error Checking” / “Check now ...”<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under “Check disk options,” select “<u>Automatically fix file system errors.</u>”<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right click “Start.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a brief period, your computer will ask you if you wish to schedule a disk scan at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Indicate yes.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then force a shut down: [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del].<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Task Master, <u>while pressing [Ctrl] key</u>, right click “Turn Off.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>In a few seconds, your computer will turn off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer at the Power Button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The <u>disk scan will then start and it will take awhile</u>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s progress percentage will be indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When the procedure is complete, Windows will start up normally.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then “Restart” to see if it worked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good Luck.</span></p>

<p>Dude, like 20 people tops play Halo 2 PC online. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure Halo 1 PC has more concurrent players. &nbsp;It's not cost effective to keep the servers open. &nbsp;You can still play on LAN when the servers close. &nbsp;I'd be for keeping the servers open if the game
 actually had people playing, but it just doesn't.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>There doesn't really need to be more DLC, there is tons of custom maps you can play on Halo 2 PC via the servers. Valhalla, Hollow, Guardian, Sol Wars, Boneyard... the list goes on. These maps are awesome and look great.</p>

<p>@JudgeBergan: Not everyone is playing it just for achievements. Many people already have them or don't care about them and just play the game because they enjoy it.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>@UnyoBro: If your favorite online game of many years was announced it was going to be shut off, you wouldn't be emotional about it?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>For me, Xbox LIVE was Halo 2. I would play the game all the time growing up and made so many amazing friends, which to this day there has never been a better online experience. Though I didn't play Halo 2 as much once Halo 3 came out, I still played it every
 now and then. When Xbox LIVE for Original Xbox was announced it was going to be shut off, I played Halo 2 almost every day.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>Then I switched to Halo 2 PC and played it every now and then. Since the announcement was made I have been playing Halo 2 PC a lot more frequently. Before the announcement, there was definitely more than 20 people playing the game. After the announcement
 there are definitely more people online, a lot more.</p>
<p>I think some people didn't realize you could play Halo 2 PC on Windows 7, which is why it became more of a ghost town. By first downloading the Games For Windows Live client, installing it, and then installing Halo 2, the game works great. There's already
 900+ signatures (as of this writing) on the Halo 2 PC petition to keep the game going. It would make sense to shut the game off if Game for Windows LIVE was being shut down, but it's not. Only this game is being singled out, and the way it was announced, at
 the bottom of a long blog post, was just a cold shoulder to the community.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>There have been sequels to Halo 2, but none of them, in my opinion, are as good as Halo 2. The graphics still look great and it brings back a lot of great memories playing this game online still. Halo 2 PC was given an unfair chance, updates stopped a year
 after the game was released, and the marketing and confusion around the game made for a lower installed base.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox acting strange...please help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'll try to be as detailed as I can.&nbsp;My xbox started acting funny last night. I was on it for a while and it was perfectly fine...in a party with friends playing games and everything was fine. Then out of nowhere my game froze...so I turned the game off. Tried to reload it and it froze in the middle of the start up screen before even entering the actual game. Turned it off again and then noticed most things on my dashboard were not loading. Then I was not able to start up any game or app, it was telling me there was an error loading it.<br /><br /> I decided to turn off my console...but it would not turn off, it became unresponsive. I had to do the hard reset. I turned it back on to see if anything would load and it took a very long time to load anything before telling my I had to try and restart again or try troubleshooting for the issue, also recommending going to xboxone/support/startuperror or something along those lines but the site would not load for me. I tried to restart it

            <p>What Kinect hardware do you use? Might it be Kinect for Xbox 360 or Kinect for Windows v1? Then you need the 1.8 SDK
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case try my modified version of that speech recognition sample at <a href="http://SpeechTurtle.codeplex.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://SpeechTurtle.codeplex.com</a> - my version also works without a&nbsp;Kinect plugged in which can be useful to sort out what's happening (if the Speech Runtime is not installed for example then you won't be able to voice control at all with or without Kinect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>also see this article of mine for more links on speech recognition via the respective .NET managed code API:

    <title>Changed wifi&#47;router SSID and password but... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karen gvn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed wifi&#47;router SSID and password but...</h2>
                    <p>My Dell laptop 8.1 is still picking up my old wifi settings. Here are the details:</p>
<p>1) I noticed some unusual activity on my wifi network and decided to change my wifi settings just to be on the safe side</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The old SSID "Ginger" was changed to "Snaps" and the passwords for both the 2.4 and 5 ghz broadcasts were changed as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) To make sure everything was changed successfully, I tested the connection. By plugging my laptop to the back of my router (LAN 1) via my yellow Ethernet cable, I can access the internet but via my OLD connection "Ginger"??</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) When I connect through the Ethernet cable my internet access says "Ginger" when it should be "snaps". &nbsp;Funny thing is I can connect to "snaps" but only wirelessly. I thought once I changed ALL my wifi settings, I should not see the old internet access
 and furthermore should not be able to connect to the internet ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be concerned? If so please help/ advise. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Network name will be set to Ginger which is completely separate to the SSID. The SSID is only used by the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network name can be somewhat obscure as to how to change with domestic routers, sometimes the only way is to completely reset the router. It may adopt the new SSID as the network name eventuallybut because it already has one it may not. The Network Name
 is of little value in a home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally changing the SSID does absolutely nothing to provide additional security. The SSID is normally broadcast and can be seen by anyone in range of the Wireless network so if anyone was using your Wi-Fi then they would at least be able to see the
 change. You can turn off SSID broadcast which would then make changing it of some use but it tends to make creating a connection somewhat unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a relatively basic process for any Wi-Fi hacker to find "hidden" SSIDs so turning off its broadcast is fairly ineffective. In fact it tends to flag up the Wi-Fi network as potentially "interesting" to them. Changing the password is the primary solution,
 preferably with a complex password.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I did hide the broadcast and now (by reading your reply) it's completely ineffective. I'll change it back to broadcast but I absolutely dislike it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed that whenever I "rest/reboot" my router to its default settings, I see a range of wifi networks ready to connect that was not available before the reset. Yes, it's definitely my neighbors wifi but I never see the options until I do the reset
 on my router. Then when I change my settings to the new setup, all of the recently found wifi networks disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my my question is: if my neighbor and I have the same ISP (let's say it's Verizon) can my neighbor access my ROUTER and use it like a hotspot with his/her own settings?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am going to give what is mostly a useless answer Yes and No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, because your router will have been configured with its own Wi-Fi password which will be different to yours so you are locked out of each others. No network is completely immune to hacking and breaking a hidden SSID is easy. Breaking the password is not
 but hidden SSID is sufficiently unusual to make someone think it could be worth trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why yes? I do not know if others do this but BT in the UK have a particular feature in that their router hosts 2 Wi-Fi nets. Your own private one and a separate public one. The two are isolated, one cannot see the others traffic and the private has full
 bandwidth priority over the public. All it requires is when someone connects to the public nets they have to enter their BT account username and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a BT customer I therefore can have access to thousands of Wi-Fi hotspots out and about and by way of a trade off other BT customers can use mine. When that happens I should not seen any bandwidth impact and guest traffic is not counted as mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I change WiFi password from default not because anyone would know it but so I can use a passphrase I can remember.</p>
