<h2>            NumLock Icon on Display Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I would like to remove the NumLock Notification Icon that is displayed on the bottom of my laptop computer display.&nbsp; How to do that in Windows 10.&nbsp; When I just press the NumLock key on the keyboard, the icon toggles activate or inactive (bar across the icon)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the CapsLock icon shows up when I select Caps Lock and then goes away when I deselect it after a few seconds.&nbsp; I would like this feature to be disabled as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you for the assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it did not work.&nbsp; There was no notification for "NumLock".&nbsp; Or something that I could equate to having the NumLock Icon, an up arrow with a number 1 in the middle, in order to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 professional, I use to be able to go into some part of settings and turn it off and on, the same for CapLock.&nbsp; However, I don't know where to do that in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you offer another suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Bump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop does not have an indicator whether caps lock is on or off. Combined with the unpredictability of numlock in Windows 10, this can get rather frustrating. If I need to look for 3rd party options, I will, but I would really prefer to do this natively
 in Windows.</p>
<p>

            Michael, &nbsp;Thank you for your reply but your directions do not address the issue of disabling the on screen icons associated with NumLock that do not ever go away. Could you work through the steps again and re-post with the correct location to disable these
 on-screen icons? &nbsp;Thanks!!

            The posted answers to remove num lock on Lenovo B590, Windows 10 do not work. I have no "properties" in a right-click on taskbar. Spent many hours on this. Only solution not tried is to install a hotkey driver,&nbsp; not my strength. Suspect Microsoft issue
 as this was not a problem when laptop was new. Thanks.

<h2>            HDD led is always ON. Windows is extremely slow&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have a strange problem. My computer is home built and it is running Windows 7 64-bit since 6 months without any problems.</p>
<p>Today and suddenly the HDD led on the computer case is always ON and Windows is extremely slow! I pressed Ctrl+Alt+Del but it did no respond until 5 minutes, the processor usage wasn't high. So I pressed the "reset button". Windows started booting normally
 until the time when there is a black screen and a mouse pointer, the HDD led lights ON again, and windows will finish booting after 10 minutes or so. It is still extremely slow to the extent that it is not usable, also the led is still ON.</p>
<p>What could have caused this problem, and how to fix it?</p>
<p>Your help is very much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Destiny vulture error code fix.</h2>
                    
<p>I have been getting disconnected after playing destiny for about 30-45 minutes. I get the error code "vulture" which bungie forums say the error is due to you not having xbox live gold membership........I have a 1 year subscription!!!!! After i get kicked
 I will log back in, select my character and then it will take me to the planet overview screen and it will keep saying "waiting for party stabilization" then kick me again with the same error.</p>
<p>I have verizon home fusion internet (only thing available) which its nat is set to moderate. Do I need to try to port forward the router or is it another issue?</p>

<p>..........</p>
<p>Hello everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>I knew someone who had this problem before (they don't play Destiny anymore).</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>They fixed it by unpluging the Xbox One from the power outlet for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Please make sure that the Xbox One is&nbsp;off before you unplug it&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One then had to restart itself completely.</p>
<p>The problem was gone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>I hope that this fixes your issues with the " Waiting For Party Stabiliation " message &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>

<h2>            Application Security issue with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I have installed Notepad++&nbsp;using the default installation in C:\Programs Files (x86)\Notepad++ and using a modified installation in D:\Notepad++. The version running from C:\ drive starts without an issue, the version running from D:\ drive gets the
 following error every time I start Notepad++</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This happens with other apps installed on the D:\ as well. Can someone tell me why this is happening? I have set the .exe files to run as administrator and I am logged in as administrator. I installed the applications while logged in as administrator.
 I have read many articles about UAC on the Microsoft site and others but I have found nothing that I can use to fix the problem. Any help would be appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have also tried taking ownership of the Notepad++ files but I still get the above error, the only solution appears to be to inactivate UAC.</span></p>

<p>Do xbox do their own protable hard drive that can hold a bigger amount of data from an external? Just wondering because it might be better to use that rather than my own HDD.</p>

<p>No but you can use a USB drive if you want to. I think it needs to be between 1gb and 16gb and you have to format it on the xbox for it to work.</p>

<p>As others have said you can take your profile to another console via a USB stick but you have to make sure the Xbox that isn't connected to the internet has the system update to make the Xbox acknowledge external USB devices. You may want to bring her console
 to your place at some point to ensure this has been applied.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft ripping off consumers, why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone else noticed this?</p>
<p>XBOX 360 w/o Kinect 4GB - $299</p>
<p>XBOX 360 w/o kinect&nbsp;250GB - $299 (whhhaat?&nbsp; same price?&nbsp; shouldnt 4 gig be cheaper or am i smoking crack?)</p>
<p>XBOX 360 w/Kinnect 250GB - $399 </p>
<p>Kinect by itself as an accessory - $149 </p>
<p>250GB hard drive by itself - $99</p>
<p>So they release the 4 gig system first, then slowly release much needed accessories at higher prices than if you just&nbsp;bought the newer system.&nbsp; This seems criminal to me</p>

<p>Not during the original release. &nbsp;But your right, as of now the 4 gig is going for 199. &nbsp;I was speaking more about the price all of us paid for it the day it released. &nbsp;And microsoft KNEW that they were going to release a bigger Gig months later. &nbsp;I still
 cant play Halo Reach Campaign online bc it requires a bigger hard drive. &nbsp;And Halo is the ONLY game designed by microsoft. &nbsp;There is no coincidence there</p>

<p>They took 50 bucks off of the bundle to give you an incentive to buy it. Seems like basic marketing to me.</p>

<p>perhaps that im just overly angry that i have to buy a new xbox. &nbsp;when i got one right here? &nbsp;My wife wants to play kinect, which i dont have, and i need a bigger hard drive. &nbsp;99 + 149 = nearly 250 just for the two accessories i want, &nbsp;which in itself is

<p>$70 to go watch a movie? &nbsp;Jeez, do you get driven there by limo and get the red carpet treatment upon your arrival?</p>
<p>It's a rubbish analogy anyway as the movies can cost you as much as you're willing to pay and depends on the amount of people you take along with you. &nbsp;So in theory, it's possible to spend thousands on a single night out whether it's going to the movies
 or eating out. &nbsp;Whereas, the price of a console is usually the same in one shop as it is in another.</p>

<p>My GOD Man, what movie theater do you go to?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets see. $12.00&nbsp; for a ticket, $5.00 for a drink, $7.00 for popcorn, $5.00 for a little box of skittles, and lets not forget taxes on the food items. You are looking at $30.00 per person, so if you want to have some relations with the little lady that night,
 double it all up, and it comes close to $70.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Should i be mad at MS for charging $400.00 for my launch 360 that only had a 20 gig HDD? When they KNEW they would be making better ones for cheaper a few months later??&nbsp; Or perhaps i should have waited until the price dropped some more? I guess that
 is the price you pay when you want something now, instead of later.</p>

<h2>            REaltek speakers on Asus laptop emitting weird squeaking sounds after forced Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>This started today after the update installed, well actually as it was installing.&nbsp; I hoped it was part of the install??? but after reboot it is still there, upon trying to watch a video tonight the squeaking sounds are over the audio.&nbsp; This is awful. It
 sounds like weird space music on top of the verbals. Please tell me how to make it stop.&nbsp; I rebooted.&nbsp; My speakers were find before this.</p>

            <p>Find out which Realtek audio chip is being used in your computer (from ASUS support/computer specifications) then download and install the updated driver from Realtek. If by chance ASUS has Windows 10 drivers for your computer hardware you can use those
 instead.</p>

<h2>            Magic Mouse Won&#39;t Pair</h2>
                    <p>I have an Apple Magic Mouse paired with my Dell desktop running Windows 10 and it works flawlessly. I also have a Dell tablet that is paired to a different Magic Mouse that also works very well. For whatever reason, when I attempt to pair a third Magic Mouse
 to my Dell laptop, it pairs for&nbsp;a second, then stops altogether. Another note, my settings app crashes shortly after the mouse stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to&nbsp;uninstall and re-install the Bluetooth drivers for my laptop, and the drivers for my Magic Mouse, and also clean installed Windows 10 -erasing everything. Nothing changes this behavior. This is only repeatable on my laptop. I suspect it's
 a registry value that needs to change, but I don't know where to look and I don't want to muck things up there. No matter what I do, the problem persists. I have no other custom third-party apps running either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, and I hope someone&nbsp;has some insight.</p>

<p>This is NOT a compatibility issue. Since posting this thread, I have resolved to exporting the Bluetooth registry keys from my other desktop Dell computer that works without issue with the Apple Magic Mouse, then importing them into my Dell laptop. I also
 had to turn off power management for the Bluetooth device in Device Manager. The interesting thing to note here is that a flawed registry followed the clean install. I am not sure why or how, but ever since I have imported the good registry keys into my laptop,
 I haven't had the issue I originally reported, and I have a full working Magic Mouse on my Windows 10 machine. I hope this helps anyone experiencing the same issue.</p>

Thanks for your quick reply. &nbsp;Yes, I do have a backup of the Inbox folder containing the .dbx files. &nbsp;It is about 650mb so i know that all my old mail is still there. &nbsp;Is it possible that a recent Microsoft Security Update caused the problem? &nbsp;Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;

            <div>First, check the obvious. View | Current View. Make sure Show All Messages 
is checked and nothing else. If that is not the answer, read on. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The two most common reasons for what you describe is disruption of the 
compacting process, (never touch anything until it's finished), or bloated 
folders. More on that below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why does OE insist on compacting folders when I close it?:<br /><a href="http://www.insideoe.com/faqs/why.htm#compact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/faqs/why.htm#compact</a><br />&nbsp;<br />Why 
Mail Disappears:<br /><a href="http://www.insideoe.com/problems/bugs.htm#mailgone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/problems/bugs.htm#mailgone</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Recovery methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are running XP/SP3, then you should have a backup of your dbx files 
in the Recycle Bin, (or possibly the message store), copied as bak files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first find the 
location of the Message Store.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of 
your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in 
Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In WinXP, the .dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these 
files in Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | 
Control Panel | Folder Options | View.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close OE and then in Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the 
missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later 
once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message 
Store.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* 
same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the 
file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and 
then close OE. If the folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next 
step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there 
is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right 
click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the 
message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the 
message store and open OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the 
old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />If you do not 
have bak copies of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, then:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>DBXpress run in Extract From Disk Mode is the best chance to recover 
messages:<br /><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And see:<br /><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A general warning to help avoid this in the future:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do not archive mail in default OE folders. They will eventually become 
corrupted. Create your own user defined folders for storing mail and move your 
mail to them. Empty Deleted Items folder regularly. Keep user created folders 
under 300MB, and Default folders as empty as is feasible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant 
layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and 
causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and 
has even been responsible for lose of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will 
continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br /><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp; 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And backup often.</div>

<h2>            LifeChat LX-3000 JUG-00013 not working</h2>
                    Hello. For christmas I got one of these Headsets. After the Drivers finished installing I went into the Mixer and it said that there was no audio device installed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72ae4966-5c91-407a-87e2-854851dad960" />
<div>&nbsp;I opened Audacity and It did not recognize the headphones and the mic would not work. I searched Windows update and it said it had the latest version of the driver. I uninstalled the drivers and re-installed them and that also did not work. When I open
 sound properties and set it as the Default Mic and Default speakers, the windows freezes and then after 60 seconds disappears. I ran Malwarebytes and no malware was found, I also ran AVG, same result. Anyone have any Ideas?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I have Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit ans SP1. I have a 3rd-gen intel core i7 and the latest sound drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks in advanced.</div>

Your screenshot shows that you have no Audio device installed. Check in device manager to make sure that is not the case. If it is, go to your computer manufacturer's support website to search for and install the correct driver.<br />

<h3> kirkholm  say:</h3>
<h2>            WWW.TechonSupport.com Scam&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I received a telephone call stating that, from the error messages sent to microsoft from my computer, it had been determined that my computer was infested with malware / trojans. The caller talked me through various 'checks' on my pc and announced that
 I had to connect to his technician who would help me clean up my PC. <br />
At this point I questioned him on which company he represented. He stated his company was TechonSupport.com and that they worked with Microsoft. At this point he was asking me to connect to his technician through the "RUN" access.<br />
I invited him to e-mail me with confirmation of his affiliation to Microsoft and hung up.<br />
Was this a scam to get me to purchase their anti-virus programms? They were very convincing repeatedly mentioning their affiliation with Microsoft / Windows and how badly infected my PC was.<br />

            I've just found your query. <br />
I received a very similar call last week and challenged the caller who immediately hung up. I dialled 1471 (Some UK phones will sometimes store the number of the caller) but the number was not stored.
<br />
I got a second call today and played along with the caller for a while to see what I could discover. After a while the caller hung up again. 1471 revealed that the call came from 001274790083 which seems to be a Bradford, England number, which corresponded
 pretty well with the caller's accent. Checking on the web showed this to be a "suspicious number". I contacted my ISP. The young lady seemed to be interested in the information and said that steps would be taken to circulate the information "appropriately".
<br />
I believe your actions were wise. I fancy that it was more than an attempt to sell you some worthless product. I seem to recall a report that Bradford has a reputation for this sort of thing.<br />
This wasn't what I had in mind, but it may prove informative and amusing: <br />

            Hi I had techonsupport ring me up the week before christmas 2009 to tell me that my PC is running slow he told me to go to prefetch and showed me all of these malicious software, I got taken in by all of this and he got control of my PC and cleaned it,
 then he asks me to go ahead and purchase 2 years service with them and get 24 hours support, I being a fool paid them £110 for 2 years service. 1 week later I get a message from my PC telling me that I have 8 outdated drivers, so I rang techonsupport on the
 number they gave me 01865521065 with the password and username provided and the technician took control of my computer, they rang me back when they had finished telling me that everything is fine now. I replied to him that my screen is blank he told me "not
 to worry" turn your machine off and back on again and it will be fine (RUBBISH) then he hung up. My computer never worked again which cost me over £200 to get another operating system and to clean the machine and re-install the OS. I have

<p>Thanks gents who contributed so far.</p>
<p>I received an unsolicited phone call from Mark at "techonsupport" who suggested he was connected to Windows/Microsoft who had received error messages originating in my PC. Mark, with Asian accent,&nbsp;talked me through directories on my PC which showed it was
 seriously infected. What I apparently needed was to give remote access to their technician so that I could get 1yr/2yr free support and a clean up of my PC. After pressing it transpired that there would be an up front payment. He arranged for me to have a
 six digit number to use to permit remote access.</p>
<p>I told him I would have to make independant enquiries about his company before I would give remote access and would get in touch next week.</p>
<p>He seemed a little upset that I did not immediately go ahead because the access code was costing him.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;correspondance has persuaded me that it is a scam.</p>
<p>Maybe Mark at techon will reply and put us right.</p>
<p>I am using Windows Security Essentials. I hope that this will lead to a warning or block when the techonsupport site is called up.</p>

            I just had 2 calls from TechOnSupport. I was originally sucked in a bit when they said they were working on behalf of Microsoft but stopped when they asked me to go online so they could access my Vaio. I questioned where they were based and they said Oxford,
 they sounded like an India call centre. The guy I spoke to first was JACK DAWSON, from Thailand apparently(!). Today, a JOHN SMITH from TOS called and gave the same speil about error messages and potential threats sent to them from Microsoft. After checking
 out their website and this forum, I asked to speak with JD again. I said that I was liasing with Microsoft (complete bs!) about them sharing my information with TOS and he changed his story to "We have nothing to do with Microsoft!" and said he'd speak with
 JS about saying this to potential customers. I told him that he'd said the exact same thing to me originally where he went on to say that there were two JACK DAWSONS working for TOS.... he then hung up on me when I asked for his manag

<p>This is truly a sad story but all too often true. There are plenty of forums which offer free computer support and tech help. Never believe a scam like that. It's the new form of rogue malware with the exception that it is a live person invading your computer
 rather than malware.</p>

<p>I personally would not rely on Norton to tell me my computer was on. Malicious Removal Tool is ok but only updated once per month. Download and scan with each of the following malware scanners.</p>

            I have today received a call from technical support saying they are working with Ideal world, they have told me that I have a virus on my computor and it is a major one.. I was told to go onto the web site<a href="http://www.globalonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.globalonline</a>...
 when i went onto it it showed up that this was a scam.. so they are on the go again,, I told the caller a foreign person that I was not going to take this any further and that I would ring microsoft&nbsp; he told me to go ahead and do so that he was only trying
 to make it easy for me.. I put the phone down.. I did mention that I used AOL and his reply was to go onto Eol... not convincing that he did not know AOL&nbsp; Please be careful of this one... I rang 1471 but the number had been witheld.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Lumia 950 XL - front facing camera not working - Iris also not working - Build 14376 &#40;June 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am facing a serious issue with my brand new Lumia 950 XL. I got it one week back and all worked. I joined Insider Preview as I did with all my other phone. The front facing camera does not work:</p>
<p>- No respone in photo mode, Screen stays black</p>
<p>- Iris recognition also doesn't work, the sensor turns on the red light, but Screen is dark</p>
<p>The error CodeI get is: 0xA00F4271(0xC00D3704)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before getting back to the latest Standard release I would like to see if there is a way to fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

    <title>How would I know which version of Windows 8 is for a clean - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briansoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            How would I know which version of Windows 8 is for a clean installation&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a desktop computer online that came with no operating system on it, so I bought Windows 8 Pro at Best Buy to install on it. Now, it is up and running, but the product key reads as upgrading and not for a clean installation. And so, I am unable
 to use Windows 8 with its full capability. And Best Buy will not allow me to return the version I bought, because it has been opened.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my question is:</div>
<div>For future reference, how can I tell if the version I bought is for upgrading or for a clean installation? The version I bought just says Windows 8 Pro.</div>
                </div>

            <p>The box should be labeled as an upgrade version and indicate you must have a previous version of Windows to use it.&nbsp; If it only says 8 Pro on the box, it's all you need for a clean install.</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have three of these windows 8 upgrade retail packages, and nowhere do they say UPGRADE in&nbsp;a clear and obvious fashion, like right below Windows&nbsp;8 Pro, which would be an excellent spot...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only place there is a clue is on the UPC sticker in very fine print. Mine says...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WIN PRO 8 32-BIT/64-BIT ENGLISH <strong>VUP</strong> DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also gives the product # X18-08791.... If you were to do a search, you might find that identified as an upgrade, but that's kind of hard to do in a store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back in fine print it mentions "upgrading to win 8", but says nothing about this being an Upgrade Only...</p>

            <p>Hi Briansoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your question about Clean Installation... You can do a "Clean" installation with any version...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the upgrade, you would select "CUSTOM" install and select keep nothing, or even Delete the current partition in "ADVANCED" and install Win 8 to it.</p>
<p>Win 8 will remember what it needs as far as the qualifying license from the original OS goes...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a Full installation, clean install or otherwise, you need the OEM System Builders version.</p>
<p>It comes as either 32 or 64 bit, not both, like the upgrade...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also comes in a blue\purple sleeve instead of a box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might consider calling Microsoft Customer Service and see if they can help out with a proper license.... You probably paid more for the UPGRADE version than what the OEM version would have cost...

            Thank you kindly for your helpful feedback. If it's okay, I just have two other questions.
<div><br />
<div>1 Will I be able to install a fresh installation (not upgrade) on top of the version I already have?</div>
<div><br />
<div>2 With your version, do you have any of these bug issues? I want to figure out if they are caused for not applying an accurate product key, or if they are issues with Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; A. Not able to set an image as a desktop background?</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; B. Automatically logs off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; C. History is not read in Windows File Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; D. While booting back up, ever so often, there is a message saying, "Failure configuring Windows Updates," and it takes a long time to get to the log in screen. The first time, it took 10 minutes. The second time, it took 30.</div>

            <p>That is odd.&nbsp; They usually put a sticker (or in some cases print it on the box itself like that below).&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is odd, and almost a bit unethical IMOP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has been a topic from the very start.</p>
<p>On top of everything else, it seems a lot of sales persons don't know the difference either...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not going to upload an image... just check out websites that sell it, and look at their graphics.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I'm not sure. Do you mean keeping 3rd party stuff you have installed... probably not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would most likely need to start fresh... You can overwrite your current installation with the&nbsp;new</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one if you choose, or delete it in the Advanced section of Custom Install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A. I have no problem, although it took awhile to figure out the process to locate the image I wanted</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. No issues... this may be the result of not being properly activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. I've not paid much attention to that, so I can't say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. I have no such problem... Is this after installing updates, or randomly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be nothing going on at boot concerning updates otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might change your Windows Updates settings to Check and Ask, instead of Automatic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That could possibly be causing a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would consider calling Microsoft, they may just issue you a OEM license, unless that isn't possible.</p>
<p>The only difference is that the OEM has no support from Microsoft, and the Upgrade has 90 days.</p>
        </p>

<p>I took my own advice and checked some of the packaging graphics online...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would seem Microsoft has addressed this issue with it's later shipments....</p>
<p>Some of the graphics now say UPGRADE.</p>
<p>But some of the older images still don't display it.</p>

            <div>@Slance,</div>
<div><br />
1. That settles that then. I didn't know if I could overwrite or delete an operating system.
<div><br />
<div>D. I thought it happened randomly, but I do recall now that updates were being installed after I plugged in a speaker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I do recall having two options when I first started installing Windows 8, although I don't remember if the two names you mentioned matched mine. If I just chose the upgrade option, then maybe I do have the right version after all. But let's just
 make sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>@Shawn,</div>
<div>It appears that it did say that this version of Windows 8 can be for upgrading, but it was written very small on the bottom of the back side. Here are a few pictures of my copy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only difference is, I wasn't using Windows 7, Vista, or XP.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>That's because by default, all retail versions of Windows 8 are upgrades. Only the OEM System Builder license is the full version and it clearly indicates its for installation on a PC without an OS.

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need only one basic Display driver on your computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
I&nbsp;want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important one but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows
 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
