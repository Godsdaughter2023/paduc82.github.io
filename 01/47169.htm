<h2>            Xbox One controller analog stick broken and Help chat is broken on this website</h2>
                    
<p>Controller - left analog stick moves up on its own accord. Have tried all the resolutions and failed. Trying to use warrenty which expires next month for One.&nbsp; The service says for my controller: "Sorry there are no accessories found. Please contact Xbox"</p>
<p>I have the AW One with the controller. I tried contacting the site's instant chat but that thing keeps failing with chat wont initialize.</p>
<p>The controller came with the console which is still under warrenty til November 2015.</p>

<h2>            Access old windows files on slave drive</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Sorry in advance if this is confusing.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So, I had windows 8.1 on my old drive and it got hit with a pretty mean virus. It wouldn't even boot anymore. So I installed 8
 onto a new SSD. Long story short, the computer runs fine now however, all the old windows files are still on the old drive, specifically my music folder which has all of my mp3s on it. And I'm talking 30-40 gigs of music here, not something I can just go get
 again. Plus, with all the old windows folders i'm running out of space on the old drive, which is now acting as a slave (it's a 1tb). I've tried searching multiple ways but to no avail, is there any way i can access all the old files to 1) retrieve my music
 and 2) delete the old windows files I no longer need to free up some much needed space.</span>

            Hi Hermione, are you getting a permissions error trying to access these files?
<br />
<br />If so, click the link below to download a reg file from DropBox
<br />
<br />Once the file downloads, right click it and choose 'Merge', then confirm the merge
<br />
<br />Then in Windows File Explorer, right click any folder and choose 'Take Ownership'
<br />
<br />Let the command run and you will then have full access to the contents of that folder
<br />

            Hi Hermione,
<br />
<br />Say that drive is Drive D, you should find your Files in this location (replace username with your login name):
<br />
<br />D:\Users\username
<br />
<br />Inside that folder you should find your old Music, Documents, Pictures . . . etc. folders, which should contain your files . . .

            Hi Hermione.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First you must run a malware scan on the drive to clean those files if necessary.  Install Malwarebytes  to run a full scan.  Then download and run (from its download) AdwCleaner.  This will clean up the whole PC as needed, but needs to especially clean the slaved drive.
<br />
<br />At that point if possible you can move the data off the drive temporarily to delete it in Disk Management and repartition to get it cleanest of Windows files and boot code.  If not then you can try deleting the Windows folder but it will resist requiring to Take Ownership (using Dave's Shortcut) and also delete some folder's  contents before the folder itself will delete.  So it is faster to move data off to delete the partition in Disk Management and repartition.  
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> xthelancerx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help setting up new user &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I set up a user fine on my main Windows 10 Home PC but on another PC in the house, I can't get it to work just the way I want. I tend to ramble so I am going to highlight my main questions in bold text. I have some background information around it but this
 will just help you figure out exactly what I'm asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The second PC I am trying to setup with my user defaults the user's desktop to C:\Users\Public\Desktop, I want it to default to C:\Users\NewUser\Desktop (NewUser is just the user I am trying to create).</strong> The first PC I set up works just the
 way I want to. I accidentally deleted a ton of stuff from the desktop of the main user (it's a laptop that the family shares, but it is primarily one person's, deleted stuff from their desktop) because I thought I was only deleting it from my user...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help? Also I set up the same user a couple times, I deleted it and set it up again, the folder for the original user is still there under C:\Users. Anyway, let's say the main user's name is JOHN. I made my user, with the hypothetical email, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 and it automatically named the user jondo for the user file, it cut off last letter of email, don't know where it decided to use that name in the first place or why it cut off the last letter, it did this on the first computer. Created the user again, it made
 it jondo.JOHN. Still used the C:\Users\Public desktop so I deleted it again, wasn't just a fluke.
<strong>The user files are still there and it is kind of weird. Why?</strong></p>

What are you actually trying to do? Re-install Windows? There are very few Windows 7 machines that are sold with an installation DVD. All the other ones have a "Factory Restore" mechanism that does not require an installation DVD or a Windows product key. Check
 the laptop manufacturer's home page for details.<br />
<br />
You could use keyfinder.exe (http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder.shtml) to extract the product key from a working Windows installation.<br />

<h2>            MBR2, MBR3, SMBIOS 0x17 &#38; SMBIOS 0x0a BUS 503 errors</h2>
                    <p>Have SuperMicro X10SAT MB, Xeon E3-1275 CPU, 16 MN DDR3 memory &amp; Win 10 Pro 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>Initial HDD was a WD Velociraptor experiencing &nbsp;same issues. &nbsp;Upgraded to Samsumg EVO SDD and performed a fresh install of Win 10.</p>
<p>There did not appear to be any issues until the next day. &nbsp;I believe some Windows upgrades were applied and the problem has resurfaced.</p>
<p>I ran SFC /SCANNOW and no issues were reported.</p>
<p>The PC appears to be simulating proper operation now, however, past experience suggests it will struggle with future Windows updates &amp; will eventually fail to boot up.</p>
<p>I am in the process or recovering the initial load of Win 10 (prior to any updates) and will go through the process of deferring additional updates as long as possible. &nbsp;Just to see if I can isolate the issue to the Windows updates.</p>
<p>I have contacted SuperMicro to see if a BIOS update is available which will correct this issue.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of information regarding the above referenced issues on the internet, end result is someone is trying to sell some 'fixit' software.</p>
<p>Would appreciate suggestions/ideas on how to make these issues go away. &nbsp;We run a small business &amp; the down time is really putting us in a pinch.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>I was solicited by email to give an update and opinion. &nbsp;As indicated above the question was moved to a more appropriate forum. &nbsp;I also posted an update to the TechNet forum as advised. &nbsp;To date,
<p>I will share what I've done, along with my conclusions.</p>
<p>As indicated in my initial post, I was in the process of performing the Win 10 OS in order to initiate a fresh load of the operating system. &nbsp;This was accomplished. I chose to defer all updates until such time as all applications were reinstalled.</p>
<p>The current build # is 1703.</p>
<p>After each software application was installed, I checked the BIOS for MBR errors and performed an incremental backup.</p>
<p>When all the software applications were installed, I checked to see which updates had not been applied. &nbsp;They were listed as:</p>
<p>KB2510065</p>
<p>KB2553371</p>
<p>KB2566445</p>
<p>KB4025342</p>
<p>KB4025376</p>
<p>Each of the identified updates were sequentially installed utilizing the same protocol as used with the application software installations. &nbsp;To date I have encountered none of the issues describe in my initial post. &nbsp;The initial WD Velociraptor HDD was tested
 for bad sectors &amp; none were reported. &nbsp;No issues have popped up with the Samsung SDD, yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deferred updating the BIOS on the PC; awaiting the results of reloading the OS and software applications. &nbsp;In so far as there are presently no issues; the BIOS will not be updated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Information obtained from various searches on the internet seems to suggest the issues I encountered manifest themselves with Microsoft updates (Windows &amp; Office), or, possibly a virus........... hmmm! &nbsp;I won't rule out that possibility ( a virus), but,
 this PC is used in a business environment, not for surfing the net. &nbsp;Emails of a personal nature do not come to this PC or mailbox. &nbsp;And, our virus protection is current. &nbsp;To attribute the weaknesses in the OS or Office applications to a virus seems to me
 to be a 'cop out' for not thoroughly testing the updates prior to release.</p>
<p>Given the amount of information available on the internet devoted to what appears to be a known issue, I am somewhat frustrated the issue was not addressed by this group or the TechNet forum.
</p>
<p>Multiple sources have suggested deferring updates so the quirks can be discovered and corrected. &nbsp;For the time being, this is the route I will take. &nbsp;Yes, I am a little disappointed with Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            NT Authority&#92;System...DCOM Server Process LLauncher Service terminated unexpectantly</h2>
                    I have owned an Acer Aspire One with Windows XP for almost a year. Today I logged on and about every 5 minutes an error message and restart window appears. The message says "This shutdown was initiated by NT Authority\System... DCOM Server Process Launcher
 service terminated unexpectantly." What does this mean and how do I get it to stop? I have tried the my computer properties advanced startup and recovery settings and turned off automatically restart. Does anybody know where I can go from here?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Zappabob: your idea of the start-run-shutdown -a has helped me alot! I only have to see the shutdown error screen once everytime I start my comp now!!!!! Thank you so much for the short-term fix!!!!!

            Same issue here, dell dimension e520&nbsp; Scanned with the following in safe and normal modes, Trend Micro Internet Security, Malwarebytes Anti Malware, SUPERanti Spyware and MS Malicious Software removal tool but it's still happening. I can stop the shutdowns
 by going to&nbsp; -start- -run- then type <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"shutdown -a"</span> then OK but you have to do it each time the shutdown window pops up.<br />
<br />
six hours of scans so far, haven't nailed it yet. any more ideas???<br />

            <p>Hi Ashenta, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to help you!!<br />
</strong><br />
As I understand, you get a runtime error every time you unplug the laptop from its charger.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you could answer a few questions, it would help us resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue occurred?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
3. Do you have Visual C++ installed in your computer?<br />
4. Does this error occur in any other condition?<br />
<br />
These errors can be mostly caused by two factors:<br />
<div>• Software problem. <br />
• Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries are missing.</div>
<div>You may try the following.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Boot to safe mode and check if the issue persists.<br />
<div>Follow the steps to boot to safe mode:<br />
<div>a. Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b. In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c. Click the ‘Boot’ tab.<br />
d. Under ‘Boot Options’, select the ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
e. Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the Safe boot check box:<br />
f. Select ‘Minimal’ and click OK and then restart your PC.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then boo to Safe Mode and place the computer in clean boot state and check if it works.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps to perform clean boot:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1:<br />
<div>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 2: </div>
<div>Enable half of the services<br />
<div>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to step 6.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 7:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Update the ATI drivers.<br />
<div>Follow the steps to update the graphics card driver:<br />
<div>a. Press Windows key + X key and click on Device manager.<br />
b. Search for Display Adapters.<br />
c. Right-click on the graphics card and click on Update driver software.</div>

<h2>            220v Power Supply</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, just unboxed my Xbox One today and I have a quick question. I'm a stationed overseas and am looking for a 220v power supply. I ordered my One off of Amazon so it has a US (120v) power supply. There's potential for this beast to use almost 600w,
 and if I want to leave it on all the time, I definitely don't want to he running it on a transformer! Does anyone know where I can order one? Thanks</p>

<p>There are posts on this issue. If you are from one of "supported" countries, just call the tech support and order one. If not, you will have to use a 600VA stepdown I'm affraid...</p>

<p>The original power supply that comes up with a console bought in the US states that its output is 12V and 17.9A, then 5V and 1A. In total, this feeds the console with up to 12*17.9 + 5*1 = 219.8 watts of power.</p>
<p>This is about the power the console might consume during full load. If a power supply is not capable of delivering it, it may explode, or the console may just shut down during heavy graphics tasks, who knows...</p>
<p>There are some power supplies marked as "Xbox one" on Amazon or Aliexpress, but they do not seem like the original ones. If you magnify some images from the gallery, you can see all of them are (up to this moment) the same, and designed to provide only 135W.
 That is why I would suggest avoiding them.</p>

May be best to PM an official support person if phone support cannot/will not assist you.</p>

    <title>Screenshot Options not Appearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrome beetle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screenshot Options not Appearing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I've really been wanting to take screenshots on consoles for a long time, and when the Xbox One came out with an update to include that in their snap feature, I was really excited. The only problem is, that update seems to have never taken effect for me.
 When I double-tap the xbox button, I can snap apps, but the Y and X buttons for taking screenshots or recording video I'm supposed to be seeing simply aren't there, and hitting those buttons does absolutely nothing. This has frustrated me ever since the update,
 but I only now decided to look into it, and so far I haven't found any other people with the same problem.</p>
<p>The update was applied automatically while I was asleep one night, and now when I got to my system settings it says that my console is up to date. I play games online constantly, so I'm fairly certain that my console is running the same update as everybody
 else. I've tried doing a cold restart, I.E. turning it off in energy saving mode, waiting (much) more than ten seconds so the caches can clear, and starting it up again. No luck. I'm tempted to reset it to factory conditions, but that's a drastic measure I'd
 rather not take just for screenshots, since I have many saved games on it but I have no backup storage device to transfer them to.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar experience?Perhaps there's something obvious I'm overlooking, or a method of restoring updates which I'm unaware of? I'm open to any advice short of taking the console in for repairs, as in my opinion screenshots aren't worth
 the expense of having it looked at by a professional who may or may not know the solution, and will probably charge regardless of whether the problem can be solved. If possible I'd like to find a way to delete the system updates and then re-download them again,&nbsp;<em>without</em>
 losing my saved game data, especially since I share the console with family members who might not appreciate me sacrificing their saves just for screenshots.</p>

<p>Screenshots only work in video-games and not any other apps or the home screen, but I do not know if that is what you are doing. One thing you might have to check is if you have enough space or if you some how have a privacy setting on Game DVR.</p>

<h2>            Print jobs stuck in the Print Queue and will not print on Windows 7 64-bit driver for HP Business Inkjet 2230 printer</h2>
                    I have installed the current HP Universal Printing PCL 5 driver on my Windows 7 64-bit OS.&nbsp; When I try to print a test page on my HP Business Inkjet 2230 printer (USB to parallel cable connection) the job hangs in the print queue.&nbsp; I can run the troubleshooter
 and purge the spooler but then I'm back where I started.&nbsp; The next print command will result in the same error.<br />
<br />
This appears to have also been a problem with Windows Vista (64-bit).&nbsp; Suggestions to remedy the problem are welcomed.

            Hi Chapel by the Sea,<br />
<br />
<br />
Before going in-depth into this issue, I need to collect some information from you, which is important for further troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please briefly describe the environment, including: whether the printer is connecting locally or shared? If it’s shared, which system or device acts as the print server? Is the network wireless or wired?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many computers are involved in this problem? Are the involved computers upgraded from Windows XP to Windows Vista? Or clean install? How long does the problem persists?<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the models of involved printers? Are they using LPT or USB interface?<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the problem only occurs in one computer, have you tested other computers in the same environment? Please also let me know the system information of this computer, especially the model of the motherboard.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hello Eisen,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you have to go through due to this Microsoft .Net Framework installation issue. This issue can be caused if you have disabled the .Net Framework from Windows features or if the .Net Framework components are corrupted.
 Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. How did you uninstall the .Net Framework?</span></p>
<p><span>2. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/10/13/8999004.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which version of .Net Framework was installed on your computer?</a></span></p>
<p><span>3. Which version of .Net Framework have you tried to reinstall?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On Windows 7 we have Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5.1 version, which comes built-in with the Operating System. We can add or remove the feature of 3.5 with SP1 via the Programs and Features/ control panel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hence first, I would suggest you to <strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-windows-features-on-off#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>check the status of the .Net Framework from Windows features</span></a>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the .Net Framework is set to be uncheck, then I would recommend you to check the option and then restart the computer and test the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists then, I would suggest you to <strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>install the latest version of .Net Framework</span></a></span></strong> and test the
 issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the above&nbsp;methods doesn’t help you, then I would suggest you to

    <title>Neverwinter - Bait and Switch - Unacceptable Behavior - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Neverwinter - Bait and Switch - Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
                    
<p>In the Winter of 2015, and January of 2016, specifically, Arc Games released information regarding an update the Xbox version of the game was to receive, that update being the recently released Module 8: Underdark. In the build up to the release of this
 DLC Arc Games presented a series of articles highlighting the changes that would be coming with the release; the PC version of the game, which is one module ahead of the Xbox, received the same exact information prior to their receipt of the same module.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Based on the information released by Arc Games players spent actual money to acquire several in-game digital items and services, namely VIP and Enchanted Keys, so that players could amass an in-game currency called "Tarmalune Bars." According to the documents
 released by Arc Games, these "Tarmalune Bars" could be used to purchase a wide variety of items in the new Trade Bar Store, which would accompany the release of Underdark. Some of these advertised items were high-value items, such as Coalescent Wards and Blood
 Rubies. With particular regard to the former, Coalescent Wards are&nbsp;<em>required</em>&nbsp;to advance certain items within the game and are a key component of character play and development. Aside from a low chance to randomly receive a Coalescent Ward, players
 must purchase them, either with in-game currency or real money. The cost for a Coalescent Ward is $10.00USD--each.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The reveal of the new Market &nbsp;was met generally with praise, as the new price of Coalescent Wards &nbsp;(75 Tarmalune Trade Bars) represented a&nbsp;<em>significant&nbsp;</em>price reduction. The PC received the same developer's notes and the same marketplace when Underdark
 launched on the PC in November, 2015. Because of the large price reduction, and the volume of Tarmalune Bars in circulation, the Blood Rubies and Coalescent Wards were easily the most popular and most anticipated items to be included in the new store.<br />
<br />
The week prior to the release of Underdark, Arc Games and Neverwinter held an Enchanted Key sale; during this sale players purchased keys, which enabled players to gather Tarmalune Bars in advance and anticipation of the new Marketplace.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the day of release, February, 9, 2016, Underdark was released to the Xbox community; the new marketplace was in place, but missing three items: Preservation Wards, Blood Rubies, and Coalescent Wards. In response to the community's outrage--or perhaps in
 anticipation of it (we cannot know)--Arc Games deliberately and intentionally went back to their original developer blogs and altered them to include new language indicating that the expectation XBOX players had of parity between the PC and Xbox version of
 the game was inaccurate, even though no such statement was evident when it was first presented to us. In fact, the copy of the article cached by Google demonstrates the original blog post of January 18, 2016 was indeed intended for an Xbox audience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The tone from Arc Games, since the release of the Tiamat Module in summer of 2015, was that the intended vision of the game was to seek parity between both versions. As such, Xbox players who stay in the loop with Neverwinter were aware--as early as October
 of 2015--that the Tarmalune Trade Bar re-work was coming to the Xbox at a point in the future. At no point, between October until Release Day, did&nbsp;<em>anyone</em> from Arc Games represent that the Xbox community was to receive a substantially different experience
 than what was advertised. In fact, they represented the categorical opposite: parity. Going so far as to include a detailed inventory with prices, which--in light of the dubious and sudden inclusion of a disclaimer--is all the more fraudulent.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Those players--myself included--who paid real, actual money during various sales between October and now, did so with the full understanding and expectation that the Xbox players would be receiving the same content. That understanding was&nbsp;<em>confirmed&nbsp;</em>by
 official release and patch notes--corroborated by parity with the PC version--and then unceremoniously removed without explanation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The period since has been marked a noticeable&nbsp;<em>lack</em> of any communication or assurance on behalf of the Developer. Instead we are told "that they are investigating the situation." They claim their decisions were intentional. That the Trade Bar Store--with
 all of their hype,&nbsp;<em>detailed inventory</em>&nbsp;<em>and price sheets,&nbsp;</em>alleging goals of parity with the PC version of the game, and a lack of any disclaimer prior to release--was all purely hypothetical and not meant to be construed as a statement or promise
 of what was to be delivered to the player.<br />
<br />
Arc Games has defrauded Xbox players across the world. Our version of the game is not as advertised. Perfect World and Arc Games and Cryptic took advantage of Xbox Players. Few things in the world of Neverwinter are actually&nbsp;<em>required</em>. You can get by
 without a lot of things they sell for real money. Coalescent Wards are not optional. When it comes to creating certain items these are&nbsp;<em>required</em> by the game, and the items you create, by extension, are also&nbsp;<em>required&nbsp;</em>in order to meaningfully
 participate later in the game. <br />
<br />
They advertised it; they sold us on it. &nbsp;They got their money in the run up to the release, and then released a different version than advertised, all the while surreptitiously altering their blogs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am deeply disappointed in the developer's behavior, and it does not compare with any of the experiences I've had in 10 years of Xbox Live. This is classic bait-and-switch. Advertise one product, make that product unavailable, and offer an alternative product
 which, in the purchase thereof, enriches the seller directly because of the false advertisement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Please stand by your players; they are feeling overwhelmed by a bully at the moment. Thank you.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hey, guys! I'm very sorry to see the situation, but the offers that developers promote are up to their discretion to change. As you stated, they are already looking into it what their next steps are, and you will want to refer to them for updates. We do not control content within the games themselves unless they were developed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to make sure you know that the cached version you have linked to is showing a snapshot from February 10th, not the 4th, and I am unable to find another version of the the cached site. I only let you know in case you are sharing it other places.</p>
<p>Please do let us know of any changes that happen! Again, sorry to see the frustrations, and we hope Arc works with you guys to an amicable resolution. :)</p>

<br />
For some time now, when I go to Event Viewer, Application and System logs are populated, but nothing shows in Security logs.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I did reset Security Logs to default settings, after clearing out old entries.&nbsp; I left Application and System logs alone.<br />
<br />
Malware?&nbsp; System runs normally, no freezes or hangs.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Registry settings?&nbsp; Administrator settings?<br />
<br />
This is the only thing amiss with this system.<br />
<br />
Recommended course of action?<br />

            I stated the path in my first reply.&nbsp; In gpedit.msc, the path is:<br />
<br />
Local Computer Policy\Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy<br />
<br />
...and inside there are a list of things you can audit.&nbsp; You can enable them on Success, Failure, both, or no auditing at all.&nbsp; Turn all the auditing off and you won't record anything in your log file.<br />
<br />
As the saying goes...&nbsp; "Size doesn't matter..."&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; You can set the size of your log files independently to anything you want to set them to.&nbsp; In the Event Viewer, simply right-click on the "System", "Applicaiton", or "Security" entry in the left column and
 select "Properties".&nbsp; Then tell it how big you want your log file to be before it starts overwriting entries.<br />
<br />
Yes, Windows can open an&nbsp; .evt&nbsp; file.&nbsp; That's what the Event Viewer does.&nbsp; When the Event Viewer is open, simply right-click on "Application", "Security", or "System" in the left-hand column depending on what type of .evt file you want to open and then select
 "Open Log File".&nbsp; It will then give you the opportunity to navigate to that log (.evt) file.<br />
<br />
I don't know what else I can tell you other than to point you to this:<br />
"How to audit user access of files, folders, and printers in Windows XP"<br />
&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310399</a> &gt;<br />
The path they give in step 1 doesn't exist on my machine.&nbsp; I get to it by:<br />
&nbsp; Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Local Security Policy.<br />
or<br />
&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "secpol.msc"<br />

<h2>            Previous Versions tab missing&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, I use to have windows 7 and I would always recover a corrupted file or&nbsp;something&nbsp;through the windows Previous Version's tab and I right clicked on a file and went to properties and that tab is gone! Where did it go? I corrupted a file and now it
 is unusable to me, and I have shadow recovery but the last save was 1/24/13 and doesn't have everything I needed. Where is the Previous Versions or a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;3rd party program?

            Previous versions is gone from Windows 8. Instead, Windows 8 has "File History". Do a google search for "windows 8 file history" and you will find plenty of explanations on how to use it.

    <title>Clicking sound when opening lid of my Surface Book Performance Base - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sophie707  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clicking sound when opening lid of my Surface Book Performance Base</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book with Performance Base, i7, 1TB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the lid of my Surface Book, there is a loud clicking sound, immediately when it comes to a rest position,</p>
<p>The sound appears to be coming from the hinge mechanism, inside the clipboard.</p>
<p>I don't think the sound is that of the screen/clipboard settling on the keyboard base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no sound when closing the lid, only when opening it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book is actually my 2nd - the first one had the same issue, and the tech guy at the Microsoft Store (physical store) thought that my initial Surface Book was a "lemon".</p>
<p>He gave me a new Surface Book, but it makes the same clicking sound when opening the lid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new Surface Book and my previous Surface Book have the same batch number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a clicking sound upon opening the lid normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with a Surface Book Performance base: -open the lid, and let it come to a rest position, is there a clicking sound?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I must admit I didn't think anyone could with certainty say if there is something physically wrong with my Surface Book only based on a word description, and without actually seeing the surface book.<br />
</p>
<p>But I wonder if anyone from Microsoft or anyone who has purchased the Surface Book Performance Base also hears the same clicking sound, when opening the lid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded a video to YouTube, showing the clicking sound when I open the lid of my Surface Book:</p>

            An update...<br />
<br />
I picked up a new Surface Book with Performance Base (different batch number), and this new one has no clicking sound!!<br />
Very happy with that; the clicking was very irritating.<br />
<br />
This new Surface Book isn't "perfect" though.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
During the first few hours of use, I saw the laptop wasn't charging, and the light on the charger was blinking. Just disconnected and re-connected the&nbsp;charger from the connector on the laptop a few times, and now charging seems fine.&nbsp;<br />
Read on an online forum that this is "normal".<br />
<br />
In closing the lid of the laptop, in the last 1/3, there is little rigidity in the hinge, so the lid (clipboard) almost falls on the base as the lid is being&nbsp;closed.&nbsp;<br />
But the good part is that the hinge is more rigid in the upper 2/3 of the rotation; so in the open position, there is less wobble in the clipboard, compared&nbsp;with before.<br />
<br />
There is still this issue of browsers or the desktop freezing when using the Pen for scrolling, but it is less an&nbsp;issue now in Edge.<br />
So Edge has replaced Chrome as my default browser.<br />
<br />
I am going to keep this Surface Book, but I got the 2 year Microsoft warranty.<br />
<br />
Thanks Rizza for your input!
