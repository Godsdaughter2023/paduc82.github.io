    <title>How can I recover a file deleted by CHKDSK&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I recover a file deleted by CHKDSK&#63;</h2>
                    The issue at hand is that I lost two edited pictures which took me about 8-10 hours to make after a Check Disk, and I can't get them back. I already searched through other requests, but my situation is slightly different from what I've read elsewhere.
 I don't have any hidden folder at the root of any partition, and there are no .chk files. (I even tried a computer search with "ext: .chk", and the only files which popped up were in movie maker's folder and could not by recovered by&nbsp;UnChk!)&nbsp;I really need
 those pictures, as they would have to be used on a&nbsp;presentation I'm working on, and I don't have the time&nbsp;to remake them! I tried Recuva too, but it doesn't seem to find them either. Can somebody help me?

Try this:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Copy your picture folder to some other location.</li><li>Right-click the picture folder.</li><li>Left-click "Restore previous version".</li><li>Check if the lost files are visible and readable.</li><li>Review your backup philosophy. Working for 10 hours on a presentation without creating a backup copy on an external medium seems . . . (I leave it to yourself to insert a suitable adjective here).</li></ol>

            I know it's stupid of me...&nbsp;I thought I had a backup but it turned out that I made it prior to the last 2 files (the ones Check Disk deleted). Anyway, the problem is that there aren't any previous versions available. There is also one last fact I forgot
 to mention. You see, I also reinstalled windows recently, and the check disk was made right after it completed the installation and prepared the computer for the first use, so could that be the reason why I don't have restore points? I used to postpone CHKDSK
 as it deleted some of my less important files earlier, but I was away from the PC screen during the windows install and forgot about it. Do you have some more advice? Thank you for your time anyway!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Passwords are saved in one of two places - in &lt;username&gt;.pwl or in a cookie stored on the system. For a web page based password request, you need to find the cookie for the site in question and delete it.
<br />
<br />
For password prompt from IE, go to tools, internet options, content, autocomplete and turn on the option to remember passwords.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Only use this option if you are proficient with PCs, as editing the registry can render your PC useless.&nbsp;
</strong>Deleting the DWORD AskUser in the right hand pane of REGEDIT may help if all else fails.<strong><br />
</strong><br />

<p>Messing with the registry could be messy and cause big trouble.&nbsp; Try this instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>In IE click on Tools &gt; Internet Options </li><li>Click on the Content tab </li><li>In the Autocomplete section, click the settings button. </li><li>Check the box for "user name and passwords on forms"&nbsp; and "Prompt me to save passwords"
</li><li>Click OK on both open windows. </li></ol>
<p>You didn't actually say what passwords you wanted to save, so I'm assuming it's all the millions of passwords various webpages have, and the instructions fix that for Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; If you don't have IE8, I strongly suggest you get it.&nbsp;
<a href="http://update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://<span><span><strong>update</strong>.<strong>microsoft.com</strong></span></span></a></p>
<p>If you don't have, and don't want IE8, I think the older versions have a very similar settings setup, so the directions should help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are wanting to save passwords in something other then on web pages, let me know and I'll detail that.</p>

<h2>            Bad Windows 10 update&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Why does your online technical support team tell me that "I" am responsible for your latest Windows 10 update messing up my new computer's start-up files and that I will have to PAY to have the fault that YOUR UPDATE HAS CAUSED fixed because the fault correction
 is tedious?&nbsp; I have only had the machine 3 days and before your 90 minute update it was running like a sewing machine.&nbsp; The only reason I have this machine was a similar update just about rendered my other new machine so slow it became effectively unusable.
 The only software loaded has been commercially available stuff that I have been using for quite some time - so it is hardly the other parties software. Thank you so much for your kind and considered update and support.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the help - normally I probably would do a restore.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this machine (an Acer Laptop) is only 4 days old and I have only just finished installing my working software (primarily Corel WordPerfect Office and Adobe Framemaker 2015).&nbsp; It isn't the first time this particular update has damaged a machine -
 the same one just about finished off my older machine a couple of month ago - hence the need to buy a new one!&nbsp; None too pleased after having all the "Free" updates fail and forking out nearly £150 for an official new version of WIndows 10 Pro to update (i.e.
 clean install) the old machine, just to have it rendered unusable by an update. My Raspberry Pi 1 is faster than my first Windows 10 machine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some rather worryingly dodgy startups the new laptop appears to be behaving again, although I have lost the graphics off all my Corel WordPerfect Office icons on the big start menu and even a full reinstall doesn't return them. I just get four blank
 squares to work with. I tried everything last time and I now appear to have exactly the same problem this time around.&nbsp; Even completely uninstalling the suite and reinstalling from scratch doesn't work.&nbsp; It seems like this is a "Feature" of the "update" that
 only affects the WordPerfect Office suite icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just find it disturbing that I get exactly the same damage on two separate machines, especially as no other icons get affected.&nbsp; Exactly the same four go.&nbsp; It is annoying as these form a core part of my writing kit.&nbsp; Still, I will just have to learn which
 program is which by their position on the menu screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the official "technical support" I had last night - well, I think I'll revert to Linux before going there again.</p>

</p><p>Support was obtained using link as indicated above.&nbsp; I certainly hope it wasn't someone else as their technical "expert" installed a remote control link as part of the "service". After about half an hour of messing around with command line programs I was
 informed that "I" had messed up the configuration and would have to pay for it to be fixed.&nbsp; Sorry, I don't yet know enough about Windows 10 to even try looking at any config files and I certainly haven't tried anything. The tech support help was directly
 after the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before Microsoft indicated essential update, the machine had been running well for nearly two days. After the update, it had a few hours of very dodgy restarts - even from cold boot.&nbsp; No error codes presented, just very stuttering startups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is annoying is the blanking of my WordPerfect Office Icons (now four blank squares sans icon graphics - exactly as happened on my earlier Windows 10 Pro machine a couple of months ago with what I am assuming was the same maintenance update.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my older machine, performance deteriorated rapidly to the point where it is now just about useless for professional work - which is why I ended up having to buy this laptop.&nbsp; I can't have a Windows 10 Pro machine that runs slower than a Raspberry Pi 1!&nbsp;
 Also very annoyed that all so-called "free" updates from Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 repeatedly failed - I was only able to update my Dell Desktop with a clean install from the full price commercial Windows 10!&nbsp; About £150 for about a months
 worth of use before the last update killed it! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably better not to follow up further - I don't want to waste any more time on this.&nbsp; After all, yesterday's update cost me a night's work on an urgent project.&nbsp; If this machine goes down through updates or hackers I'm going to be moving to Linux.&nbsp; I
 already lost three Apple Mac's to their all singing and dancing (and machine destroying) new recent OS X versions and I originally moved to Apple after Microsoft destroyed my main Windows machine with an old XP update (I was primarily Mac-based for nearly
 8 years as a result of that XP update).&nbsp; Now I am becoming increasingly convinced that the only way to a stable machine is to DIY with Linux - at least the software will be free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your time.</p>

<h2>            Copy of my Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop seems to have some issues and i want to format the hard disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i've lost the copy of Windows 7 that i had, so i will not be able to reload windows. I Dont have a recovery disc because my laptop came with windows vista and i upgraded to (genuine) windows 7 some 3 years ago by downloading it from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I suspect that there is a corrupted file on my Os so i don't think that making a copy of my existing OS will do any good.</p>
<p>Is there any chance to download my own windows7 again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your time and reply.</p>

<h2>            I think my controller is messed up not sure...</h2>
                    
<p>I play alot of FPS shooters like call of duty halo... crysis so on an so forth and recently i've been noticing that my controller
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NO MATTER WHAT SENSITIVITY</span></strong> will no matter what ALWAYS sooooooo slowly turn left like im talking under 1 sensitivity..</p>
<p>On call of duty i play on 7-10 sensitivity and it's pointless because i can't turn left hardly</p>
<p>On reach i play on 4-6 etc but you get the point.... </p>
<p>so im curious is there something wrong with my controller? i've cleaned it and it's not an old controller at all it's one of the new black ones it came with my slim :(</p>
<p>really don't feel like buying a new controller so anything i can do "i've already cleaned it try changed batterys etc"</p>

<p>Well, if only one controller is having an issue, then there's your problem. If it's relatively new, you can return it to the retailer for a replacement, or you can contact phone support about a repair/replacement

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The default screensavers have changed substantially in Windows 7.</p>
<p>There are tons of third party screensavers out there, mostly free. You will need to check to see if any offer that pause or other optional features.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; So I followed those steps to download the EN-CA language pack instead of trying to find it in the ISO from Microsoft Enterprise library.&nbsp; To my surprise even though I asked to download the EN-CA lp, Windows 10 downloaded the EN-GB pack
 instead!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I grabbed the EN-GB lp instead from the ISO and voila, now I can install the EN-CA speech pack on top of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else who is trying to use Cortana in Canada, note that <strong>you need to install the EN-GB lp first, before installing the EN-CA speech pack
</strong>which will enable you to use her.</p>

"Windows Communication Foundation non-HTTP Activation" as a customer service guy from Wizards of the Coast told me to do, the only .net framework that is there is the 3.0.&nbsp; I tried to use this one but it didn't work.&nbsp; I uninstalled 3.5 sp1 and reinstalled it
 multiple times but never shows up. it is in the programs and features part but not the turn windows features on or off list. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Errors with Windows Help and Support, Network Connection, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Errors with Windows Help and Support, Network Connection, and System Restore</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavillion dv6 (4 yrs old), which occasionally overheats with heavy use. Normally I can allow it to cool, restart and carry on. However, my laptop just overheated and shut itself down, and this time I'm encountering all kinds of problems.<br />
First, after restarting, I noticed that the system did not automatically connect to my wireless internet (it does not even recognize the network available).<br />
Second, in attempting to remedy the network issue, I clicked the "Troubleshoot" link, only to receive the following error message, "An unexpected error has occurred. The troubleshooting wizard can't continue" Package ID: Unknown Path: C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\networking&nbsp;
 Error Code: 0x8007045A</p>
<p>Third, since this troubleshooter didn't work, I thought I'd try the Windows Help and Support to search for answers. However, when I opened it, I only received the following message: "Windows Help and Support encountered a problem. You might be able to resolve
 the problem by restarting Windows Help and Support. If the problem persists, try the following: 1. Search for Help online at the Windows website.&nbsp; 2. Contact your computer manufacturer or Microsoft Support for further assistance. There might be a problem with
 one or more Windows system files or folders on your computer." Since I could not connect to the internet, these suggestions/links were pointless.</p>
<p>Fourth, Since I was unsuccessful in locating the problem, I attempted a system restore. However, after it appeared to run (took approx 30 min) and Windows rebooted,&nbsp; the following message appeared: "System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's
 system files and settings were not changed. Details: System Restore could not access a file. This is probably because an anti-virus program is running on the computer. Temporarily disable your antivirus program and retry System Restore. An unspecified error
 occurred during System Restore. (0x80070005)<br />
You can try System Restore again and choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try an advanced recovery method. For more information, see What is Recovery?" I disable my antivirus (AVG), tried again, and received the same
 error. </p>
<p>Short of physically backing up all my files and restoring to factory settings, I feel I've exhausted what I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**EDIT** after scouring this site, I found a suggestion to Run the System File Checker Tool via command prompt (see thread here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/no-internet-connection-on-this-computer-after/83fb22c9-712e-467d-9a68-f8d52dde9bcb),
 which I did, and found a few corrupt files. The following response appeared: " Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them Details are included in the CBS.log... The system file changes will take effect after the next reboot."
 After reboot, the internet connection problem appears to have been resolved. Troubleshooter works. and Windows Help and Support also works!! Hopefully this will help someone else!</p>

            <p>Hi Lorenacadi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing the resolution. Your efforts and patience are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally for the heat issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things inside the laptop generate heat--the power supply (where the power cord plugs in), and the CPU chip.&nbsp; The CPU has a heat-sink and a fan to help disperse this heat and to keep the CPU at a reasonable temperature.&nbsp; The hot air gets sent out the
 vents, and room-temperature air comes in other vents.&nbsp;<br />
What typically happens is dust forms near the vents, near the airways within the laptop that lead to the vents, and on the CPU fan itself.&nbsp; All of these sources of dust cause the air flow to slow down, so that the hot air lingers, and gets even hotter.&nbsp; To
 fix this issue, you'll need to take the laptop apart and "very thoroughly" clean out the dust, and the CPU fan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another potential source of the heat that would compound the dust issue could be software related.&nbsp; The more "work" the CPU has to do, the more energy is required, and as a result more heat is released.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since this is a new system you should have the System maker check it under warranty as<br />
this does sounds like it might be a serious problem with hardware. Drives can go bad in a<br />
day much less in 45 so do not assume its not drive related though I also doubt its the main<br />
cause. Does the system have RAID? Definitely contact the System maker's Support and also<br />
check with their forums (if any) for known issues.<br />

For further troubleshooting these might help.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - Right Click the IDE Controller and Uninstall - then do other<br />
devices that might be affected - when complete - REBOOT</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this will work for all of the windows 10 update issues but it worked for me when my update kept sticking at 99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking through all of the answers from members in community I tried the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click to download the windows update windows recommends that you press run, but&nbsp; I pressed save.&nbsp; Then I opened the folder where the update had downloaded too.&nbsp; Right clicked on the file and Ran as administrator.&nbsp; I then left my laptop and 3 hours
 later came home to seeing the windows 10 welcome screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said earlier I don't know if this will work for all.&nbsp; But if your struggling its worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps everyone out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            It could be a previous bootloader is still the default so F8 is still recognized.&nbsp; Might try running the FIXMBR and FIXBOOT commands, but honestly doing the startup repair should handle that.

<h2>            My xbox one randomly disconnects from xbox live with no leads to why it happened&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I have had this problem for about 4 years now and have not gotten around to fixing it. This is a summary of what happens and what I try to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start up my Xbox and start playing and talking with my friends, then randomly at a random time my Xbox and ONLY my Xbox disconnects from wifi, not my PC that sits right next to my Xbox though, my PC stays connected along with all of my other devices, it's
 only my Xbox One. I have tried several things, resetting my routers configuration to default settings, made sure my PC is not disrupting the signal (which it is not), and have tried resetting the router countless times. I have also tried wondering if my air
 conditioning or any other devices disrupt my Xbox wifi signal, yet there's nothing blocking it. I have very good internet connection from my Xbox to my router. I have no clue to why this happens and I am just trying to find an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help I would like to find an answer as this is REALLY annoying trying to play a game and disconnecting from my wifi losing ALL of my progress.</p>

            Are you able to try a wired connection for a period of time?&nbsp; That would rule out an internet issue, and instead point at a problem with the wi-fi.

            i am unable to try out a wired connection because of where my router is located. I'd like to add that i have moved this xbox to another house and the wifi has no problems. I don't know what is causing ONLY my Xbox to disconnect. And my internet is well
 i have tested its speed on the computer and the xbox they are both very well, this must be a wifi issue im guessing.

<h2>            D-Pad Keeps Skipping Menu Options</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. I'm having an issue with my controller in my social app on my Xbox One. When I go to form a party or invite a friend to a game, the d-pad on the controller skips over menu items and I can't select them. Am I the only one with this problem? How can
 I fix this?</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community<span><br />
<br />
From your issue description, I understand that you want to play Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator WWII on windows 7. Please let me know if you are not facing this issue.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try installing Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator WWII in compatibility mode for Windows XP and see if that help. This is only an attempt but Microsoft cannot guaranty the results.<br />
<br />
Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />

                    <p>Finally I got to the solution...&nbsp;</p><p>1. Login to your microsoft account. Not via the console, but using a browser.</p><p>2. Your info menu in the top menu bar</p><p>3. Upload your billing address regardless of what you added before via console</p><p>4. Restart the cosole</p><p>5.
