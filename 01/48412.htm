            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try using system restore. Insert your Windows 10 disc or bootable USB. (If you don't have a Windows 10 disc, create a bootable USB from a different Windows 10 PC) and follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Change settings from BIOS to boot to either disk or USB. (might require you to check with PC manual on how to access BIOS settings from bootup.</p>
<p>- From WinRE menu, choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; System Restore.</p>
<p>- Let it run and reboot your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If white screen still appears from the start of the process, we might be dealing with a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
        </p>

<p>The best approach for a highly infected PC<br />
is a "Clean Install" as you can never be 100% certain that every last bit of the infections were removed.</p>
<p>That said if you have the time and want to see just how far you can go in removing the viruses, malware and bots then read on.</p>
<p>Start by reading the following Virus Removal Info:<br />
Provided by:&nbsp; Malke - MS MVP:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>For me on a friends PC that had more than 60 infections, and he had no recovery CD and the keycode was lost, the above article 'Malware Bytes','AVG Free' and Norton's NIS 2010 did the trick.</p>
<p>NIS 2010 Trial Software recently released:<br />
<a href="http://shop.symantecstore.com/store/symnahho/en_US/ContentTheme/ThemeID.1313000/pbPage.Trialware_en_US?resid=vyAfXgoBAkgAACCz2K4AAAAQ&amp;rests=1252512234289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shop.symantecstore.com/store/symnahho/en_US/ContentTheme/ThemeID.1313000/pbPage.Trialware_en_US?resid=vyAfXgoBAkgAACCz2K4AAAAQ&amp;rests=1252512234289</a></p>
<p>(Note: The Norton NIS trial download requires a credit card, read the 'Opt Out' terms before you proceed)</p>
<p>AVG Free:<br />
<a href="http://free.avg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a></p>
<p>Plus a second pass using Malware Bytes and NIS appeared to have removed all the infections.<br />

<h2>            Windows Windows 8 nVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2, Other hardware - NVIDIA GeForce 8500 GT - MS update fails</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 8 - Dell Desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Received "Optional Request" to Update to download large - Windows 8 nVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2, Other hardware - NVIDIA GeForce 8500 GT and received failed error 800F0102 (several times now over 3-4 days.&nbsp; No issues with
 graphics when using PC so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) also my Sound Blaster sound system had no sound, after W8 install from W7 - I have to go to the Sound Control Panel and reset to "Default" to get sound back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of weeks, I am having to reset most times - but occasionally it starts up and has sound with no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried finding a driver on Creative Labs but a list of many and not very clear if any one is for W8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Optional updates received from Creative Labs to MS Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) My PC restarts nearly every time after initial start up and say "collecting Info etc" and report Driver Failure see internet! (nothing else) but must be related to the Sound problem as stated in 2)</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the description of the query, it seems like you are unable to install the updates offered from Windows update which are referring to update Windows 8 NVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2 and other hardware - NVIDIA GeForce 8500
 GT graphics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would like really appreciate if you can help me with the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1) Have you installed any security software on the computer?<br />
2) Where do you receive a prompt that the updates have failed? Is it under Windows update history?</div>
<div>3) Are you referring to Optional updates when you say "Optional Request" under Windows update?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to check for the status of the updates under Windows update to know if it has failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to check for the update history:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>However, let’s move ahead and try the following methods to resolve this issue further:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to run Windows update troubleshooter and check if it finds and fixes any error in response to this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter:</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to install the update in clean boot state and check if you are able to install the updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the link below to boot the computer into clean boot state:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>If the issue still occurs, let run system update readiness tool to check if any inconsistencies on the computer is leading to this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To use system update readiness tool on the computer, I would suggest you to refer to the link:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>Follow the section “<strong>For Windows 8</strong>”:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>You need to run the two commands using command prompt provided in the above metioned section to run this tool on Windows 8.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>If the issue still occurs, then I would suggest you to refer to the NVidia website to update the graphics driver and check if it resolves this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can refer to the link to update the graphics driver manually using manufacturer website:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>You can select the model/series of the driver and choose the appropriate operating system to download the driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>For issues related to Sound Blaster sound system:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>For issues on audio devices, such as Sound Blaster, it could be the driver that might be causing this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let’s run the audio troubleshooter and check if it finds and fixes any issue. You can follow the methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to run the audio troubleshooter on the computer:</div>
<div><br />
<div>“No sound in Windows”</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab3&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab3&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to update the latest sound driver by referring to Creative website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here’s the link to update the audio drivers:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you do not find the latest audio driver for the appropriate series of the sound blaster audio system, I would suggest you to download and install the latest audio driver available for Windows 7 compatibility mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the steps to do so:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>

</strong>d) Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the audio driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the steps to install the latest driver that you have downloaded in compatibility mode:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the section “<strong>Apply a compatibility mode</strong>”.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For issue related to error message prompting about driver failure</strong>, I would like to gather few information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the exact/complete error message that you get during initial start up on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since, we are unclear about the certain cause of the error which shows driver failure, I would request you to send us the dump files to get more information on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But, before moving to the steps on how to collect the minidump files, please make sure that minidumps are enabled on the computer.<br />
<br />
<div>You can follow the steps:<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
<div>a) Go to<strong> Start Screen</strong>, type <strong>'sysdm.cpl' </strong>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
b) Under the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, click on the S<strong>tartup and Recovery Settings</strong> button.<br />
c) Ensure that <strong>Automatically restart </strong>is <strong>unchecked.<br />
</strong>d) Under the Write Debugging Information header select <strong>Small memory dump (256 kb</strong>) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
e) Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as <strong>"%systemroot%\Minidump</strong>".
<br />
f) Click on <strong>OK.</strong><br />
g) Reboot the computer if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please follow the steps to copy the contents of minidump files:<br />
<br />
<div>a) Copy the contents of <strong>\Windows\Minidump </strong>to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
b) Zip up the copy.<br />
c) Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
d) Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can refer to the link to know how to send us the minidump files using Skydrive:</div>

            Hi PC Saxon,
<div><br />
Thank you for providing us an update on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
I would gather few more information on this issue:<br />
<div>1) What is the exact model of the Sound Blaster sound system?<br />
2) What are the KB numbers for the optional updates that have failed to install on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you have mentioned that you have installed Norton security software on the computer, I would suggest you to disable security software and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important Note: </strong>Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would also request you to send us the screenshots of the issue showing the details on the failed Windows updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Considering the issue with the Sound Blaster, you can find the appropriate drivers at the Creative Labs website by referring to the exact model or series of the Sound Blaster sound system you use.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can do so using Skydrive. Here’s how to send us the screen shot on Skydrive:</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please reply us with the required information on this issue to help you better.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Feel free to let us know if you need any other issues related to Windows update and we would be more than happy to help you.<br />

            <p>It has never been a good idea to get hardware drivers from Windows Update unless specifically told to do so by the hardware device manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trouble with Windows Update re hardware is that it appears to collect hardware info in much the same way as driver finder utilities do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Ooh look, a SoundBlaster device. We have a driver for them"</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it may not be the driver for your specific SoundBlaster product, maybe for a different hardware revision, and so it invariably fails or causes grief at every reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret when upgrading an OS is not to take the silly minimum recommendations&nbsp;seriously. The biggest issue when upgrading is not the speed of the processor or RAM as long as it is more than 2gb. Driver support is the big issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as a low powered computer gets FULL driver support for ALL of the hardware, it may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be close to&nbsp;a Chess challenge, but it will perform as the maker originally intended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;to your issues.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run with the Windows 8 video driver which installs by default. You can roll back to it by going into Control Panel &gt;&nbsp;Device Manager &gt; Display &gt; and right clicking when there.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you want to see if NVidia have a better driver, go to NVidia driver support..
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound is a tougher issue because it always has been.&nbsp;Still, you should get drivers directly from Creative..
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.creative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.creative.com/</a></p>
<p>If Creative do not have Windows 8 drivers for your soundcard, contact Creative and complain.

            <p>Many thanks to Pinaki and Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did go to the NVidia site and downloaded the driver as you both have suggested a couple of days ago and it has loaded successfully.&nbsp; Although one 3D feature did not but work, &nbsp;I'm running with the 2013 driver, all seems to be okay.&nbsp; AND the Windows - Optional
 NVidia - recommendation has disappeared!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still getting the Driver Failure screen at the beginning of boot-up (thought it had gone away).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will put a copy of the .dmp file&nbsp;on Skydrive - soon as I go through the many steps again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know where the .dmp file is and can see a list of these files daily,&nbsp;can I not just copy these file (say last 5)&nbsp;and put these onto Skydrive and save a lot of steps?&nbsp; They are not large as you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been looking at tool Microsoft provide to interpret the .dmp file but seems a bit complicated. (had to go to another person's blog that explains in simple terms)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure look to getting this sorted - after spending many hours of big time frustration.</p>

<p><font>Hi Everyone,</font></p>
<p><font>When you get your computers functioning stable and Windows update working, here is what I did/do as far as drivers for my system.</font></p>
<p><font>In the past…….. I visited my Laptop’s maker and <strong>many driver</strong> manufacturer sites trying to get updated drivers for my system after I upgraded to Windows 8.
</font></p>
<p><font>I had many mishaps, and I am pretty good at following directions&nbsp; LOL</font></p>
<p><font>I thought the “All in one driver” software must be some kind of scam and avoided it. Finally one day out of desperation I downloaded Driver Update- (after much research).
</font></p>
<p><font>It worked/works perfect! It does everything for me. It pulls from the driver manufacturers, my Laptop Manufacturer and Windows. It also updates my printer that is on the same network.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I really thought it was too good to be true and keep waiting for the crash….never happened!
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was 4 or 5 months ago.</font></p>
<p><font>Maybe it will be a success for your system too. Cost $40.00-$50.00. Do your own research.</font></p>
<p><font>Make sure you don’t let it run in the background with your anti-virus program. Just launch the driver update when needed.</font></p>
<p><font>My experience has always been negative when I have other similar software running with my anti-virus program.</font></p>

            <p>Mishaps upgrading laptop drivers start when going to driver sites other than the computer manufacturer's own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laptop drivers are customized by the computer manufacturers and the individual&nbsp;device manufacturers do not generally release those same drivers&nbsp;on their own websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver&nbsp;finders look for names and models but rarely take into account hardware revisions. I wouldn't recommend use of them, paid or free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering that drivers are provided freely, anybody looking to pay for the privilege of possibly getting into a mess for 'Cost $40.00-$50.00' should seriously look at better ways to spend the cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do your own research.'? I did and this was the first hit.. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What is the exact and complete error cade you get?<br />
<br />
<div>Device Manager displays the following message in the Device Properties dialog box, on the General tab, in the Device Status text box: This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</div>
<div><br />
The issue can be due to the following reason:</div>
<div><br />
Windows cannot load the driver. If the device is a Microsoft 6to4 adapter, the installed network adapter driver may not support the Microsoft 6to4 adapter.</div>
<div><br />
To work on the issue, refer these methods.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
If you see the error code associated with a Microsoft 6to4 Adapter on a computer running Windows 7 in a home environment, you may be able to uninstall the 6to4 adapter to resolve the problem.
<div><br />
To uninstall the 6to4 adapter refer these steps.</div>
<div><br />
a) Press Windows + R,<br />
b) Type ‘<strong>Devmgmt.msc</strong>” without quotes and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
c) The Device Manager will display all installed and “<strong>found</strong>” hardware on the computer.
<br />
d) Find the <strong>Network Adapters Category </strong>and click the <strong>"+" </strong>
to the left.<br />
e) The <strong>Network Adapters </strong>should be listed if installed. Right click the adapter used, select
<strong>Properties</strong><br />
f) Navigate to the <strong>Driver tab </strong>in the <strong>Network Adapter properties</strong>. (6to4 adapter)<br />
g) Selecting the <strong>Uninstall button </strong>will remove the existing driver from the device manager.
<br />
h) Confirm the <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
i) Close <strong>device manager</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
After you perform method 1, run an automated troubleshooting service from Method 2.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
Run the fixit from the following link.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows </strong>

<h2>            I get an error code 80007002 when trying to update Windows.</h2>
                    Updater wont install, gives me said code. &nbsp;Wiping the update cache doesnt work, and i can't update the updater, because the updater is broken. &nbsp;so please, for the love of all things good in this world, don't suggest that unless you can direct me to a MANUAL
 DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL!!!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>second of all. &nbsp;Games for windows live will not update. I get this error code:&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Microsoft.VC90.CRT,version="9.0.21022.8",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",processorArchitecture="x86",type="win32"'. Please refer to Help and Support for more information.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>A similar error code appears, with the same publickeytoken error part and processor architecture when I try to install vcredist_x86 C++2008. &nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled dotnet 4.0. &nbsp;as well as attempted the auto fixer thing. &nbsp;Also, repair
 install produces same error. &nbsp;I have successfully uninstalled the old broken c++2008, but cannot install the latest version. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>All in all, I have spent about 3 to 4 hours trying to fix this, and I have gotten nowhere besides realizing it all seems to revolve around the redist 2008, which I believe can be retrieved through the windows updater. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Sorry if I sound annoyed, but this past 4 hours has been annoying since I have been trying to play Dark Souls: prepare to die edition, and the only thing preventing this has been the stupid games for windows live client. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi there Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply with the update. Based on that error code you received (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/errors/error-code-8007-045d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">4476 0000 3080 0517 8007 045d</a>), its recommended that you remove all
 storage and then re-add your primary storage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your console. </li><li>Remove all console storage devices, including any USB flash drives, any external hard drives, or the internal hard drive on the Xbox 360 console. (See
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add or remove an Xbox 360 Hard Drive</a>.)</li><li>Add your primary storage device; for example, the hard drive.</li><li>Turn on the console.</li><li>Try downloading the update again.</li></ol>
<p>As you've done other troubleshooting so far, I think this may be helpful in getting that update onto your 360 and worth a try.&nbsp; Go ahead and give it another go and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you out a bit more and will be crossing my fingers for you!</p>

    <title>Iphone drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nedh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Iphone drivers</h2>
                    
<p>Hello<br />
<br />
I have read various forums regarding problems with vista and usb not being recognised. I have followed some of them if they related to my situation. The problem i am having is&nbsp;vista not being able to find the drivers for my iphone.
<br />
When i bought the pc with vista pre installed i had no problems all worked and as expected. Iphone showed in itunes and in explorer.<br />
I then installed SP2. Iphone continued to appear in itunes and i had no problem with that but it did not appear in explorer so i can no longer access my photos. I follower some good instructions from this site:<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itprovistahardware/thread/b6c15e75-957a-401f-aecf-80ddf48c5dbe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itprovistahardware/thread/b6c15e75-957a-401f-aecf-80ddf48c5dbe</a><br />
<br />
Before taking this action the device was not recognised and the drivers were not installed. Since taking these actions windows says it finds the drivers but has a problem installing them and the installation fails. It feels like i am almost there but have missed
 something. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be gratefully recieved<br />
<br />
Ned</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Volume control disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanegallant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Volume control disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I've been frustrated by the volume control missing from the taskbar ever since I used custom scaling (110%) so that I could read the letters under the icons on my desktop.&nbsp; (That was another frustration... couldn't just simply increase the icon font size
 slightly.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right clicked on the taskbar,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -scrolled down to, and selected, "Select which icons appear on the taskbar"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -(Note at the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TOP</strong></span> of this window the switch that says, "Always show all icons in the notification area"&nbsp; My preferred setting was on...)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -Then scrolled down to Volume...</p>
<p>I noticed that not only was it on, but it was greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the answer then, was to select that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>TOP</strong></span> switch to "off", make sure all other selections are off, then select "Volume".</p>
<p>When you do this, you will only be able to see 2 icons.</p>
<p>Go ahead and select your second choice.&nbsp; (I prefer Volume and Network.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the icons are there, you just have to press the "^" to see them.&nbsp; (If there not there, then that's a different problem that I don't know about...)</p>

            Yes this is a known bug with Windows 10 Scaling, there is no fix yet coming from Microsoft.

What I have found that works is in the Taskbar Settings, turn off the Volume icon, add a couple of other icons, then turn the volume icon back on so it appears in a different place on the Taskbar . . .

            <p>Apparently, there is no easy way to do this.&nbsp; The attachments and images are stored separately from the message and they are difficult to find.&nbsp; Try going to the Desktop and then File Explorer and navigate to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(substitute [username] with your Windows User name).&nbsp; Then in the right hand search box you can type *.jpg to show all jpg files (other types may be .gif, .png, etc).&nbsp; That should then locate the images and you can copy them to more easily accessible locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to go to Control Panel | Folder Options | View and enable showing hidden files and folders to see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if that works.</p>

            I use Outlook 2007 for email.&nbsp; I&nbsp;found that if I right click the attachment in the preview pane, before I open the email itself, I can click Save As and save the picture or document normally.&nbsp; If I open the email and try to do the same thing it doesn't
 work.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preview pane method works the same way as it use to with an opened email in Outlook 2007 in both XP&nbsp;and Win 7.

            <p>Thanks for this info. I agree it would be better if Windows updated to allow for saving to pictures. But I was able to find these pictures via the path you advised, and you can also Save this search to your favourites. So once set once, I should be able
 to always search for any of these email&nbsp;attachments via this method.</p>

            Hi Hong, Windows 10 natively supports zip files, it can compress and decompress zip files.
<br />
<br />Winzip is not part of Windows 10, it must have been installed alongside some application you installed.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Winzip from Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />Then when you wan to open a zip file, right click it and choose 'Extract All' to use the native Windows functionality . . .

            WinZIP is not developed by Microsoft and is not a freeware, AFAIK. If you do not work with files like RAR, you can use Windows Explorer to create and Extract ZIP files. So you can uninstall it.
<br />Another utility is WinRAR(which supports all compressed formats), which works even after the trial expires-Just it notifies you that evaluation period is expired.

<h2>            How to transfer data between accounts&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've read through a lot of the info here.. but I am still really confused. Especially as to whether I'm changing xbox live or my email account information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, this is what happened:</p>
<p>On my boyfriend's 360 I signed up for xbox live, not knowing I was signed in on his profile. It is now associated with my email and gamertag, and it makes him furious that all his previous game data is now associated with my information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix this, I am in the "dog house" as it were..&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds like you simply bought a subscription on someone else's account. That doesn't affect any Xbox content associated with the account at all. If your boyfriend is concerned about his purchase history he can log into his account at billing.microsoft.com
 to verify it is unchanged. If he is concerned about the associated login/contact information, he needs to go to account.live.com and make sure all of the information listed is correct to his person.</p>
<p>As per your original question, content cannot be transferred between accounts. This includes scenarios where someone signs up for Xbox Live (using their payment info) on someone else's account. The content remains with the original account owner and nothing
 is changed aside from the fact that you just bought them a free month.</p>

<p>Thank you for replying. He did not have an xbox live account prior to my signing up. Then I signed up for xbox gold. All he wants is his game information. I am assuming if I were to give it back to him, I have to pay to have the gamertag changed and change
 the email, which I am having a hard time understanding if it is possible. </p>

<p>Oh okay! So it was just a local account which was then turned into a Live account by setting up Xbox Live? That makes a bit more sense now. Yes, the information on the account can be changed at
<a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>. You'll be able to manage the login email (Aliases), contact information (Security proofs), and general user information from that link. As for changing the Gamertag,
 yes this does cost money. You can do this from the Xbox console itself, this link should help:

<h2>            &#34;This software requires an additional K bytes free....&#34; insufficient disk space error BUT I have free space&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently setup a new PC (built it myself) and am having a strange issue I've never come across trying to install software.</p>
<p>

<p>MSI GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GPU&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\</strong> contains the Windows 7&nbsp;OS and <strong>E:\</strong> is simply used as a storage drive and I'm installing all applications to this drive.&nbsp; I even&nbsp;created a "PROGRAM FILES" and "PROGRAM FILES (x86)" folders on the
<strong>E:\</strong> drive to be used when I install software, I point them to the appropriate folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The issue I'm struggling with is:</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I trying to install some&nbsp;applications I receive an error that reads, "<em>This software requires an additional&nbsp;xxxxxxxxxxx K bytes free on the E: drive.&nbsp; Please remove any unnecessary files and try again.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44bef6b4-a056-42cd-a010-75b335f1f2c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44bef6b4-a056-42cd-a010-75b335f1f2c5" height="213" width="412" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I try it will not allow me to continue installation.&nbsp; Also in this case I am not able to point the installation to another drive folder not that I would want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current application I'm trying to install is a Cubase application update which shows as 27MB so it's nowhere NEAR the free hard drive space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pointed&nbsp;the Windows TEMP and TMP folders to my <strong>J:\</strong> drive which has 2.25TB free space and is used solely for storage.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I've never experienced an issue like this so I somehow feel&nbsp;as though it's got something to do with my Windows OS being installed on my quickly filling
<strong>C:\</strong>&nbsp;SSD drive but all programs being installed onto my <strong>E:\</strong> drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help anyone can offer me would be GREATLY appreciated.&nbsp; I'll try almost anything at this time as I'm considering reinstalling Windows and starting over hoping that will fix this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suspect that re-installing Windows will not help you. The problem is probably caused by older applications whose installation routine cannot handle numbers above 2 TBytes. They get confused and report the ridiculous number you see. Here are a couple of
 ways go work around the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder C:\LegacyApps\App1, or</li><li>Shrink your E: partition by one GByte, then create a new partition F: of one GByte. Create the folder F:\LegacyApps\App1 in it.</li></ul>
<p>In each case you then create a symbolic link in E:\Program Files to the selected folder on drive C: or F:, e.g.
<em>E:\Program Files\App1 -&gt;&nbsp;F:\LegacyApps\App1.&nbsp;</em>Your legacy application will visible on drive E: but the installation program will see the free space of drive F: which should be well within its allowable range.</p>

<p>No, this would be too tedious because you would need to manually create a target folder plus the symbolic link each time. You do this only for the misbehaving applications. This is why the drive F: can be fairly small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not matter if you create the symbolic link in a GUI or from the Command Prompt.</p>

                    <p>After logging into skype.com when I try to buy an extra Skype number there is a message saying that my access to paid features has been limited ( even though all features in my account have been paid and I have had paid features for years ) with a link to
 fix my account, which then goes to an Account Recovery link, which after clicking on that tells me my account is OK and gives me a link to go back to Skype, which then tells me my account needs to be fixed to not have my access to paid features limited.</p>

</p><p>Upon checking the account linked to your community profile, we found out that there are no current restrictions connected with it. Would you mind to try out using a different device or a different internet connection and see if the same error would show
 up when you are to purchase a new Skype Number? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the current connection you are in might have restrictions. Let me know the updates.

No guarantees but the following info may be worth a look:</p>

<br />
Microsoft Windows Explorer no longer<br />
displays thumbnails image previews of<br />

<p>The freeware IrfanView might be worth a try...<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing the software...<br />
open IrfanView and go to...File / Thumbnails...<br />
<br />
On the Thumbnails screen...navigate to the <br />

    <title>Replacement of a defective Xbox One &#38;quot&#59;Elite&#38;quot&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x riddler x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacement of a defective Xbox One &#38;quot&#59;Elite&#38;quot&#59; Controller</h2>
                    
<p>After purchasing the Xbox One Elite controller day one it came out it was great I thought M$ improved on an already great controller. Well 72 days after I had the controller the left thumb stick failed and I could no longer use the controller.<br />
<br />
So what could I do...I sent in the controller to be replaced, paid for shipping, did not have to pay for the replacement due to the controller was still under the 90 day warranty. on 1/22/16 the brand new controller was sent out to me and 4 days later I received
 it, working great...or so I thought at the beginning! 54days later.....JUST 54 DAYS, the left thumb stick fails on me AGAIN, on a NEW controller.<br />
<br />
Here I thought these "Elite" controllers were supposed to be made with metal parts...parts that were stress tested beyond what a player would put on the controller and yet the thumb stick fails AGAIN!<br />
<br />
So what would I do...call into Xbox support again. But wait this time it is a different story. This time I am not going to pay for shipping on a NEW replacement defective controller that was shipped to replace a defective controller. The very nice rep told
 me sure...no problem I will take care of that for you. She set up the order and I made sure before I disconnected from the line that I would receive a shipping label to my email.<br />
<br />
Well sure enough I did not receive a shipping label, so I called back and spoke with another rep, and that other rep told me that the shipping label was sent to the wrong email address. So I gave him the correct email and also another email to send me the label.
 Come 24 hours later still no label. So I called back...again...only to find out oh they can't email a shipping label for a controller(even a 150$ "elite" one) and that I would have to pay for shipping, and the rep canceled the open service order, and promised
 that he would correctly recreate a new service order. I had to call back again next day and find out that rep in fact DID NOT create a new service order.<br />
<br />
At this point I was fed up, requested to speak with a supervisor and they proceeded to inform me that they could not create an order to make it so I wouldn't have to pay for shipping, so I requested to speak with his manager and he promised that I would get
 a call back on the following Monday 3/21/16. Well Monday rolls around no call and I have to call in once more this time I requested a supervisor strait away and got a VERY RUDE supervisor who preceded to tell me that he will not help me and that this NEW controller
 does not come with a NEW warranty.<br />
<br />
Explain that to me how a completely NEW DEVICE does not get a NEW warranty...especially a device that costs 150$! That is HALF of the cost of a NEW Xbox ONE console now!<br />
<br />
So I get fed up with that supervisor and disconnect the call and then call back to get another supervisor for 1 to complain about that other supervisor and 2 to try to get some sort of answers and help to get a defective controller replaced that was sent to
 replace the first defective controller!<br />
<br />
This new supervisor then proceeds to explain to me that I could only have an Xbox "Elite" Controller replaced ONCE! And if that second controller were to say have the left thumb stick fail again, you would be SOL, and you would have to BUY a NEW 150$ "Elite"
 Controller.<br />
<br />
Here is my feedback...you ready for it...THIS IS B.S.! I should not have to buy a NEW controller to replace a DEFECTIVE controller that was sent to me from an Xbox Service Center to replace a DEFECTIVE controller!<br />
<br />
This is despite the fact of having to call back 5 times and be lied to and told misinformation from reps and supervisors! This is terrible service, and only to find out that this is the ONLY place to leave actual feedback or complaints and that even the M$
 corporate number just goes no where.<br />
<br />
Closing thoughts....when did becoming a customer turn into becoming a victim? If I want that I would go to Comcast! And boy oh boy that PS4 is looking better now.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there x Riddler x.</p>
<p>Really sorry to hear about your frustrating experience and any confusion on your controllers ability to be repaired. When you reached out to phone support did they mention they would be reaching back out to you, or was the last call you made the end of the conversation?</p>
<p>If they are still looking into it, let's give it a bit more time for them to reach out to you. If you're still having trouble, please let us know and we can look further into this. Thank you!</p>

<p>Some one did reach out to me by email today, waiting on hearing back from them. However this still persists to be an infuriating struggle to have Xbox replace a defective controller that was sent to replace the first defective controller!</p>
<p>So we will see what comes from this email thread. Not going to hold my breath though!</p>

    <title>Running old games - relive my childhood &#58;P - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> classicvibe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running old games - relive my childhood &#58;P</h2>
                    So, I recently got back into old games that I used to play back when I was in elementary school -
<br />
<br />
Lego Island, and Sim Ant<br />
<br />
Sim Ant was originally designed to run on Windows 3.1x or something (the game came out in 1991) - there is no hope of simply running it on Windows 7, but the emulators I've found online don't seem to do much for it.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />
<br />
As for the Lego Island game, it's not as bad - came out around 1997, and I think it was originally designed for about Windows 95.&nbsp; However, it's still pretty old, and I think some people have had trouble running it on XP&nbsp; (&gt;_&gt;)<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten it yet (ordered online), so I want to know - will I be able to run it?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Island<br />
<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 Home Premium<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You want to look into using <a href="http://www.dosbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DOSBox</a> or other virtual computing like
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS Virtual PC</a> , <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VMware Workstation</a> , or <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sun's VirtualBox</a> . You will need to have a full retail version of the older operating system to install in the virtual machine. There are active user forums for each of those programs and
 you can find out how to create the virtual machines, get sound in Win98, etc. there.<br />
<br />
A good thing to do is look around for "old school" gaming forums where you might get tips about running ancient software. The DOSBox forums are here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://vogons.zetafleet.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://vogons.zetafleet.com/index.php</a>
<br />
<br />
You might also want to check on some of the abandonware sites for forums, how-to's, etc.:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=abandonware&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;oq=abandon&amp;fp=e8d6ef47431c6a4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=abandonware&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;oq=abandon&amp;fp=e8d6ef47431c6a4a</a>
<br />
<br />
And sometimes you just have to experiment. I don't think I'd buy an old game without knowing it would work, though. I've had some good luck running old DOS/Win95 games in a Windows 98 virtual machine (VMware Workstation) but 3D ones like "Grim Fandango" alas
 just will not work.<br />
<br />
Another really great thing for some old games is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Steam</a> . Steam has recently ported over some fabulous old games like "Jedi Knight". I don't know if they will have anything that interests you but I thought I'd mention it.

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp; I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A. </strong>First of all run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if the issue can be fixed. Also install any Windows pending updates. Restart PC for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>B:&nbsp;</strong>If issue persist, visit the&nbsp;link for your PC's make/model and download the chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: If the drivers are for previous version of Windows 10, you may still install the drivers in compatible mode and check. Here's how to:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘<strong>properties</strong>’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>’ and select Windows 7/8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>If your camera can store pictures in more than one location (such as both a disk drive in the camera and a flash memory card), make sure the camera is set to read pictures
 from the location that actually contains the pictures.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>It’s possible that the memory card was accidentally erased or has become damaged. There are programs available that are designed to recover lost pictures from digital
 cameras.</span></p>

<h2>            Excel document pausing between pages while printing</h2>
                    I have an Excel&nbsp;(2002) document spanning multiple tabs that needs to be printed. There are two pages per tab. The printer (Ricoh Aficio MP2550)&nbsp;pauses between each page. This only happens on this type of document (Excel spreadsheet with&nbsp;print area defined)
 I am running XP Professional SP3
