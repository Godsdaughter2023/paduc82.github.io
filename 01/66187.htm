            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are unable to use the imaging device due to the error saying app is used by another app or due to driver configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you to place the computer in a Clean boot state which helps to identify if any third party application is the underlying cause of the issue. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A.</span></span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
</span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now follow the below methods to check if Windows is able to configure the drivers for the imaging device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to f<span>ollow the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the <strong>Hardware and Device </strong>
option from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the <strong>Hardware and Device
</strong>Troubleshooter. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Check for Windows update&nbsp;to look for&nbsp;latest drivers for devices installed in your computer.</p>
<p>Refer to the below Microsoft Help Article on <span><span><strong>Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong>, written by one of our MVPs,
<strong>Andre da Costa.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Additionally, I would also suggest you to refer to the manufacturer/computer assembler's website to look for updated drivers for your device.</span></p>

    <title>16GB Win10 Tablet doesnt have enough storage to do essential updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aj  h.pronounced ayejaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            16GB Win10 Tablet doesnt have enough storage to do essential updates i.e. 1511 Cortana etc</h2>
                    <p>My small Widows10 tablet Only has&nbsp; a maximum 16GB pre-installed&nbsp;for&nbsp;use, and an 32GB micro SD card also it's maximum allowable&nbsp;Card size and definitely no higher... I am desperate for someone who&nbsp;really knows about the advice I am seeking.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you are reading
 this now, this is my first question of most value to me and my nice little windows 10 tablet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Can I merge&nbsp;my 32GB&nbsp;SD Card with the 16GB C: Drive for more storage? Just that &nbsp;I have had to reformat it quite a few times now from attempt to attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding
 nothing in the build and removing apps&nbsp;unnecessary etc. has had no benefits in being able to do the necessary updates like 1511 (Cortana).&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing that I should be able to merge both the 16GB hard drive with the 32GB SD Card into 1 partition, without
 harming any performance or apps from working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reformatting several times, I am not winning. The space needed when it keeps trying to update and smaller updates prior, keep blocking me from continuing. When the first format was done the hard drive needed an additional 12GB's + or-&nbsp;something GB's
 and on my last attempt I got it down to only wanting an extra 4GB = or -. somethings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these examples, I certainly would have had no space left anyhow, in order to continue on enjoying the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet even though labelled with Microsoft etc and a proud windows 10 on it was from Bauhn Spere. And they told me to roll it backward into 8 and be happy with it just working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read and heard that what I want to&nbsp;have is it working as best as possible. to&nbsp;simply expand the overall storage via&nbsp;creating a single&nbsp;partition or using the 32GB Micro SD Card as the Primary drive, boot and all...&nbsp;everyone knows that its expected
 to work, but&nbsp; little slower, to me that's acceptable... will work would be a great answer, but now I need to know exactly how? And or any other methods that will have just as beneficial outcomes for me... Thank you... AJAY...</p>

<h2>            printer prints square the number of copies in win 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a problem in one of our application that when we issues a print from it, the printer prints square the number of copies than what it should. For e.g 2 prints 4, 3 prints 9 etc. Need to know why this happens, and how to fix the problem.</p>

    <title>Cannot login into windows 8, password not vaild on desktop, but valid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techgirl33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot login into windows 8, password not vaild on desktop, but valid on Microsoft website.</h2>
                    Just got a new desktop using windows 8.&nbsp; (I use Firefox's current browser.)&nbsp; Created an account with Microsoft ID on account.live.com.&nbsp; I signed on to my desktop with my same password, which is the same password that allows me access to my info on account.live.com
 website.&nbsp; I decided to log onto account.live.com and add my new email to the list of emails that have access to my account.&nbsp; Then I selected the new email address as the primary email and deleted the first email.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So now, I log onto account.live.com website and I log in with the second email and I can access my account with no problem.&nbsp; (Keep in mind I am still signed into my desktop using the first email &amp; password originally associated with my account.live.com account.)&nbsp;
 Next I signed out of my desktop.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Now I see two icons: one with the new email and one with my first email.&nbsp; I select the new email and use the password that I used to sign into&nbsp; account.live.com website.&nbsp; I get an error message stating that my password is incorrect and to go to account.live.com
 website to reset my password.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I select the icon with my first email and sign in with the password associated with it.&nbsp; I go to account.live.com website and sign using my first email &amp; password.&nbsp; I received an error message stating that my password is incorrect.&nbsp; So, I type in my second
 email address &amp; its password and I had access to my account info.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
To sum everything up: <br />
- I cannot log into account.live.com website with my first email &amp; its password; yet I can sign onto my desktop with my first email &amp; its password.<br />
- I can log into account.live.com website with my second email &amp; its password; yet I cannot sign onto my desktop with my second email &amp; its password.<br />
<br />
I have already tried resetting my password, and typing in validation codes.&nbsp; My first email can no longer be used to send reset codes since its no longer and active account on account.live.com website.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 hours with Microsoft Tech Support via online chat &amp; phone.&nbsp; I'm pretty tech savvy, but this problem is a huge problem.&nbsp; The tech tried several different ways to try to resolve this problem.&nbsp; He even took over my PC so he could see what was going on.&nbsp;
 After 2 hours of frustration and dumbfounded on his side and my side, we came to the conclusion that this like a domino affect.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I need to change my second email to the primary account on my PC, but in order to do so; I must sign onto my desktop with my second email &amp; password----but I cannot do so because I keep getting a error message that my correct password is "incorrect"!&nbsp; When
 I am signed into my desktop with my first email address; I cannot make any changes to the account because it is no longer the primary account!<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Tech apologized for not being able to resolve my problem.&nbsp; He still had control over my pc and looked into the system and stated that the Manufacturer must have embedded something in the computer.&nbsp; He told me to contact&nbsp; the Manufacturer and tell
 them that I need a "fresh PC start".<br />
<br />
So, immediately did so via online chat.&nbsp; The manufacturer tech told me this:<br />
<br />
1. Move the cursor to the lower right-hand side to open the charm bar. <br />
2. Click on Settings, then click on PC Settings. <br />
3. Click on "General."<br />
4. Scroll down, on the right side to Remove everything and Reinstall.<br />
5. Click on "Get Started." <br />
6. Choose the option that says "Only the drive where Windows is installed."<br />
7. Choose "Fully Clean the Drive."<br />
8. Click on "Reset" to start the procedure.<br />
<br />
What this unhelpful tech failed to realized that I cannot do this!&nbsp; Which I told him the beginning that the Microsoft tech has already tried to do this.&nbsp; The above "reset" cannot happen because I'm log onto the desktop using my first email address &amp; password;
 therefore I just get the error message that "this is not the primary&nbsp; account.&nbsp; In order to make changes to this computer the account administrator must be log in."&nbsp; ----But I have to state again this not possible since I cannot log onto my PC desktop with
 my second email account.<br />
<br />
Now I'm back to square one.......I found this forum and I hope you can please help me ASAP.

            Your suggestion will not work, since I cannot log into the admin. account. &nbsp;I had to contact Asus again. &nbsp;This time, I got a tech that told me how to rest my desktop to the factory default and reinstall windows 8. &nbsp;I had to tap F9/troubleshoot/rest/remove
 &amp; reinstall windows. &nbsp;Once the PC was ready, the entire windows 8 set up was different from when I first got the PC. &nbsp;So something was wrong with the software. &nbsp;Then the apps wouldn't click open. &nbsp;I contacted Asus again. &nbsp;I had to do a system restore and now
 all my apps are working, but the apps are different then they were when I first got the PC. This was probably a rare problem, but it was sure frustrating to go through. &nbsp;

                    I have recently finished with borrow some american DVD's and wish to change my region back. This is not the first time i have done it, and made sure when chaning to region 1 that i had enough chances to get back to region 2. However when i select region
 2, a box comes up saying it is my last change and the computer will stay on region 2, for which i click ok. But it then comes up with the message 'unable to update region setting. the drive reports that it requires media of the destination region (region 2)
 so please insert appropriate media and try again. I have tried doing this with a number of different region 3 DVD's. and doing it through the Device Manager, windows media player and through my HP MediaSmart DVD player.<br />
<br />
i have a HP DV6-1240ea that runs windos vista, i have had it for just over 6 months. is there anything i can do?

            Hi Faraz.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down the drive map to look for the drive by size.  Does it have a letter?  If not right click to assign one.
<br />
<br />If so right click start button to open Device Manager, find the hard drive under Disk Drives, click on Driver tab, then choose Uninstall, then from Action tab choose Scan for Hardware Changes, restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Is the drive listed in BIOS or UEFI setup?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> martinkj88  say:</h3>
<h2>            RPC_S_CALL_FAILED after 30 minutes of inactivity</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>We have a client/server application that uses DCOM. At one customer installation we have problems that the user experiences as a handful-minute delay
 when starting to use the client after letting it be idle for half an hour or more. The server is 2003 and the clients run XP. Looking at the logs from our application we see that DCOM calls on these occasions give error</span></span><span>RPC_S_CALL_FAILED
 (0x800706be, The remote procedure call failed)</span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After sniffing on Ethernet it is obvious that the server stops responding on the socket that is used for the DCOM communication. The client
 makes 8-9 retries and then fails and opens a new DCOM interface. The application requires a number of interfaces and the sum of the time spent retransmitting and reopening for all interfaces (that is sequential) adds up to minutes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The first theory was that there was some kind of idle sleep in the client, but we introduced a regular ping once every ten seconds on one
 of the interfaces and this only helps that interface. Other interfaces still have the same problem after half an hour of inactivity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Ethernet sniffing also shows the following error: “</span></span><span>Provider rejection, reason:
 Proposed transfer syntaxes not supported</span><span><span><span>“ on some occasions. This is given in Bind_ack. Can this be related to the problem?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any help you can provide to solve this issue is highly appreciated.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Parental control&#58; please help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I'm one of the many users still having issues getting online because of the terms and conditions. I'm 20 years old and my father passed away soon after I used his email address to originally sign up for xbox live so I have no way of gaining his password
 for parental consent. I have contacted xbox customer support countless times now about this, beginning with phone calls made in September, up to now. I can't believe I have been kept waiting 4 months by microsoft, and still with no prospect of getting the
 issue resolved. This is 4 months of xbox live gold membership that I am paying for and cannot use. After my first call with customer support, I was promised an email the next day. After waiting 2 weeks to recieve this email, i then called again and was promised
 the same email. I have never recieved this email, or any help and it doesn't seem like I'm going to anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel like I'm stuck in a neverending loop and cannot see anyway of getting this resolved as no one seems to care!! I've been a dedicated customer for 4 and a half years now and quite honestly I'm disgusted that after all the effort I am making to resolve
 this, nothing seems to be getting done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant but I feel I am speaking for other disgruntled xbox live customers, any help would be greatly appreciated as I still have not recieved any.</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're really 20 your live account should reflect your age and give you the option to progress into an adult account, you can use
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../online-safety</a> for help on changing your settings and as far as resetting your password just follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) Turn on your Xbox console to access the "Account Management" menu. Ensure that there is no disc in the tray</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.) Type in any phrase in the password field. You basically want to bring up the prompt with two options: "Try Again" and "I Forgot My Pass Code," with a "CLEAR" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) Select the "CLEAR" option, then press the "A-button." When prompted, type in the last four digits of the credit card&nbsp;you used to sign up for Xbox Live, then submit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.) Reset your password</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply but unfortunately I cannot access account management in my settings menu as I can't connect to xbox live in the first place without parental consent.. It's all a big catch 22 it seems! Is there a way of promoting a progressing
 onto an adult account on the xbox.com website? I would really like to avoid calling customer support if possible as I have had 4 months dealing with them and they are no help whatsoever.</p>

<p>No problem. I believe you can change your account to an adult one online. Sign in and click "Privacy and Online Settings", it's below your avatar and the edit avatar and profile options. Once there in grey boxes there are adult, teen, etc profiles, you should
 be able to click on the adult option scroll all the way to the bottom and save. If you cannot do the adult option the next best would be custom and you can pick and choose your settings which should allow you to get past the parental locks.</p>

<p>Ah I just found that, clicked on "Privacy and Online Settings" and it directs me to the terms of use again.. it seems I can't access anything to do with my account at all without parental consent.. this is nuts!! Are there any other workarounds or ways of
 accessing my account?? I'm not sure what my next move should be, this is exhausting</p>

<p>Yes, I have literally checked it daily just incase they do decide to contact me. When I spoke to them on they phone they did say that they would contact me at the email address I'm using but they just haven't followed through with it and have left me stranded
 multiple times with this promise! It's weird cos I understand security etc is a main focus of microsoft's but it shouldn't be to the point where it becomes a complete hinderance to the customer and the service can't even be used anymore.. Just would've thought
 that after 4 months they would have at least offered a solution! I would create a new account but I still have 5 months of gold left on this one and I don't think I can justify giving them anymore money until they solve this problem</p>

<p>ok well after reading the comments on that video it seems that it doesn't get rid of parental controls, I guess all that information is stored online and resetting my console will just delete all my save game data etc so I'm not sure that I should really
 reset my console to factory settings to be honest. Plus, I have been through 3 consoles since I originally set up the account so surely the information stored on there has nothing to do with the new terms and conditions and my parent's hotmail password??</p>

            Hi Mamort.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi mamort_588, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>why can&#39;t i extract rehanfx.org&#47;split-screen to windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            why can&#39;t i extract rehanfx.org&#47;split-screen to windows 7</h2>
                    Good Morning <br />
My question pertains to how can i edit you-tube videos for a channel that i am starting. I have windows media live movie maker and movie maker 2.6<br />
but i am having a problem in trying to do a split screen effect with in the transitions option. It does not contain the soft focus vertical / horizontal splits need. Also many YouTube videos suggest going to rehanfx.org in order to download this but upon doing
 so i still cannot seem to get that option. I am not that tech savvy is there anyway someone could tell me how to achieve this type of an effect for a fashion video.
<br />
<br />
P.S. I am still on a windows 7 operating system desk top that's is a few years old. My tower was reconfigured because it burned out and a new mother board was installed.&nbsp; Also is this type of editing consider a copy right infringement and how do i go about
 getting the rights to do this so that i am not breaking any laws by YouTube standards. I was under the impression that once you install windows into your system then it is not considered to be illegal but i wanted to be safe and inquiry non the less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You for all the assistance with this and have a wonderful day.____Fareeena Ally&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>You can't do custom transitions in WLMM because Microsoft hasn't published a customization API for the newer versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> do split screen using a custom transition in the classic versions.&nbsp; The problem you are having is in the installation folder. WMM 2.6 isn't in the same folder as WMM 2.1, hence the installer is confused.&nbsp; It would require a bit of work to
 get the right things moved to the right folders.&nbsp; Plus for Windows 7, I don't recommend the old WMM 2.6 version.&nbsp; You should really use the Vista version (WMM 6.0) that uses the GPU and has more powerful transitions and effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;doing&nbsp;split screen video, I would actually suggest is using <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WMM 6.0 on Windows 7</a>, Rehan's <a href="http://rehanfx.org/shader.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ShaderTFX</a> and his

<h2>            Windows 7 mouse&#47;touchpad misbehaving left right and middle click problem</h2>
                    <p>This question has been asked many times but solution seems to be short coming for me. My system is a Dell with Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>Problem: Suddenly about a month ago this problem started (no new installations were done that could have caused it). Left click suddenly stops working entirely on all running programs (except on Chrome it acts like a middle click where it closes open tabs).
 Right click also intermittently stops working. Only upon pressing ctrl+alt+delete I get back normal function or sometimes I have to cycle left-middle-right click and after a uncertain number of clicks I get normal function back. This problem occurs regardless
 of mouse, touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean the keypad/touchpad keys on the laptop.</p>
<p>New mouse and drivers</p>
<p>New touchpad and drivers</p>
<p>Uninstall chrome (thinking it might be chrome causing problem)</p>
<p>Run comprehensive Anti virus scan - nothing found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions? This appears to be a windows thing and not a hardware problem.</p>

            <p>Hi, The publishers have to give permission for the games to become backward compatible.&nbsp; You should vote for it in the feedback site&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.uservoice.com</a>.&nbsp; I'm sure Microsoft are working with all their partners in getting as many games compatible as they can.&nbsp; Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 will probably come eventually, Like Black Ops and Call of Duty 2, 3 and World at War did as well. For the complete list of games that are available, have a look&nbsp;<a href="https://majornelson.com/blog/xbox-one-backward-compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></p>

            <p>Like with all games, it comes down to the publisher to decide whether they will allow it. Since the publisher seems to be tacking the games onto the released games (slightly remastered at the same time), I doubt we will see many more released as pure backwards compatible games. You can vote for the games to be made backwards compatible:&nbsp;<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote Here</a></p>

<p>Hello Andy,</p>

<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if the "skype business" means the Skype for Business client not the regular Skype? For your reference:

Do I have Skype or Skype for Business?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it means the Skype for Business client, please update it to the latest version firstly, then try the steps described in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-contact-in-skype-for-business-89338023-2adf-4f5c-90b6-f8b6f72fadd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it means the regular Skype, we will move your thread back to Skype category to get the dedicated support.

<p>We appreciate your update and time.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, when we add the contacts to the list, we need to search them via their email address in Search bar firstly. From your description, may I know if no Search bar in your Skype for Business
 client? Please capture a screenshot about issue for us to better understand it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, please let us know if other users also have this Search bar missing issue in your organization.</p>

 my addresses are good.&nbsp; HELP!!&nbsp; i'm coming from a couple of decades on Apple platform, so this is throwing me for a loop.&nbsp; i can't figure this out.&nbsp; i've even tried cutting &amp; pasting my message into my different email account, didn't work.&nbsp; shut down my computer,
 restarted.&nbsp; didn't work.&nbsp; please talk me off the "i'm going to throw this at the wall in about three minutes" ledge ... gaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

            Hi Lori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this the Windows 10 Mail app (the envelope icon on the task bar)?  
<br />
<br />What works most is to go to Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />This may be caused by a recent Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History to see which Updates were installed about the time this started to try uninstalling them to see if that helps.   
<br />
<br />You also might also be able to get back before it via System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if it or any other Update reinstalls and causes the same problems, uninstall it again and block it using the Hide Updates tool here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can perform these operations in Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 restore to), so we didn't do that one.&nbsp; and the last recommendation, to reinstall the op system, i shouldn't have to do for a simple email application that got corrupted simply from installing the updates that microsoft pushed out.&nbsp; from what i can see by
 searching on the internet when i first started looking at this, this is has been an issue for several years. this is ludicrous.&nbsp; for now, i will simply retrieve my mail thru the browser.&nbsp; hopefully, microsoft will see their way to get this fixed soon (hope

<p>If you ate using the e-mail program that comes with Windows 10, I don't use it, so I can't help you other than to recommend that you switch to a different program. As far as I'm concerned, it's a very poor choice and almost any alternative, whether by Microsoft
 or a third-party is better.</p>

<h2>            Mass Effect 2 not working with backward compatibility</h2>
                    <p>Currently enjoying re-living the Mass Effect experience on my Xbox One through the wonderful feature of Backward compatibility. As I near the end of my intergalactic journey I was getting my self excited to play the sequel as well as number 3. So I went out and bought the Mass Effect Trilogy (Xbox 360) which included all 3 games in one sexy package.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where I've run into my issue. I put the ME2 disc into my Xbox One only to be greated with an error message which says along the lines as; 'This disc is not playable here'. And then directs me to go check the Xbox Ones backward compatibility list. However all of the three games are there.&nbsp;</p><p>So, maybe the trilogy discs don't count toward backward compatibility and you have to buy each game separate on disc for it to work? Seemed likely as companies often have these weird grey areas when it comes to this sort of stuff.&nbsp;Well so I thought. As a test I went to go try and use ME3 and strangely enough that worked s

<p>Found on Reddit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: update, you're all right guys. While you were commenting, I successfully got through to Xbox Support time around and the support member was able to explain it. Basically disc 2 does not have the license unlike the first disc, that one was
 to install and the other was to launch and play the game.</p>
<p>If I don't need to worry about D2 then I guess I'm all good. But thank you for the comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>—</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get to “needing” disc two in game, it’ll ignore that and let you play. So ignore disc 2 and we’re good!</p>

It runs really smooth on the one and only requires one disc during play.

<h2>            Desktop screen flashing every two seconds after Win10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 now my laptop boots up fine and then I log in and the screen begins to flash every 1-2 seconds. Nothing will load and the only thing that works is Ctl/Alt/Del will bring up the task manager which shows the system CPU running at 100%
 on average. The desktop will continue to flash at the same rate in the background while I am able to navigate the task manager. Does anyone have any ideas???</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video. Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</p>

<p>
</p><p>-Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us with the status. We will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>How do i print contacts in Windows mail. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geraldbaileywg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i print contacts in Windows mail.</h2>
                    I am just trying to learn windows 8.1. My e mails are sent using Windows mail. I would like to print out all of the e mail addresses&nbsp;I have on my new computer so that I can put the pages&nbsp; into a book. I use this list to add other information about each
 person. Is there a program that will let me print out the addresses? I am putting in addresses a few at a time. On my old XP computer I can print out the addresses called an mail address Book. How can I transfer the list to my new computer? If I need a new
 program for this, will it cause problems with my current e mail system&gt; Thanks, Gerry
<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi Gerry,<br />
<br />
Are you trying to print the contacts from Windows live mail or Mail app (People App)?<br />
<br />
If you are trying to print the contacts from Windows live mail, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
How do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore</span></a><br />
<br />
If you are trying to print the contacts from Mail app (people app), then you will not be able to print from mail app, you will have to download the contacts from webmail in .csv format and then try to print.<br />
<br />
