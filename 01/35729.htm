            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•&nbsp;Do the CDs play fine on another computer? <br />
•&nbsp;What software changes did you make on the computer prior to the issue? </div>
<div><br />
Method 1:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Disable speaker audio enhancements and check if that fixes the issue.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow these steps to disable audio enhancements: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Start” and click “Control Panel.”<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type “Sound.”<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the search results, click “Sound.”<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the “Playback” tab, click “Speakers”, and then click “Properties.”<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the “Enhancements” tab, and then select the “Disable all enhancements” check box.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
Additionally, also disable SRS WOW effects and see if that fixes the issue:&nbsp;<br />

<p>I don't know about ME3, but completed saves I deleted from Mass Effect still carried over to Mass Effect 2.</p>
<p>[/quote]That's because Mass Effect Select Existing ID/ import saves are not game saves. Whereas in Mass Effect 2 you import any save from after the Suicide Mission.</p>

<p>The problem with that would be that data synced to the cloud storage won't be recognized by ME3.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 Store and Update Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>When Windows store is opened it loads for about two seconds and displays "<em> We
</em><em>weren't able to connect to the Store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed out. Please wait a few minutes and try again (0x80072ee2)".</em></p>
<p>I already tried the program that detects what is wrong with windows apps but it doesn't work, syncing time with time.windows.com, using local account and microsoft account, restarting my PC and internet connection. I have no proxy connections and I have
 a stable internet connection at the moment.<strong> Can you suggest ways to fix this?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another concern is I am having problems checking for updates (error 80072EE2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance!</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Yes I've tried that. Along with several suggestions I found online, like disconnecting the power cord&nbsp;as I power cycle, and deleting my local saves. The only thing I haven't tried is deleting my profile and then recalling it for fear I&nbsp;may lose my standing on the monthly achievement leaderboard which I'm currently at the top at in first place. I was going to do that once it starts over in May. On a side note I&nbsp;did get the blueray player and the movie and t.v. updates to install. I still can not uninstall or play a boy and his blob though. The only reason I'm trying to uninstall it is so I can reinstall it and see if it will fix why its not working so I can play it. Any other ideas or maybe thoughts on who to get a hold of to fix this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there QuagmireOneLeg.<br /><br />Removing and adding back your profile shouldn't affect your achievements, so I&nbsp;would definitely give that a try. If you're still having issues, it may be worth giving your Xbox One a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">full Factory Reset</a>. Unfortunately you'll need to reinstall all your Games &amp; Apps, but that should hopefully clear up the issue.</p>

<br />
<br />AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys - AMD Ryzen Master Driver
<br />Driver date - Mon Nov 13 22:58:28 2017
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. AMD Ryzen Master Driver needs an update as this is very old, of Nov 2017.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Dew,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />All the dumps have verifier enabled, which might not point to the actual driver. Can you share some crash dumps without verifier enabled, for better diagnosis?

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
EA Games have an online age requirement of 18+ when connecting to their online platform. This is a limitation put in by EA themselves not by Microsoft. It takes the age you put in when you first created your LIVE account. Regardless of changing any settings
 this message will not go away as your account is not old enough in EA's eyes in order to be able to play their games online. It's the same with Battlefield 3, Madden, NHL, FIFA, etc, the age of the account needs to be 18+ to be able to connect to EA's Online
 servers.<br />
<br />
The only way around this would be to create a new account that has the age of 18+ in order to be able to play this particular game online.<br />
<br />
Sorry.</p>

<p>Sorry the correct age requirement on EA games is actually 13 or over not 18, so to be able to play any EA game online/multiplayer is you have to be over 13

<p>Explain that to the people that are trying to play FIFA 13, Madden 2013, Battlefield 3 with an account that has an age of 13 but less than 18. They get the same error, it only goes away when you make an account with an age of 18+.<br />
<br />
I say this because my cousin has an account that's was setup at age 15 and attempted to play Battlefield 3 online, purchased it for his birthday and was unable to play online with the same exact error. He had to create a new account with an age of 18 and it
 started to work, he lost his gold membership but that was the only game he wanted to play.</p>

<p>I'm not disagreeing you with there, but I said that the account was the age of 15 (which is older than 13 like you suggested but under 18) and he was unable to play Battlefield 3 on that account. He was only able to play once he made an account with a DOB
 of 18 or older. I don't quite know why, but that's what I was going off of.</p>

<h2>            Skype</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft, I have been using Skype now for years, in Windows 10, only to see a slow deterioration in the program. My question is .... When I Skype people I have always been able to see a small window superimposed on the screen showing myself and as
 such how the person on the other end of the video sees me. Today that has disappeared. how can I get it back?</p>
<p>I have checked other forums and other people are asking the same question. They receive an answer from someone from Microsoft which has no relevance to their question. So you can understand why I am reluctant to ask a question of Microsoft when no one there
 seems to understand a simple question written in plain English. Again the question is, how do I get my window back. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 CCleaner OS crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samuel gardner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 CCleaner OS crash</h2>
                    <p>Hello, after I used CCleaner to clear up space on my hard drive, it disabled some standard windows features, like Task manager or the control panel. Then everything stopped working except the processes that were currently running. At the advise of my sibling,
 I attempted to reboot the system which made the situation worse, and by that I mean that the computer could turn on, but could discovered a massive problem in the core system and attempted repairs, that didn't succeed. After the attempt to repair, the computer
 would restart itself trying to find a different solution to the problem; that lasted a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I attempted to create a repair disc from the family Windows 7 pro laptop, which was created successfully but did not solve the issue. Realizing that the computer was in a state which was unfixable, I asked the same sibling who could get instant legit
 Windows Operating Systems from an old IT friend, because they work with cyber security and IT. Sadly, said individuals didn't get back to him. So I wasn't the brightest when I did not create an OS backup disc in case this issue happened, but I did not receive
 a product code for Windows 7 with the Desktop, because it was not a factory purchase, custom built, and was bought from someone who owned it priorly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have no clue what to do, because the product key that the laptop uses cannot get another OS to use. Any advise or other procedures I didn't know about would be very preferable. Please and thank you, for any help provided.</p>

            <p>1. To be frank, I do not remember, about two years ago, I know it was a legit freshly installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit OS with Registry code already applied to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. and 3. I followed the advise of my IT Teacher, and received a non-activated OS disc, so I could find the registry codes and data that was on the old OS. I did not Format the Hard drive, I created a new OS on it and put the old OS into "Windows.old", so
 all the logs are still present, or so I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Could I find the old registry code in the old windows logs? or is it lost without the original disc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A small issue with the temporary OS (which expires without registry code{that I do not even have} in 25 days) is that it is 32-bit and the logs of many programs are locked off because they were 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also I do not know why my account on this changed)</p>
<p>(Also I apologize for the few days late response)</p>

<p>There is a way to get the printer icon to display on your windows taskbar....</p>
<p>
</p><p>couldn't find this solution anywhere but here's how to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-create a folder called 'shortcuts' in documents</p>
<p>-right-click your printer(s) in control panel and select create shortcut (goes to desktop)</p>
<p>-move the created shortcut to the folder you created in documents</p>
<p>-right-click taskbar, toolbar, new toolbar</p>
<p>-browse to and select the folder called shortcuts in documents</p>
<p>-right-click the new toolbar and de-select show text/title</p>
<p>
</p><p>any shortcut you put in that shortcuts folder will now appear in your taskbar</p>

                    Pretty simple question. If I was signed in without a Microsoft account as user ABC, my account name would be ABC. But logged in with my Microsoft account, WXY@Z, I can't seem to find any User object WXY. Any help here? I'm probably missing something simple.

    <title>Accidentally installed WIN 10 Pro when my license is for Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kg333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally installed WIN 10 Pro when my license is for Home</h2>
                    <p>I recently suffered a MB failure and had to get a new one and added an SSD. I have a WIN10 Home Full Edition disc which I purchased online. When I reinstalled yesterday I was prompted to install either HOME or PRO. Not considering the consequences I chose
 Pro cuz, hey PRO seems better right? Well, later on I was prompted to NOT select NEW INSTALL since this was a reinstall. After several hours and the INSANELY slow creators fall update or whatever it is I finished and was able to start using my PC. I stayed
 up all night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening I decided to go ahead and activate. Guess what, I can't. After hours of T/S and contacting MS "support" via chat they concluded that the only way to correct this is to reinstall WIN10 and choose HOME. Ok, well why was I given the option to install
 PRO if it wasn't actually an option?? I have been reading responses from MS techs that this shouldn't be possible from a OEM disc. But it is. I am the proof. After over an hour chatting with this support person and being GRILLED about my fully paid for copy
 I allowed her remote access which, to her credit, she did seem to try and fix the issue for me. But in the end she tried to reinstall windows when I already said NO I do not want to do that right now. She then disconnected the conversation without even saying
 thanks for chatting, good luck. VERY unprofessional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have to hope reinstalling from the disc will work and after 4 hours or so when I get to the activation point again. I do not feel confident that it will and MS will try to steal more money from me for a new license when I have a legitimate copy.
 Yes, I made a mistake choosing PRO but the option should NOT have been there or a warning should be given about switching versions. Seems very shady to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and by the way during my T/S steps I was prompted that to activate I MUST log into a MS account and then was FORCED to change my PC log-in password to my MS account password. I don't like being told what to do with my own PC. Makes me wish Ubuntu was
 more versatile. :(</p>

<p>You will have to reinstall Windows again because you installed the pro. version when you should have installed the home version. You can download the ISO from the MS site. I highly suggest you do that. When you do that, no need to worry to accidentally install
 the pro. Your device came with Win. 10 or was it an upgrade?</p>

<p>This. And no, MS won't allow me to roll back to HOME. Because..they make the rules. I should buy 3 or 4 more copies of WIN 10 JUST IN CASE..! Yes, I know I made a mistake. However, as I stated the option should not have been there at all! If not I wouldn't
 have chosen PRO. Being accused by "WINDOWS" and MS support of having a boot leg copy when I paid full price is really insulting. See, it even says right there "<em>running a NON-GENUINE copy of WINDOWS can put you at risk for viruses!"
</em>No kidding? Well how does one buy a GENUINE copy of WINDOWS if the one I bought from Newegg or Fry's (I forget) is NOT genuine?? The cherry on top of it all is the thank you message I got from MS support. "Glad we solved your problem! Contact us again
 if you need any help!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I'm off to reinstall WINDOWS again. See you in 4-5 hours. I sure hope almighty MS allows me to use the software I paid for! So aggravating.&nbsp;</p>

            Based on the screenshot you provided, your previous Windows was not activated because you do not have a license. The Windows you got was most likely pirated, that is why your Windows can't be activated. Never buy Windows from none trusted website. Only
 buy Windows from the Microsoft store, Best Buy, etc. or go visit a store to buy it. Even though it will cause a little bit more money, but it is worth it. You might need to return the copy you bought and buy a genuine one or buy a license. Buying it from a
 none trusted site or buying a pirated one is bad because like the screenshot stated, viruses, attacks, etc. can happen and no one knows what is in it. What version of Windows did you have before?

</p><p>Sorry guy, but you are totally wrong. 2 things for you to ponder.</p>
<p>1) If you read my previous comments you would know that it WAS activated and I used it for over a year (NOV2016The issue was I took the offer to install PRO when I should not have.</p>
<p>2) I think Newegg would be very offended at your accusation that they are selling bootleg Windows discs.</p>

<p>Issue is resolved by reinstalling HOME version. It took near 4 hours. A pain in the neck but now I can move on.</p>

    <title>Why does &#34;try running sfc &#47;scannow&#34; keep coming up as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does &#34;try running sfc &#47;scannow&#34; keep coming up as something to try when it is unlikely to help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am confused when helpers (especially with "Microsoft Support, Moderator" monikers) reply to a new problem in the XP forums with a<br />
suggestion along the lines of "try running sfc /scannow" to fix problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never seen sfc /scannow fix a single problem and it does not replace any missing or corrupt files that would in any way effect system operation. &nbsp;I will not even suggest it as a&nbsp;troubleshooting&nbsp;step because I know how it works and what it does and
 does not do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not replace missing or corrupt system files that are going to come into play in XP. &nbsp;It does replace missing or corrupt backup copies of system files, but the backup copies of files are not going to be the files that need to be fixed or might be
 missing. &nbsp;Delete them all and your system will still run just fine.</p>
<p>Under general conditions, to run sfc /scanow, you must also have a genuine bootable Windows XP installation CD that matches your currently installed Service Pack. &nbsp;It is unlikely that most people are in&nbsp;possession&nbsp;of a genuine bootable XP installation CD
 and it is even more unlikely that they would be in possession of a slipstreamed XP installation CD with a current Service Pack, unless you made such a CD yourself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those two factors alone make a suggestion of "try running sfc /scannow" a big, frustrating time waster. &nbsp;It "feels good" when it works and finds nothing to do, but you won't solve any problems with it. &nbsp;It is not a system file replacer/copier as some seem
 to believe.</p>
<p>Ideas for fixing problems should be generally applicable to the most situations that are most likely to occur in reality, not generally impossible situations that are unlikely to exist in the real world. &nbsp;Most folks have never even seen a genuine bootable
 XP installation CD.</p>
<p>Suggestions or references to ideas or Microsoft KB articles that start with words like "use or boot on your XP installation CD..." are not likely to go very far at all if a system has no CD drive or the poster has no genuine bootable XP installation CD.<br />
<br />
Here is what sfc /scannow does:<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will check and populate/replace missing or corrupt files in the following folder ONLY:<br />
<br />
%Systemroot%\system32\dllcache</p>
<p>That is not the folder XP uses when it is starting or running. &nbsp;You can empty it and XP will still run just fine.<br />
<br />
When XP is first installed and booted for the first time, sfc /scannow runs once automatically to populate the<br />
%Systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder with backup copies of what XP considers critical system files.<br />
<br />
The files in the %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder are what XP considers "Protected Files" and there are exactly 3498 protected files,<br />
but there be more files than that in the %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder. Windows File protection only looks after the list of 3498<br />
files.<br />
<br />
Here is what sfc /scannow does not do:<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow does not replace any missing or corrupt files in the following folder:<br />
<br />
%Systemroot%\system32<br />
<br />
<br />
If your system is not afflicted in some way, learn how Windows File Protection and System File Checker really works, by doing this with one of the 3498 files that XP Windows File Protection monitors:<br />
<br />
Navigate to c:\windows\system32 and rename taskmgr.exe to taskmgr.old.<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection will quickly and silently replace the "missing" taskmgr.exe file with the backup copy from the dllcache folder<br />
(that is what Windows File Protection does).<br />
<br />
Look for a message like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
Delete the taskmgr.old file (the copy make earlier) and verify that Task Manager still works.<br />
<br />
Boot the system in Safe Mode so that Windows File Protection is not running.<br />
<br />
Navigate to c:\windows\system32 and rename taskmgr.exe to taskmgr.old (taskmgr.exe is now "missing").<br />
<br />
Since Windows File protection does not run in Safe Mode, taskmgr.exe will not automatically be replaced like it was before and Task<br />
Manager will not launch either from CTRL-ALT-DEL or from the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that running sfc /scannow in Safe Mode will result in an error like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files.<br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable.].<br />
<br />
You cannot start the RPC Server in Safe Mode either.<br />
<br />
It is a waste of time and effort to suggest trying to run sfc /scannow in Safe Mode - it will not even launch.<br />
<br />
Boot the system normally and verify that c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe is still missing and Task Manager still does not work.<br />
<br />
You can navigate to c:\windows\system32\dllcache (where the backup files are) and still launch Task Manager from there by double<br />
clicking the backup copy of taskmgr.exe file from there, but Task Manager will not launch in the "usual" manners.<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow successfully and let it complete and it should find nothing to do.&nbsp; The only messages in the Event Viewer will<br />
be from when sfc /scannow started and when sfc /scannow completed.<br />
<br />
If you try to launch Task Manager now, Task Manager still will not work because taskmgr.exe will still be missing from the<br />
c:\windows\system32 folder.&nbsp; That means running sfc /scannow did not replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Running sfc /scannow doesl not replace missing files in the c:\windows\system32 folder.<br />
<br />
Copy some boring text file like c:\boot.ini into the c:\windows\system32 folder and call the copy taskmgr.exe.&nbsp; Now, the taskmgr.exe<br />
file is no longer "missing", but taskmgr.exe is "corrupt" since it is really just a text file.<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow successfully and let it complete and it should find nothing to do.&nbsp; The only messages in the Event Viewer will<br />
be the one from when sfc /scannow started and when sfc /scannow completed.<br />
<br />
If you try to launch Task Manager now, Task Manager still will not work because the taskmgr.exe is really just a copy of c:\boot.ini.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:&nbsp; Running sfc /scannow does not replace "corrupted" files in the c:\windows\system32 folder.<br />
<br />
Now learn what running sfc /scannow really does (it maintains the %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder).<br />
<br />
Navigate to c:\windows\system32\dllcache and rename taskmgr.exe to taskmgr.old (now the backup copy of the file is "missing").&nbsp; The backup copy of taskmgr.exe will not be automatically replaced when it is missing.<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow successfully and let it complete and it will replace the missing taskmgr.exe file from the dllcache folder.&nbsp; The<br />
only messages in the Event Viewer will be from when sfc /scannow started and when sfc /scannow completed.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:&nbsp; Running sfc /scannow will populate the dllcache folder when Protected Files are missing in the dllcache folder.&nbsp; In<br />
other words, sfc /scannow will only replace missing files from %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache.<br />
<br />
Repeat the test by copying the c:\boot.ini file into c:\windows\system32\dllcache and replace or overwrite the taskmgr.exe file (making<br />
the copy of taskmgr.exe "corrupted").<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow successfully and let it complete and it will replace the "corrupted" taskmgr.exe file from the dllcache folder.&nbsp; The<br />
only messages in the Event Viewer will be from when sfc /scannow started and when sfc /scannow completed.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:&nbsp; Running sfc /scannow will populate the dllcache folder when Protected Files are corrupted in the dllcache folder.<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow only replaces files in %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache and replaces no files in %Systemroot%\system32.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Probably better discussed in the XP Forums. (Actually Answers has no real place to discuss trouble<br />
shooting methods which is possibly due to the fact that such discussions generally&nbsp;result in rude<br />
shouting matches.)</p>
<p>Actually SFC can call for the Installation Media to replace System Files and there are other command<br />
line options other than /scannow.</p>
<p>Description of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 System File Checker (Sfc.exe)<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747</a></p>
<p>Description of the Windows File Protection feature<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193</a><br />
<br />
Certainly many try to suggest running SFC /scannow as a fix all solution which it is not. However often<br />
it is not suggested as part of a solution when it should have been or at least including it would have been<br />
prudent.<br />
<br />
Personally I suggest running it as "part" of a solution anytime corruption is considered a probable cause<br />
and also suggest running check disk as well. All too often the immediate issue could have been "fixed"<br />
while the root cause or other issues would have remained hidden to pop up later if SFC and CheckDisk<br />
were not run.<br />
<br />
SFC and CheckDisk are not "Fix-it-All" solutions, as some seem to think, however not specifying them in<br />
many cases can also be a mistake.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            What a useless waste of Cyberspace this article and it's comments are. It all sums up to SFC /Scannow does practically nothing, great, tell us something new, like I dunno, what DOES work? There is no do, or try, just blather.

            <p>Like I have said a thousand times...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggesting sfc /scannow is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and people that like to suggest it never determine if there is a genuine bootable XP installation CD of the same Service Pack as the installed Service Pack (which they have also not determined) which will be a requirement or SFC is going to complain -
 a lot.&nbsp; Most people posting questions in this community have never seen a genuine bootable XP installation CD in their life.&nbsp; "Contact your system manufacturer and see if they will send you one or ask a friend"?&nbsp; Sure thing, buddy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what are you going to do if you happen to have such a CD and your system doesn't have a CD/DVD drive (also they forgot to ask that)?</p>
