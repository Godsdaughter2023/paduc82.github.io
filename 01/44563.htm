    <title>Win 10 Update, keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick roger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Update, keyboard not working</h2>
                    <blockquote>Yesterday Windows (Win10 Home) performed a long update, now my keyboard won't work. This of course makes it difficult to provide some information that may be needed to help me. Here's
 what I can tell you (obviously I'm doing this from another computer):<br />
The keyboard is MS Wireless Comfort K/bd 1.0A, model 1045; this links via the MS Wireless Desktop Receiver 3.1A which also supports the Wireless Optical Mouse 3.1A (which is working).<br />
The keyboard/mouse/receiver (and screen) are also connected via a switch to another PC with Win10 Home; initially this was not updated and everything still worked. The OS on the working system was version 1703, build 15063.726; I cannot give you the same details
 for the failed system because Settings|About does not now display the OS information, unlike on the older, working version.<br />
I checked Device Manager which tells me I have Driver Version 9.9.108.0 and that this is up to date and working. I have removed and replaced the keyboard's batteries - no change. I have pressed the button on the receiver, the green LEDs flash for a while but
 the keyboard still isn't working.<br />
What I can do? Please remember I have no keyboard. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I Restarted both computers (pity, the second one updated) The keyboard is now not working on either system but the mouse is fine on both.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the computers has a PS2 interface, I found an old PS2 keyboard in the loft (MS Wired keyboard RT2300); it has lights (1, A, down-arrow) and 1 is lit. I unplugged the USB connection for the keyboard
 (via the desktop receiver) and plugged in the PS2 device, then restarted. Keystrokes are still not recognised.
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at Device Manager I can't see that anything changed even though I've swapped the keyboard (on the one with the PS2 interface). Without a keboard I can't break into the boot up to see what I could do there.
 I tried to download a driver for the PS2 keyboard from this MS site:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=MK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=MK</a><br />
but that responds with "This download is no longer available."</p>
<p>Any screen I can get to without using a keyboard I can make an image of and post here since my laptop is cloud-connected with both desktops; if that might help.</p>
<p><br />
I thought I might try Remote Desktop but ... "Your Home edition of Windows 10 doesn't support Remote Desktop". I really shouldn't have to pay Microsoft £120 (to upgrade to W10 Pro) in order to (possibly) attempt a fix to an MS error.
</p>
<p>I have attached two screenshots. The first shows System|About from one of the updated computers; the second is from my laptop (I've now delayed its update to 31st Dec). As you can see, it now doesn't say what version/build
 the OS is. </p>

<p>Thank you for responding, it is very useful to have the official support phone number for Microsoft in the UK as previous searches have provided many spoofs (companies pretending to be Microsoft and probably intending harm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to fix the problem, I think pressing the Windows key + Space bar worked in this case.</p>

                    <p>Recently I purchased a cat-6 Ethernet cable and worked flawlessly until this moment.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on Start &gt; Select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>Type IPconfig</p>
<p>Press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see a Gateway listed as 0.0.0</p>
<p>ignore this value and look for the one with four sets of numbers separated by periods. This will be something like 192.168.11.1.&nbsp; Write this number down; you’ll need it later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the <em>Network and Sharing Center</em> by right-clicking on the network icon in the System Tray at the lower right-hand corner of your screen.&nbsp; Once there, click
<em>Change Adapter Settings</em> on the left side of the window.</p>
<p>This will take you to a listing of your installed network adapters.&nbsp; Locate the adapter you’re using, right-click it and select
<em>Properties</em>.&nbsp; In the <em>Connection Properties</em> window, select the <em>
Internet Protocol Version 4</em> line&nbsp;(Fig. 1) &nbsp;and click the <em>Properties </em>
button below. </p>
<p>Once in <em>Properties</em>, click the <em>Advanced </em>button, and use the
<em>Add</em> feature under Default gateways to add your router’s IP address.&nbsp; Once entered, click
<em>OK</em> and/or <em>Close</em> until you’re out of the network configuration windows.
</p>
<p>Reboot your PC.</p>
<p>The problem should now be resolved.</p>

 thread posted about COD be locked immediately with a link to that thread posted.

<p>It's not me being spiteful, hating on COD or anything but every other thread in this folder is "help I've been deranked!" or "this kid hacked me while I was playing COD!" or "there's modders in COD and you're not doing anything about it, I'm moving to the
 PS3". Generally it's those three things over and over again with some slight variations&nbsp;when the answers to those questions can be easily found in Grey's aforementioned mighty FAQ of mightyness. Now either people are not noticing the thread (fat chance, it's
 a sticky and has the phrase COD in the title) or are posting new threads anyway on the off chance they get a glimmer of hope instead of the cold hard reality of Grey's mighty FAQ of mightyness. Whichever it is I think we need to put a stop to it, open Grey's
 mighty FAQ of mightyness up to questions posted <strong><em>in that thread </em>
</strong>and then we can stop repeating ourselves over and over. </p>

<p>In all seriousness though if someone in authority is reading that could my ideas at least be put on the table for discussion? There's some really great FAQs on here that answer the majority of the questions posed in new threads on here that are being ignored
 for some strange reasons I can't fathom. At least if we have all the questions and answers in those FAQ threads it saves people hunting through pages and pages of the various forums for the answer they need, giving up after page five then posting a new thread
 and making the problem of finding an answer for another user just that little bit harder.</p>

<h2>            How to delete a directory and files owned by SYSTEM&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>i have tried to uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials in order to make a clean install, but the uninstall left behind a directory owned by SYSTEM. I cannot delete it (as administrator), nor can i change it's ownership to me, nor can I delete the system
 permissions, as I either receive an error message or the relevant button is greyed-out. &nbsp;I have tried these both for the directory file itself, and for files contained in it (which I also need to remove). &nbsp;How on earth can I delete them? &nbsp;Thanks in advance,
 Anna</p>

            You have to uninstall Security Essentials using the program uninstaller in the control panel.

<h3> frankymacky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acrobat Reader upgrade prevents Windows 7 64-bit Explorer preview</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Acrobat Reader on 64-bit Windows 7 to Adobe Reader XI.&nbsp; Now my Windows Explorer preview pane no longer shows previews of PDF files.&nbsp; The most relevant hit I found online was<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/file-cant-be-previewed-error-in-the-pdf-preview/369f87c0-303b-4d74-975f-76cddab9e5b1,<br />
<br />
which points to a registry fix at<br />
<br />
http://www.fixya.com/support/t5352123-error_in_pdf_preview_handler_vista.<br />
<br />
However, my registry already contains the corrected value.&nbsp; This same fix is provided at Adobe as recently as 13 June 2013:<br />
<br />
http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1231685<br />
<br />
I suspect that the most recent Reader update requires a different preview handler fix.<br />
<br />
Thanks if anyone can provide a fix for the current Reader.<br />

            Problem solved.&nbsp; I simply logged out of my normal account and in to my admin account to see if the problem showed up there (it did).&nbsp; When I logged out of the admin account and logged back into the normal account, the problem was gone.&nbsp; Which is odd because
 prior to seeing the problem, I was temporarily in the admin account to do the update, then logged out to log in to the normal account (at which time I saw the problem).

    <title>Bluetooth Audio stutters after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorinpetrov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Audio stutters after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Bluetooth headphones for about two years now with my laptop and there was always the internet/wifi being slower when using bluetooth. Today however, the audio started stuttering heavily making it almost impossible to listen to anything. I
 paired the headphones with the phone and everything works fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I updated the WLAN driver but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went next to the Bluetooth driver, got the latest one from the manufacturer website and that's when I noticed:</p>
<p>I'm sitting on Microsoft Bluetooth 2006 drivers and I can't get rid of them. Bluetooth Enumerator, Bluetooth LE Enumerator and Protocol support driver. I never&nbsp;installed&nbsp; these drivers and I did a full system check about a year ago and all the drivers were
 in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime in the past couple of months Windows decided to install the 2006 default drivers and use them. I installed the Intel driver for (Qualcomm Atheros Communications) but it didn't delete the older drivers. I manually deleted them and after restart they
 reinstalled. I tried completely deleting all drivers and installing the Intel one, but the other three still install and seem to be in active use (because the headphones connect/play without the Intel one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: Uninstalled everything and after restart it apparently does a rollback and reinstall all 2006 drivers again.<br />
Update 2: If I turn wifi off, the audio works fine<br />
Update 3: Installed another set of drivers from Atheros and nothing changed. Now I have three sets of drivers and can't delete any of them because after restart everything is back in place...</p>
<p />

<p>Hi SorinPetrov,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons why this issue occur. I'd like to know what method are you using to uninstall the drivers and to install the new one. Also, what is the specific update that you recently installed? In the meantime, I suggest you perform a clean boot
 by following the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persist, create a test user profile and see if issue will persist. Also try to uninstall and reinstall&nbsp; the drivers on that user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward the results.</p>

            I may have "mis-clicked". &nbsp;This response did NOT answer my question. &nbsp;As I said, I have done all the updates including the one released today. &nbsp;I can connect. &nbsp;I just cannot STAY connected. &nbsp;After just a minute or so of inactivity, the connection is broken.

<h2>            HP g60-530us laptop on Windows 10 only displays on external screen</h2>
                    <p>3 days after updating the laptop I started the laptop. The screen displayed the bios loading and the main screen till when the opening window appears for the login. Then it went blank. The power button is set to shutdown so I cycled it through rebooting
 several times with the exact same results. I then booted with the same results of the screen going blank and plugged in an external monitor. There was my display. The mousepad and keyboard work fine so I logged in. I used the screen selection utility several
 times to try and "detect" the other display and it would not find it. I deleted both the monitor and display adaptor&nbsp; (Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1))&nbsp;&nbsp;in the device manager and rebooted. The screen came
 back the wrong size but both now worked. I thought that windows would repair itself from the missing drivers and it did. My display went black!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the HP and intel websites and used their auto-detect programs and they both said everything is up-to-date. Having to go and hook up to a monitor kind of defeats the purpose of having a laptop. I am looking for a recommendation here - Do I go back
 to Windows 7 pro or hope that MS will fix the drivers soon?</p>
<p>

            <p>I installed windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite c670 and I did the same thing you did uninstall the intel display adapter drivers in device manager and checked delete drivers from disk when uninstalling. I then rebooted. When rebooting I entered the bios and
 looked for something related to the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a setting under advanced system configuration called "Power On Display" with two options [Auto-Selected] Selects an external monitor if one is connected otherwise it selects the internal display. and [System LCD Only] Selects the internal display
 even if one is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the [System LCD Only] option saved changes and exited the system booted into windows. The primary display worked with generic MS drivers. I did a windows update and it reinstalled the intel drivers. After the drivers were installed it was back
 to a black screen on the internal display and only displaying on the external vga monitor port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be some sort of intel driver problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Kindly follow the below steps
</span><span>if you see the black/ flickering screen
</span><strong>only</strong><span>
</span><strong>after sign-in </strong><span>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start
<strong>Task Manager</strong>. </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If this resolves the black screen, run the all apps PowerShell command. Try this:</span>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press Windows Key + R on your keyboard.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Key in <em>PowerShell</em> and hit Enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right click on the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select
<em>Run as Administrator</em>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now paste the following command in the <em>Administrator: Windows PowerShell</em> window and press Enter key:
</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 34.5pt"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp; When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully it’ll start working. If not, this solution won’t apply to you, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue persists then follow the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to update the Display adapters driver from the Device Manager and check if it works.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start button and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select the Graphic driver from the list by extending <strong>Display adapters</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the Graphic driver and click on <strong>Update driver Software</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists then, I would recommend you to download and install the latest video driver for the manufacturer and check if it works.</p>

            <p>Having the same issue with Toshiba Satellite c67/670D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen remained blank for over an hour. I plugged in an external monitor</p>
<p>and there was my log on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bios set to LCD Only yet external monitor remains the only source of viewing.</p>
<p>I have the latest Intel drivers for the HD 3000 Graphics and still I have a Blank screen but can view on External Monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Powershell fix and that doesn't work So the only thing left for me to do now is to roll back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel need to sort their act out on this one with a bit more help from Microsoft. It seems that neither company have a clue on how to rectify this major issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not impressed!</p>

            <p>Try the following for TEMPORARY fix. Whilst Using external monitor...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall the graphics drivers completely. This will leave the laptop with Basic windows drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Update Driver using the Microsoft automated search system (update driver)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Once drivers have been detected and installed, DO NOT Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Turn laptop off completely and unplug external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Turn laptop back on and the screen appears on the lapto as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Down side to this is that you cannot use the Restart Button. You must use the shut down each time or put your laptop to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the Restart button then you will have to plug in your external monitor again or do a soft shutdown by holding power button in for 4 seconds.</p>

            <p>The problem has fixed itself. I left the system on and hooked up to the external monitor but had not been using it. I tried several of the techniques to fix it from the following emails and none worked. I left my system problem reporting on just in case
 they found an issue with one of my drivers at MS and they must have. I have had several updates and when I powered off and powered back on 2 nights ago both monitors stayed on. I disconnected the external and cycled power and things are still working. I still
 think it was a driver problem with the 4 Series Express Chipset but i don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>No support for many graphics.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Upgrade to 8.1 or stay with 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing to do with Microsoft this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only way round this is to ensure you never use the Restart Button and just select</p>
<p>shutdown, Hibernate or Sleep or stick an external monitor on when restarting.</p>

<p>After being told by Intel that my graphics wasn't compatible with windows 10 I decided to test this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reverted my system back to win7 and cleared the software distribution download folder.</p>

</p><p>I downloaded all the available drivers for 8.1 &nbsp;and then used the media creation tool&nbsp;from Microsoft and installed win 10. Unlike the previous attempts whereby I was presented with a Blank LCD Screen and a working external screen I was now presented with
 both screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now up and running with the Toshiba C670.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Intel and Microsoft, this laptop shouldn't be working on Windows 10.</p>

            Its the software for video card not compatible.go to device manager and disable it.If you uninstall it it will be reloaded upon next reboot, and you'll be back to blank screen ,not black .big difference. the problem is from card manufacturer having compatible
 driver for win10 . need troubleshoot Compatibility for device driver.Good luck.this will leave you with featureless/default video, but you can see it

    <title>How can I broadcast a single program on another screen wirelessly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelcamirand  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I broadcast a single program on another screen wirelessly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 pro and I wish to broadcast several screens of Microsoft Project 2007 onto an external monitor. Like news channels that have several things going on at the same time. I don't want to simply screen share. If i have 5 or 6 projects, I would
 like my office to be able to see them on a large screen in another room and they can track changes as they happen. Of course, I don't want them to see everything on my computer and I would like the Projects to be open even though I have minimized the program
 on my screen. I hope someone knows of something that can help me out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>The program I personally use for this is TeamViewer (<a href="http://www.teamviewer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.teamviewer.com</a>) which lets you:</p>

            <p>I was thinking about a program (nothing specific) a bit different than TeamViewer. I use teamviewer quite a bit at the office and its not quite what i need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need more of a passive broadcast, so even if my window is minimized, it will still broadcast it to the screen. Furthermore, if i have 5 minimized windows, id like to be able to arrange them on the screen and be able to project them even if they are minimized.
 They just need to always be up no matter what im doing on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea goes back to the news programs, where you have weather in one corner and traffic in another and the news anchors in another, etc.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>News broadcasts use hardware switchers to combine images from multiple inputs in real-time.&nbsp; On a PC I'm not sure you can broadcast anything while an app is minimized (at least not the minimized screen directly) because the image no longer writes to the
 screen buffer when the application is not visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm honestly really not sure how else you might accomplish it but perhaps other community visitors can provide more insight than I can.</p>

 Simple and worked for us, but probably not quite what you're looking for.</p>

<h2>            My extended display is pixelated in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lenovo y50 4k laptop. I have extended my display to a Dell 24in Screen with 1920x1080p display. But if i have set different display settings to both screens, my screen on my laptop is looking pixelated. Is it because both displays are at different
 size %? These settings are showing recommended if i have to use both screens. Is there any way to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Lost my account and now only in temp account with no files.</h2>
                    <p>so i got logged into a temp account so i used this article to help me.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947242</p>
<p>Basically just deleted the SID.bak folder in the registry editor. </p>
<p>however after i restarted the computer it tried to set up again but the screen was totally black? Ctr Alt Delete and sign out and back in and i am right back where i started. However before the reboot my profile image path in the registry was just straight
 to Users\WILL.LAPTOP</p>
<p>But now it reads USERS\WILL.LAPTOP-L2GQAB4F. And this code at the end is also on my temp profile image path for this account i am currently on but it has .000 afterwards.
</p>
<p>Please help </p>

                    <p>Multiple VSS writers are failing and my backups are failling too. Need help:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one desltop installed XP SP3 x64&nbsp; and one laptop with Seven SP1 x64. In both the machine my backups are failing. I am trying to back up data using Storage Craft, Windows backup is also failling. I am trying to take complete backup to an extarnal USB
 drive (2TB).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did "vssadmin list writers" and it showing multiple writers are at failed state.</p>
<p>I have done SFC /ScanNow, it did not help. There is no error in the disk and CHKDSK passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do&nbsp; not know how VSS works and how to troubleshoot the issue. Please help !!</p>

</p>
<p>Very often we come across issues, in which the VSS Writers keep failing after two or three backups. It may be a single VSS Writer or many of them from the list we get on running "vssadmin list writers".
<br />
I have been analyzing some tasks and have found that in cases where after updating the drivers for VSS, deleting the Subscriptions key and re-registering the DLL's, if we still find that the VSS writers fail, then it is not the writers which are at fault. It
 is the Providers. <br />
<br />
First let us understand some background of VSS.<br />
<br />
Background data on VSS<br />
======================<br />
<br />
Snapshot:- This is a point in time copy (shadow copy) of a volume.<br />
<br />
There are 3 important components involved in a snapshot creation.<br />
<br />
1. Volume Shadow Copy Service<br />
2. VSS Writers<br />
3. VSS Providers<br />
4. File System<br />
<br />
Volume Shadow Copy Service - (volsnap.sys)<br />
==========================<br />
<br />
This is the service which helps in co-ordination ( communication between the OS, the VSS writers, the VSS providers ). The point to note is that VSS ( Volume Shadow Copy Service ) DOES NOT TAKE SNAPSHOTS as we all assume it does. It just helps other components
 ( Writers, Providers &amp; OS ) communicate with each other effectively. Any transaction has to go through this service.
<br />
<br />
VSS Writers <br />
===========<br />
<br />
On a Server, we have a database for everything. For example, on a clean installed system, we have a database for the Registry, System, DCOM etc... everything that comes along with the OS.
<br />
<br />
If we add SQL to the server, then a database for SQL is created.<br />
<br />
If we further add Exchange, database for Exchange is created. <br />
<br />
VSS Writers are the ones who prepare the database for a snapshot ( shadow copy creation ). Again, VSS Writers do not take snapshots. They just prepare the database for a snapshot creation.
<br />
<br />
For example, there could be open transactions for Exchange, SQL, Registry, DCOM etc..
<br />
If we take a snapshot without preparing them first, the snapshot might be corrupt due to open transactions. For a perfect snapshot, these open transactions have to be closed first. The data in memory has to be flushed and further transaction have to stopped
 before a snapshot creation can happen. <br />
<br />
This is achieved by VSS Writers. <br />
<br />
The OS comes with some default writers like Registry Writer, System Writer, COM+ Writer etc. Writers like Exchange, SQL, IIS are not preinstalled on the system.
<br />
<br />
The moment we install Exchange, SharePoint,IIS or SQL, their writers are also installed. It comes with the package of the individual component.<br />
<br />
So, the registry writer will flush everything in its own database and stop further transactions ( read/write operations in registry ) during a snapshot creation process.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Exchange Writers. This will also flush existing transactions ( read/write operations ) in its own Exchange database before a snapshot can be taken.
<br />
<br />
The writers will not interfere with each other as they are only responsible for their own database.<br />
<br />
VSS Providers<br />
=============<br />
<br />
Now, these are the ones responsible for taking a snapshot. It is the most important part of a shadow copy creation.<br />
<br />
By default, we always have the "Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider" also known as "swprv.dll" installed on the system.
<br />
<br />
If we add a backup program like StorageCraft, then a provider from StorageCraft named "StorageCraft Shadow Copy Provider" will be installed on top of the default provider and will be used as the default provider.<br />
<br />
Further if we add Symantec Backup Exec, then a provider from Symantec will also be installed on top of the other two and will be used as the default provider.<br />
<br />
Note: When we run the command "vssadmin list providers" - The one that comes up on the top of the list, is the one installed last, and is the one used by default.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, the providers may conflict or may malfunction. If the providers fail to do their job, it also affects the writers. It may cause the writers to fail too and generate event errors like Event id 8, 12298 in the event Viewer.
<br />
<br />
File System<br />
===========<br />
<br />
Also known as NTFS.sys is the most important part of an OS. Without a file system, nothing is possible. Further explanation not required for this. If you want to learn about file systems, please GOOGLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE INITIATE A BACKUP using VSS<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
1. We initiate a backup using a backup application.<br />
2. The request is sent to Volume Shadow Copy Service ( VSS ) or volsnap.sys<br />
3. The VSS informs the respective writers that a snapshot creation is going to happen, so they must flush everything and freeze their databases for a a few seconds. The maximum time VSS writers can freeze their databases is for 60 seconds.<br />
4. Once the VSS writers complete their job ( have flushed and freezed the database ), it informs Volume Shadow Copy Service ( VSS ), that they are ready now.<br />
5. The VSS then informs the providers to take a snapshot. A snapshot is taken which takes a maximum of 10 secs. Once a snapshot is taken, it informs VSS that its job is done.
<br />
6. Then the VSS informs the VSS writers that a snapshot has been taken and that they can release the database.
<br />
7. Everything comes back to normal and the backup operation is started using the snapshot taken.<br />
<br />
<br />
TROUBLESHOOTING WITH VSS<br />
========================<br />
<br />
In case of a backup failure, we must first check the drivers associated with the VSS backup. These drivers are :<br />
<br />
1. Volume Shadow Copy service ( volsnap.sys )<br />
<br />
XP, Server 2003, Server 2003 R2 and SBS 2003 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/979457<br />
<br />
Vista, Server 2008 and SBS 2008 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976329, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2280117<br />
<br />
Seven, Server 2008 R2 and SBS 2011 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505454, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980082/EN-US<br />
<br />
2. NT File System ( NTFS.sys )<br />
<br />
XP, Server 2003, Server 2003 R2 and SBS 2003 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973870<br />
<br />
Vista, Server 2008 and SBS 2008 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972135, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2525064<br />
<br />
Seven, Server 2008 R2 and SBS 2011 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981208<br />
<br />
3. The Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider ( swprv.dll )<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975928; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971394<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976461<br />
<br />
If we have other providers installed, which could be StorageCraft provider, Symantec providers and Acronis Providers, we need to make sure that their files are also updated.
<br />
Some of them we commonly find are <br />
<br />
stcvsm.sys <br />
symsnap.sys<br />
snapman.sys<br />
<br />
Others may also be there and we need to search it out. Your best friend GOOGLE, please use it.<br />
<br />
PHASE 2<br />
--------<br />
<br />
This step is performed only when we find the VSS writers in a failed state. If we find the writers stable and still backups fail, or we get errors, please do not perform this step.<br />
<br />
In case, the VSS writers fail, we may delete the following registry key, after of course backing it up and reboot the server.
<br />
<br />
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/EventSystem/{26c....../Subscriptions. <br />
<br />
This key will automatically be re created on restart and writers should come back in stable state. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Writers in Waiting for completion state is not a problem. This is as good as Stable.<br />
<br />
We can do this on Server XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, Seven and 2008 R2 OS. <br />
<br />
One more thing to note. If we have only a single writer in a failed state, which would always be either SQL, EXchange, IIS or NTDS, then we need to restart their respective service from Service Console.
<br />
If they fail repeatedly, then make sure that the application and its components are updated. Consult their respective engineers once. Make sure that the latest service packs and rollups are installed.<br />
<br />
In case of NTDS writer failure in Server 2008, we may install : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970770<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, please inform your TL and engage a Setup/Perf engineer. You may need to create a task and assign to Setup/Perf bin.<br />
In this case we will have to enable VSS trace and check out further.<br />
<br />
Note: After deleting the Subscriptions key and rebooting, the subscriptions key is back in registry. However when we do, vssadmin list writers, nothing may be listed. In this case we register the VSS dll files.
<br />
<br />
For the list of dll files to register please check KB : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940184<br />
<br />
DLL registration has to be done only on Server 2003. PLEASE DO NOT REGISTER DLL FILES IN VISTA, 2008 and above. They might break other components.<br />
<br />
PHASE 3<br />
=======<br />
<br />
Doing the above two, would generally resolve 80-90 % of the issues. If we find that the issue is re occurring, or we have VSS event errors, it may be the providers causing the issue. If the snapshot creation does not happen properly, it may affect the writers
 and other components involved.<br />
<br />
Please check the providers using vssadmin list providers. If we find any other provider, other than Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider, we need to remove it from the list.<br />
<br />
To do this: Start registry editor.<br />
<br />
HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/VSS/Providers/GUIDS.<br />
<br />
One of the GUIDS would be for Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider. The other GUIDs would be for other providers like StorageCraft.
<br />
We will backup the GUID and then delete it. Then reboot the machine.<br />
Now when we do vssadmin list providers, we will only see the default Microsoft provider.
<br />
<br />
I have seen in many cases where our StorageCraft provider does not work properly and continue to fail the writers. In such cases, if we get rid of the provider, then the issue is resolved and does not re occur.
<br />
<br />
PHASE 4<br />
=======<br />
<br />
Please also check that we have abundant free space. If we go by the book, a snapshot requires at least 10 % of the volume to be free.<br />
The storage controllers ( SCSI/RAID controllers ) could also be an issue and may need to be updated.<br />
Run a chkdsk and make sure the volumes are error free.<br />
Evaulate the event viewer and search for errors. They might help. <br />
<br />
Again, if we find any errors, GOOGLE it.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;So many people has informed me that, they found this article informative. Hence I have improved that and posting back again.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br />
Before you stat working on this issue make sure that the volumes do not have disk/file-system error. Run CHKDSK and make sure.</p>
<p><br />
1) In case of a&nbsp;backup/writer failure, we must first check the drivers associated with the VSS backup.</p>
<p>These drivers are:</p>
<p>VOLSNAP.SYS</p>
<p>NTFS.SYS</p>
<p>SWPRV.DLL</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- Check the version of above mentioned 3 MS files, and update using MS Hotfix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we have other providers installed, which could be StorageCraft provider, Symantec providers and Acronis Providers, we need to make sure that their files are also updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You can see the list of providers using this command:&nbsp; VSSADMIN LIST PROVIDERS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of&nbsp;PROVIDER DRIVERS&nbsp;commonly find are:</p>
<p>stcvsm.sys</p>
<p>symsnap.sys</p>
<p>snapman.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) This step is performed only when we find the </p>
<p>VSS writers in a failed state. If we find the writers stable and still backups fail, or we get errors, please do not perform this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case, the VSS writers fail, we may delete the following registry key, after of course backing it up and reboot the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM/Software/Microsoft/EventSystem/{26c....../Subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This key will automatically be re-created on restart and writers should come back in stable state.</p>
<p>Writers in Waiting for completion state is not a problem. This is as good as Stable.</p>
<p><br />
We can do this on Server 2003, 2008 and 2008 R2 OS as well.</p>
<p><br />
However in Windows Server 2003, after deleting and restarting the server "vssadmin list writers" might not show all writers, in that case we need to register the DLLs:</p>
<p>For the list of dll files to register please check KB : <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940184</a></p>
<p><br />
<p><br />
3) If we have only a/specificwriter(s) in a failed state, which would always be either SQL, EXchange, IIS or NTDS, then we need to restart their respective service from Service Console.</p>
<p>If they fail repeatedly, then make sure that the application and its components are updated. Consult their respective engineers once. Make sure that the latest service packs and roll-ups are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Doing the above , would generally resolve 80-90 % of the issues. If we find that the issue is re occurring, or we have VSS event errors, it may be the providers causing the issue. If the snapshot creation does not happen properly, it may affect the writers
 and other components involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the providers using "vssadmin list providers". If we find any other provider, other than Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider, we need to remove it from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this: Start registry editor.</p>
<p>HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/VSS/Providers/GUIDS.</p>
<p>One of the GUIDS would be for Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider. The other GUIDs would be for other providers like StorageCraft. We will backup the GUID and then delete it. Then reboot the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when we do vssadmin list providers, we will only see the default Microsoft provider.</p>
<p>I have seen in many cases where our StorageCraft provider does not work properly and continue to fail the writers. In such</p>
<p>cases, if we get rid of the provider, then the issue is resolved and does not re occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- However doing these would hamper the functionality of StoaregCraft or any other backup software similar to this.</p>
<p>Hence engage respective Software tech/support for further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) If a Shadow Copy is enabled on the volumes, make sure that the Storage Area is set to the default location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example:</p>
<p>If we are taking a snapshot of C: then the storage area should be C:</p>
<p>We change this only if we do not have sufficient free space ( At least 300 MB ) free.</p>
<p>We can right click the volume, goto the Shadow Copy tab and change this accordingly.</p>
<p>Also note that the Storage Area minimum value should be 300 MB and maximum can be 3000 MB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can also put any value in between, which is a multiple of 300, like 600, 900, 1200, 1500 etc... depending upon the space available.</p>
<p>In case we find errors in the Event viewer about Time-Outs ( Event id : 12298, 12310, 2004, 12290 ) then we also need to set the MinDiffArea in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/Volsnap</p>
<p>Right Side, New DWORD VALUE - "MinDiffAreaFileSize" - Modify and set the value in between "300-3000 MB" or any multiple</p>
<p>of 300 in between. Ideally we can set it to 3000 MB which works best if we have space.</p>

<p>to be free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The storage controllers ( SCSI/RAID controllers ) could also be an issue and may need to be updated.</p>

    <title>Surface freezes with Dish Anywhere App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhubers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface freezes with Dish Anywhere App</h2>
                    Is there a fix for the Dish Anywhere player that freezes?&nbsp; I was online with both Dish reps and Microsoft reps.&nbsp; None were able to solve the problem of the Dish Anywhere player going black then freezing everytime I try to play a show.&nbsp; This is something
 that has been true since the update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is the solution? (it's making me try to find another laptop to take on my business trips.&nbsp; That's pretty bad for a computer that costs as much as the Surface).

<h2>            I lost hours of work after a sudden unprompted update</h2>
                    <p>I was just curious if there was a way to recover my work. I assume windows 10 wouldn't just restart without asking me unless it backed up my work somewhere. Or is it safer to just disable updates altogether?</p>

<p>Today (17th May) the updates cut in unexpectedly on 3 of our computers.&nbsp; There was no option to pause or stop this action. Our Group Policy is to NOT apply updates during working hours (8am-4:30pm, apparently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time it happened to us like this.&nbsp; It follows the install of the latest Window 10 update last week.</p>
