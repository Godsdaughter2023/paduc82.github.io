    <title>poor screen visibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmgc  say:</h3>
<h2>            poor screen visibility</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron One 2020 and the screen visibility is extremely poor.&nbsp; I'm not sure what happened to cause this.&nbsp; I have run all sorts of diagnostic tests on the system and everything comes back fine.&nbsp; The computer is running well, I just cannot
 see what is on the screen.&nbsp; This computer is an all in one model and the only adjustments I can manually make on the monitor are for brightness.&nbsp; It seems like that would be the issue, but adjusting that does not help.&nbsp; For a while, I was able to do CTRL-Alt-*
 and the screen would at least appear darker so that I could see the icons and words, but that doesn't work any longer.&nbsp; I am at a complete loss and am very frustrated that I cannot find any sort of information on what to do.&nbsp; I have researched restoring my
 computer to factory default settings, but am worried that I'm going to wreck my system.&nbsp; Any advice?

            <p>Not really sure what to suggest. Are you sure the monitor hasn't failed?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some PCs can control brightness from their function keys. On mine its &lt;fn&gt; and &lt;cursor up&gt; or &lt;cursor down&gt; to adjust brightness. Check to see if yours has similar options and the brightness is not set to minimum if it has.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are there any controls for brightness/contrast in the graphics/screen control functionality?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have a read of this - <a href="https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/quick-way-switch-high-contrast-themes-windows-7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/quick-way-switch-high-contrast-themes-windows-7.htm</a> to see if you can switch to a high contrast theme to see if that helps (at least temporarily).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try downloading a "live linux", burning to a CD/DVD and booting from that. Assuming it runs, It should then help you decide if your W7 is corrupted or the monitor/hardware has failed in some way. Puppy is probably as good as any -
<a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/cd-puppy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.puppylinux.com/cd-puppy.htm</a> Remember DO NOT INSTAL IT, download, burn to a CD/DVD and boot from that as a test.</p>
<p>If not puppy then ubuntu maybe - <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD</a> again DO NOT INSTALL IT, just run as a bootable livecd or live USB. This should enable you to test your hardware.</p>

    <title>Program &#34;Failed To Install&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam456732  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program &#34;Failed To Install&#34;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have a program on my computer called "Discord." It was recently working till I logged in to my computer and there was an update and it failed to update. So I went into the file of the program and changed the nickname of the "Update.exe" file
 by accident which messed up the archives of the files in the program... So after trying to completely uninstall the program and all its files I am still having a problem with the program and when I try starting the program I get a error message saying the
 installation has fail and an option to check the setup log for more information. When opening the set up log I get a file called "SquirrelSetup.log" and have a whole page in notepad filled with a bunch of words. Any help on how I can fix this would be much
 appreciated. Thank you </span></span></p>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may occur if the application is not properly installed on your system. With that said, to troubleshoot your concern, we recommend that you perform a clean reinstall of the said program. If you don’t have the setup file,
 we suggest that you visit their website and download the program. Performing this method recreates the necessary registry entries, plus
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">any subsidiary files that the unsuccessful uninstall may have messed up.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may perform a system restore. <span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates
 installed after the restore point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>

<h3> gepgep  say:</h3>
<h2>            BLACK SCREEN WHEN WINDOWS 10 IS ALMOST FINISHED UPDATING</h2>
                    <p>unlike the other questions, the cursor does not appear during the black screen, and ctrl alt del does nothing as well as the winkey-.... and other commands. after a while of black screen, it restarts and restores previous os.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im upgrading with a HP pavilion dv4 3107tx laptop with win7 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to avoid this kind of black screen? or a way to show the cursor so i can do the fixes provided in other questions? this has happened twice already and reverts back to win7. thank you.</p>

            My camera is doing the same thing! I checked for updates, I made sure it's license was synced, and re-installed it. I also ran the trouble shoot thing and it came up with nothing. But everything else of mine is working (video, game apps, etc.).

            <p>Same problem here.&nbsp;Camera App error&nbsp;on a clean Windows 8 installation on Dell Inspiron laptop. The app was working perfectly since September. It stopped working a few weeks ago. I can't remember if that was after installing updates - it could be. Same error
 message: "Sorry. The&nbsp;Camera app cannot be used with this version of Windows."&nbsp;As if&nbsp;it can be used with another one...
</p>
<p><br />
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the App with no help. Also run the app troubleshooter - which, for some reason, is not in the Control Panel with the rest of them and needs downloading from a random Microsoft website. The only thing I haven't tried
 so far is performing a clean boot (disabling all startup entries) to locate a possible conflict. I'll post back if that works.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know about the video app because I have uninstalled it. I use 99% of the time the desktop apps.

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I figured it out. I guess the developers were too stupid when trying to create the online pass
<strong>with</strong> U-play that they forgot to change the codes to 25 digits. So they actually had to make the online pass free to purchase on the marketplace xD</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">So if anyone else has this issue just choose purchase code, its free now.<br />

<p>No there's loads of different kinds of missions. There are stunt missions where you have to drift, drive in to oncoming traffic, jump a certain distance. There are chases where you have to either get away from the cops or stop the getaway. Races and many
 other types that I can't think iof right now... </p>
<p>The online multiplayer is fun too.</p>
<p>The shift mode also puts a unique spin on the whole thing</p>

<p>Are all the missions time based like in the demo ?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>The time limit was only put in the demo to ensure people didn't spend too long messing around in the demo instead of buying the game, from what I can tell. The Dares are often time-based, but that makes sense because they're challenges (eg. Pass 30 cars
 in 60 seconds) or something along those lines. From what I'm aware, the reason the Driver: San Francisco online pass was killed was because it was so badly butchered. When you start the game for the first time you can choose the 48-Hour Trial. Instead of being
 told you have 48 hours the window will tell you that you have 999 hours. I suggest 'buying' the Online Pass for the game (it's free), because then the window to let you know how many hours you have will go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver was one of the more fun games I've played this year. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the Burnout games and other more arcade-y racers.</p>

<p>Thanks Crank and Paul for your answers. I loved previous Driver games but i didn't buy it for the time based missions in the demo. Now that you both explained how the game really works ; i am again interested.</p>

<p>Are you still able to make the changes in spite of the error message? If yes, this is a common occurrence when you have an older HP printer installed and you can safely ignore the error. If you can't make the changes and/or don't have an HP printer, please
 start with the basics and post back with results for more help.</p>
<p>The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 and the death of my Lenovo laptop</h2>
                    <p>On Aug. 1st I upgraded to Windows 10 from Win7 on my 2011 Lenovo laptop. My computer froze. Then my techie husband took over and tried again. My Lenovo froze. My husband was able to un-install Win 10 and re-install Win 7. We decided to wait to try again
 to let Microsoft work out the bugs in Win 10. At the beginning of September my husband installed Win10 on his Samsung laptop without a problem. Then he tried to install Win10 on the Lenovo again. The computer did not freeze after this attempt but I could no
 longer save Notepad documents. A message would appear saying: "Notepad has stopped working". After trying to un-install Win10 on the Lenovo unsuccessfully, my husband started a chat with Microsoft Customer Support on the free Answer Desk. After
<em>four</em> hours on the chat and having Answer Tech&nbsp;<span>Justine Cabel take over the Lenovo, there was still a problem with Win 10 on the Lenovo (</span><span>service
 request number: 1303244423)</span><span><span>. On Sept. 4th we again contacted Customer Support and an Answer Tech took over the Lenovo again. After
<em>another four </em>hours we were assured the problems on the Lenovo had been solved. We checked and thought that they were. But after we ended the chat, the problems were still there and we could not un-install Win10. We contacted Lenovo, spent $70 and their
 support&nbsp;</span><span>diagnostics said that "we had corrupted the Lenovo's hard disc." At that point we gave up and bought a new laptop with Win 10 already installed.</span><span>&nbsp;We really, really hope that someone
 at Microsoft reads this and contacts us. It has been an expensive and time-consuming process to upgrade with the free software. BTW, I did not get to respond to the Microsoft survey request on how rated the Answer Tech's performance before the time to take
 the Microsoft survey "expired".</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Felix, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>HDMI cables do support audio signals, but not all HDMI-enabled video cards support audio. If your HDTV has an audio input, you might be able to connect a separate audio cable from your computer's sound card directly to the TV. Otherwise, you'll need to connect
 the audio signal to a different output device, such as external computer speakers or your home stereo system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default Windows does not route sound over the HDMI output. To change this we need to change the settings in control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This will turn off sound from the speakers or normal audio output on the laptop. To get that back you will have to reverse this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a)</strong> Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +<strong> X </strong><br />
<strong>b)</strong> Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong><br />
<strong>c)</strong> With the Control Panel in Control Panel Home view please click on Hardware and Sound<br />
<strong>d)</strong> Where it says <strong>"Sound"</strong> in green letters there are three options below that are in blue click on "<strong>Manage Audio Devices</strong>"<br />
<strong>e)</strong> This will bring up a window labeled <strong>"Sound"</strong><br />
<strong>f)</strong> On the <strong>"Playback"</strong> tab there is listed the sound options available to you. One should read "<strong>Digital Output Device (HDMI)</strong>" Click on that.<br />
<strong>g)</strong> There should now be a check mark on that option, make HDMI sound output as default .<br />
<strong>h)</strong> The Sound should then play through your HDMI hookups to the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

</p><p><span><span>As the issue still persists, I suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Perform Clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows
 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer
 to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, try method 2.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Download the media creation tool to install windows 10 and create Windows 10 installation DVD media and try Repairing
 your Computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Create installation media for windows 10.</span></p>

    <title>Login box takes a long time to appear - Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyburnash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login box takes a long time to appear - Win 10</h2>
                    <p>When turning on my computer- every time since as long as I can remember (though I don't think this happened when I first got it) - the text box that I enter my computer password into to login - takes an enormous amount of time to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like- it will turn on just fine, the Login screen appears, and everything except for the text box itself appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't just take a long time either. It just plain doesn't show up unless I spam keyboard buttons. Eventually it just kind of seems to decide to respond and the text box appears and works fine. It's really strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, this may or may not be related, but as of late (possibly started around the same time), my mouse acts very strange on startup. Until a minute or two&nbsp;<em>after</em> I'm already logged in, it just doesn't work right. Usually it just moves incredibly
 slow and clicking only sometimes works. The last few times I turned on my computer, it instead decided to only move up or down (not left or right) until it was fully logged in and booted. It's as if the mouse drivers aren't loading unless I've fully logged
 on or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two issues might not be related, but a solution to either one would be fantastic</p>

<p>Someone in another thread mentioned that they narrowed it down to a service called 'DeviceAssociationService.' Though where they said enabling it fixed the problem, mine was already enabled. I disabled it and tried rebooting and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who knows if it will work in the future, but for now it might have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to it: hit start and look for services. Then in the services dialogue, just look for DeviceAssociationService, hit properties, and set it to 'disabled.'</p>

<h2>            Installed wrong version of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>An automatic windows update made my system crash completely (error code "0xc000000d"). I created a new installation media on a USB but by mistake installed Windows 10 PRO instead of the Home version i had on my system. I am now unable to activate the software
 as my licence specifies the Home version. I can not find any way to correct this mistake, when trying to reinstall it now assumes it is the PRO version I have and that I want to reinstall. Very grateful for any advice! I hate having to pay for a product I
 already bought, especially since this mess was entirely caused by MS non-functioning automatic updates!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kris.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you get into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>?  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> which will always find and fix the problem or reinstall WIndows to a much better and more stable configuration.
<br /> 
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.
<br />
<br />If Windows will not start and run, I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>

<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br />

    <title>Naked Photos On My NEW Surface Pro 4... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hannahpulver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Naked Photos On My NEW Surface Pro 4...</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I am new to this community and am glad that I can reach out to everyone who will have more experience with Microsoft than I do. A few weeks ago, I purchased the surface pro 4 as a bundle pack through the Microsoft website. Once I received the device
 and began setting up my accounts, I noticed some things that should not be on it.. When I clicked on file explorer, onedrive, and then to pictures - there was a folder containing approximately 20 photos of a random woman. (half of whom were ****!) I was freaked
 out and decided to just delete the pictures. I didn't think much of at first but now I'm beginning to be suspicious of my device. Not to mention it makes me very skeptical of using the onedrive now that it doesn't seem&nbsp;secure at all.. Additionally, I have
 maybe used it not even a dozen times now. I have only downloaded some popular applications. I am now having issues where my screen blacks out randomly. I have to more the finger pad around to get the screen back on. I am not happy about that. Does anyone have
 any insight/advice to what's&nbsp;going on&nbsp;with my pro? I don't appreciate these problems considering I paid $1,200 on a computer/tablet that I was very excited about. On the other hand, I am very happy with everything else!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much and I appreciate any feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Hannah</p>

    <title>External DVD not working Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External DVD not working Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice on the following please. I have both a tablet and laptop that are running Windows 10 however when I attach an external DVD player to either of them it won't work. It is recognised by both machines as it's showing
 the content of the disc in file explorer, the light is flashing and I can hear the disc rotating, it just wont play. Perhaps it could be that the player is not compatible with Windows 10 as it is a few years old and I could contact the manufacturers to see
 what they have to say however I thought I'd ask on here first just in case a similar problem has been solved previously. Many thanks, any advice greatly appreciated</p>

<h3> soccernut  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Don&#39;t show again for this site&#34; not working like I would expect on IE 10</h2>
                    <p>[** Note to Forum Administrator:&nbsp; Sorry if I have&nbsp;posted&nbsp;this question to the&nbsp;wrong Forum, but it seemed like the closest to what I'm asking.&nbsp; Fee free to move it to another Windows Store [apps] Forum if necessary. **]</p>
<p>I have a HTML5 with JavaScript page that contains an activeX control so it needs to run on IE 10 in the "desktop" environment.&nbsp; The top of my HTML file is shown here</p>
<p><span>        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span><span>&lt;!-- HTML5 --&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>        &lt;html&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>        &lt;head&gt;</span><span>
	        </span><span>&lt;meta</span><span> </span><span>charset</span><span>=</span><span>"ISO-8859-1"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
	        </span><span>&lt;meta</span><span> </span><span>http-equiv</span><span>=</span><span>"X-UA-Compatible"</span><span> </span><span>content</span><span>=</span><span>"requiresActiveX=true"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span></p><p><span>        ...</span></p>
<p>The key here is the "Meta" tag containing "requiresActiveX=true".&nbsp; When this page is displayed for the first time in the Windows Store (formerly Metro) environment I get the message&nbsp;at the bottom of my display with the 3 options: "Open", "Don't show again
 for this site", and "Close".&nbsp; If I select "Open" the web page is properly opened/redisplayed in the "desktop" environment.&nbsp; No problems so far.&nbsp; ("Close" simply aborts any attempt to switch to the desktop.)&nbsp; However, if I select the "Don't show again for this
 site" option, the only affect seems to be that the popup message doesn't get shown again in the&nbsp;future .&nbsp; Unfortunately, the switch to the "desktop" environment doesn't automatically occur.</p>
<p>So, here's my question:&nbsp; The *only* way to get my web page that contains activeX controls to switch to the "desktop" appears to be to have the above message displayed and then select the "Open" option.&nbsp; Is this correct, or is there possibly alternative way?</p>
<p>At least for now I have to run my web page on the desktop because I don't have access to the required hardware when running in Windows Store environment.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span>It is a pleasure to assist you. The question you had was if there was an alternative way to open the programs
 which uses Active X in Modern UI Internet Explorer. </span></p>
<p><span>When you try to open the programs in Modern UI Internet Explorer which has to be opened with the ActiveX It
 will open in Desktop Internet Explorer as it is designed that way. You are opening in the correct way.</span></p>

            <p>Niyamath,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back with me regarding me question.&nbsp; You answer isn't exactly what I was looking for but I think we're getting closer.&nbsp; I'll detail my follow-up questions here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First, if select the "Don't show again for this site" option when presented in the Modern UI Internet Explorer environment, what is supposed to happen?&nbsp; Should it simply close the message at the bottom of the screen and *not* open the page in the "Desktop
 Internet Explorer"?&nbsp; Or&nbsp;should it close the message and switch to the desktop.&nbsp; This later scenario is ideally what I'm looking for.<br />
</li><li>Then once the user selects the "Don't show again for this site" option, what happens when this same web page/site is displayed again (for the second and subsequent times)?&nbsp; In my case after selecting this option&nbsp;and the page is opened a second (and subsequent)
 time it does *not* switch to the Desktop Internet Explorer.&nbsp; My users are stuck at this point and the only way to resolve the problem seems to go into the registry and remove the appropriate web site from the ".../Software/Microsoft/Internet Explorer/ Main/DisableRequiresActiveXPrompt"
 entry.&nbsp; This is unacceptable to my users.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I possibly missing something in my HTML / JavaScript code here?&nbsp; I also seem to remember that this behavior was different in earlier versions of Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm running Windows 8 RTM, Build 9200 with all the latest "Windows updates installed on my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks you for valuable time assisting me with this critical issue for the future success of our product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. You don't know when you purchased the Dell computer, not even a guess, is that correct?

2. Can you start the computer in Safe Mode, with or without networking? [1]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

COMMENT: Chances are (99.99%) the Dell computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it. Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.

PS: If it was a used/refurbished computer when you bought it, all bets are off. Your best bet in that case would be formatting the HDD then doing a clean install of Windows (7 or 10).

            Try aborting the Reset, or hold the power button until it powers off.  Wait 30 minutes.

Power back on to see if it will roll back or continue.  

If not you can do a Clean Install with the media provided here:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587

Since you need to make the bootable media to Clean Install anyway, you can also first boot into Repair Your Computer link on the second screen to attempt to Reset from the booted media which may be more stable.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

You might also be able to run Factory Recovery to Windows 7 if it's still on the drive, then either leave it at Windows 7, or install Media Creation Tool to choose Upgrade Now to Windows 10.    http://www.w7forums.com/windows-7-recovery-partition-t4534.html

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep

<h2>            My Windows 10 machine keeps rebooting. Why&#63; I checked event logs and a quick search says to ignore the error logs. Frustrating&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Pardon me, as I am trying to restrain myself. It is just beyond annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Random programs, random times......computer just reboots. Luckily, web browsers can restore links and most of the programs I use have save points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But waiting 2 minutes for my computer to reboot is not enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did add new RAM recently. BUT, I cannot ensure that was the cause. If memory serves me right, it happened before I added that. I do have a AMD system, and I removed a troublesome Windows update. But alas, still happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If error logs cant help, is there any other place to find out what happened at the time it happened?? Help.&nbsp;</p>

            Have you looked in Event Viewer?
<br />
<br />Start menu and typing eventvwr and pressing enter? 
<br />
<br />Click on Windows Logs  look in both the Application and System sections.
<br />
<br />Do you see any errors in there?
<br />
<br />Also, do you know what version you are running. You can check your version of Windows by by right clicking the Start Menu icon and clicking System. 
<br />
<br />You will see a field called version. What do you have in there?

<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers apart from the RAM since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?

            I know there has been a lot of issues with 1709, when did the issues start? You may need to rollback Windows 10 to before 1709. But if this started before the 1709 update, then this shouldn't apply. Let me know, below are instructions in case you want to try rolling this back. 
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings and click on Update &amp; Security. 
<br />
<br />Click the Recovery link on the left and then click on Get started under 'Go back to the previous version of Windows 10.'

            Hi Dave.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Restart the PC then check again.
<br />
<br />Run Crucial System Scanner to see if it finds and confirms the specs on the RAM you bought, as it is the most reliable RAM finder there is and will show you your exact specs and what is presently installed and in what configuration.
<br />
<br />If that confirms the RAM is spec'd precisely (as it must always be) then test the RAM overnight to stress it, using this bootable test which is the only one that matters and which will show you how to test both sticks and slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />You said you removed Windows Updates.  Were they hidden so that they're not being reinstalled?  See this guide:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />What was the problem exactly with the faulty update(s)?
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />
<span>Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10? unsure why. I guess I could double check the GPU web site.&nbsp;</span><br />

            I guess it really comes down to when the issues started, if it was before the RAM was installed then it might be more of a software issue. It definitely won't hurt to try re-seating the RAM.  It could also be bad RAM, how many sticks do you have? If you have more than one, try running without one of them and see if the issue persists. If it is still having the issue, try putting that stick back in and taking the other out. This way we can isolate a possible faulty stick of RAM.

<p>I suspect youre right Justin. I am pretty meticulous about how I monitor these things, but i never wrote anything down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it "could" be the ram, and that I was just lucky for a month or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And therein lies the problem. I will try to use just one stick of RAM and wait a couple days to see if that happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which, now that I think about it....these reboots seem to happen when a lot of what could be considered RAM intensive things are happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I was working in Photoshop one time with a lot of layers and it seemed to be working pretty hard, but of course, I cant very that because I didnt have the task manager system diag screen up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah well. I may have to try one or two of these things, and then wait a day or 2 to see if it remains stable. It's unfortunately THAT random.&nbsp;</p>
