<h2>            2 users with the same name on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I know this is impossible, but it's true.</p>
<p>When the PC boots up it only shows a flower icon with the user Doreen.</p>
<p>When you log in it's the wrong account, so I sign out. It then shows 4 accounts one is Doreen with her picture, this is the correct account.</p>
<p>I can't get Windows 7 to automaticly log onto her account as it always chooses the wrong one.</p>
<p>In settings there is only the correct Doreen shown.</p>
<p>How can I either get the PC to log onto her account at boot up or delete the wrong account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

    <title>Skype split screen on IPad Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andycook2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype split screen on IPad Pro</h2>
                    I have an Ipad pro and use Skype to teach online English lessons. &nbsp;Unfortunately when I put Skype in a split screen with an online student lesson record the Skype app gives me a message that the camera is disabled in Split screen mode. &nbsp;I don’t understand
 this because I am only using the camera and speakers for Skype and reading the student record from a website. &nbsp;Is there any way to enable the camera while in split screen mode? &nbsp;What is also strange is the speakers and conversation continues in split screen
 mode but only the camera is disabled

    <title>Start menu not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simoncairns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 about a month ago, and I am now beginning to think it was one of the worst decisions I ever made! None of the windows apps work properly - photo app can't pick up items in my folders, similarly the music app can't
 see my music folder and now to top it off, the start menu has stopped working. I didn't get any error messages or anything like that - it just stopped. I've looked on line and followed som step by step instructions on accessing something called powershell
 and copying in some text before restarting. That worked once. I'm no tekkie, just an ordinary pc user who wants to get on with my life but find myself bogged down in stuff that should just work. Can anyone give me a real basic process to follow to put this
 right, does anyone know if this is ever going to get fixed officially or is my best option to try and go back to Windows 8.1 - if so how do I do that.
</p>
<p>Hoping someone with more pc knowledge than me can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

            Sorry just too technical for me. As I said I'm just an ordinary pc user who just expects things to work. Moving to Windows 10 is the worst move I ever made. Music app doesn't work, I can't get rid of the outlook.com email account that I don't use and have
 to sign in to my PCs which I never had to do before. It's just rubbish.

<p>Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I completely understand your concern and feel sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
1. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft user account?<br />
2. Have you installed all the pending updates on the PC?<br />
3. Did you make any changes to the PC, prior to this issue? </p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Do you get any&nbsp;exact error code or error message, while opening start menu?</p>
<p>5. Do you have any third party application, installed on your system? &nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the PC and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s try to refer to the link below and check, if the issue still persists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Sign in with a Microsoft account:</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the PC to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This issue may occur due to the corrupted Windows system files or due to the corrupted user account profile or due to any third party antivirus software installed on your system.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I suggest you to refer to the suggestions given by Sharath Srinivasa, replied on January 23, 2015, from the following link below and check, if it helps.

            Hi Paulo.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />

<h3> justinmessner  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 - unable to access any window relate programs after updating to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Good Evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you can please help me. I updated my windows to windows 10 last night and found that once the update was completed I was also unable to access any of my windows programs (start menu, notification center, windows update, etc). I can access
 all my third party programs fine (firefox, steam, skype), as well as my hard drive just fine but it seems none of my window programs worked. Also when I take a look at my c drive it looks like some of the window related folders are missing information (i.e.
 start menu folder is greyed out and when I try to open it I get a message stating 'C:\programdata\start menu is not accessible. Access is denied.'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely</p>
Justin

</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I understand how you feel about the situation. I suggest you some steps which can resolve your issue.</div>
<div><br />
Are you sure that the installation was complete?<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps below:</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> System File Checker <br />

Note: Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>If the issue still persist reset Windows update components.<br />
How do I reset Windows Update components?<br />

<h2>            Photo sending</h2>
                    <p>I have two questions for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I have two skype accounts and I had sent a photo from one of my accounts to the other one with my cell phone. My aim was to know whether a photo is deleted from the receiving account when it is deleted from the sending account. I had deleted the photo
 from my sending account and I saw that it is also deleted from the receiving account. But after sometime when I logged in my sending account from my pc, I saw that the photo was still there. I deleted it again, but it made me nervous. I am suspicious of a
 possible unauthorized log in to my account. what could be the reason that the photo was still there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - Is it possible to know whether someone has broken into my account illegally?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It's unusual that the photo you sent was not deleted on your end after successfully being removed. It should be removed from all of the devices where your account is signed on. But this is not an indication that someone else accessed your account, this problem
 might be caused by a delay on the deletion of the item from the conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check if there is any unusual activity on your account by reviewing your account's recent activity

            Hi thomas
<br />
<br />Somehow your Videos Folder must have been dragged onto your Desktop . . .
<br />
<br />When you deleted that, were you told the folder was too large for the Recycle Bin and then asked if you wanted to permanently delete it?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />

            Hi Thomas
<br />
<br />Yes your Videos folder had somehow ended up inside your Desktop Folder (see image below)
<br />
<br />If that folder was a substantial size, with many videos, and it is not in your Recycle Bin, I doubt that folder will be recoverable . . .
<br />
<br />You can use this method to move the videos folder location back to its original location . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Registry Editor, if you had already closed that, it should still be on the same page
<br />
<br />Double click My Video then set its value data to:
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Videos
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Then, do the same for the other item indicated in the image below:
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC . . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8c1bad4-745c-4bc7-b196-2f2432a83f00?upload=true" />

<h2>            How do I add money to my Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am just wondering how to add money to my Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>Basically, Saints Row 4 is going to be on sale for June 3rd to 9 for $11.99, and I will have enough from Bing Rewards this week to get $9 for it, along with $1.29 from my previous purchases. That would make $10.29 total, meaning I'm just a little less than
 two dollars away.</p>

<p>Is there any way to add that difference to my Microsoft Account? Or is there no way to do so? I've looked online, and everyone had said that there was no way, although those were made almost a year ago, and they could have changed it. I still see no option
 for it, though...</p>

<p>what you're looking for is a split transaction. to do it though you must have a card or paypal on the account, click on the item you want to buy and confirm the purchase a message should appear and say "Hey you have X amount on your MSA would you like to
 use that first?" yes than it will charge the rest on the card. But I usually prefer using currency anyways since it's a lot easier. Oh and yes do this on the console when you go to buy it.</p>

<br />2.Select Compatibility Tab.
<br />3.Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility Mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.

</p><p>Hi Angel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response; I followed the instructions provided, and Windows 10 still doesn't recognize my DVD drive.&nbsp; Btw, the latest driver download from Sony is quite old, in my opinion, as it was dated back to 2013.&nbsp; If there are other ways to fix this
 issue, please do advise.</p>

<h2>            driver for Microsoft Lifecam</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft lifecam VX 6000.&nbsp; This was working well with windows xp os. Now that Microsoft has orpaned Windows XP, Lifecam also is orphaned. It is not accepted by the Windows 10 os. Where can I get driver for making this lifecam work on windows 10.
 In an earlier response on similar issue, one Sujata Mokhtan has responded in Microsoft community , to download the driver for Windows 8 or 7 or xp&nbsp; from the manufacturer. Is this the end of life of the working product life cam vx6000. Looks like Microsoft
 want to punish the users of windows 7, xp users for having upgraded to windows 10.</p>

    <title>100&#37; Disk Usage in Windows 10 renders nice PC useless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmum76  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; Disk Usage in Windows 10 renders nice PC useless</h2>
                    <p>OK this one is direct for a Microsoft Engineer to reply and I mean reply with what Microsoft is going to do about this issue. I now have my Home and Work PC switched over to Windows 10. I did this by the way within 24-48 hours of its release in the upgrade
 push from Windows 7 in the system tray. I at first loved it, Really just loved it, I only&nbsp;found one issue that I resolved myself and also posted the fix under the Microsoft answers question for the issue. I thought wow I like this for almost a year.....&nbsp;So
 far so good Right?.....Wrong, A month or so ago I noticed my home PC started having the 100% disk usage issue and did some online searching and found the discussion but no real fix. This was on my home PC I do not use much so I thought ill just wait for the
 next update they will fix it......So still no fix and I almost just blamed it on Ram since I was not having this issue on my work PC that has 16gig of Ram vs the 4gig in my home laptop. Well now I am having the 100% disk usage issue on my work PC. Now let
 me be clear to Microsoft here when I say this is a real issue since I am the only one in my office out of over 50 users that did the upgrade to Windows 10 from 7 and have kind of been the Beta tester here for all the future PC's to determine how well the transition
 will go for the rest of the office. I was...WAS all for it and now I am not so sure at all. So now I ask what do I tell my IT department about the issue. I have had nothing but great things to say about this OS so far&nbsp;and now with this issue it all goes out
 the window if upgrading to Windows 10 makes our&nbsp;PC's useless. I have quite a big following on social media and have not yet made this issue viral and feel I&nbsp;almost have no choice. I now ask Microsoft and anyone in the community who cares to reassure me that
 the issue is all but fixed in the next update. Or I ask Microsoft to put out a specific update just for us with the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please,</p>
<p>Don't tell me to sign out, Sign back in and switch accounts I want a real answer. Seriously this ongoing issue with the new&nbsp;Windows OS's that never live up to their true potential is getting OLD. Windows XP is where I started and I feel the direction of
 progress is just going backwards, Simple things like the search in Windows XP can still not be matched by any OS since....Really.....Seriously. That's going backwards. It is supposed to get better. NOT WORSE, Windows Vista was a disaster and made me hate the
 idea of ever changing to it, Then Windows 7 came&nbsp;and I was like,&nbsp;OK here we go, This is better, I like this and I made the switch from XP to 7. Then Windows 8 comes out and&nbsp;was horrible from my experience on a friends laptop. Then I seen Windows 10 was coming
 out&nbsp;and from what I read and have now experienced over the past year I found it as a blend between all the best features of Windows XP, Windows 7 and the App/store introduction of Windows 8. So there you have it I finally thought nice Windows 10 is the $hit.
 I have been happy for almost a year now......And&nbsp;then this happens..... 100% Disk Usage BS</p>
<p>
</p><p>We as consumers and users of this software want a real answer and update&nbsp;to fix&nbsp;this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in advance for your concern in resolving this matter promptly,</p>
<p>JC</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. Sad part is no, it does not work in the UEFI either. Whenever rebooting the dialogue message prompts for Surface ME - Restart Needed to complete installation flashes. Doesn't matter whether you restart or not it does nothing. Same
 message, your computer needs to be restarted in order to finish setting up device. Looking in the Device Manager the message is "This device cannot start. (Code 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From looking around it sounds like i am not the only one with this. Thanks</p>

    <title>Go Back to windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Go Back to windows 8.1</h2>
                    I stupidly got the windows 10 upgrade on a new Lenova laptop, that was running windows 8.1. I found that many features didn't work and programs and apps just wouldn't work. I have tried to go back to win 8.1 as described in the how to section and I am
 left with a black screen and a dead computer. &nbsp;All I can get on it after restarting is a page that loads Avast Grime fighters, then it just goes to the black screen, and stays like that. I would like to fix this problem but don't know how, Some help here please.
 This was posted from an old laptop.

            <p>Hi Michele,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in&nbsp;Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are some programs and drivers that need new definitions compatible with Windows 10. Till the time they are unavailable you can install the programs compatible with previous versions of operating system in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround you can install the&nbsp;program in compatibility mode after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In this case, you can try t<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>o diagnose whether this issue occurs in

            <p>Thank you for answering, &nbsp;But my problem is , after going back to win 8.1, I got the black screen, and it now shows NOTHING. I can't get to boot in any mode, as the screen has nothing, not even a cursor. I will be mighty angry if my brand new laptop is now
 only good for a door stop, thanks to your programs that shouldn't be released until the bugs are fixed. I can't afford to lose everything on my laptop as I work from home. It has everything on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a fine example of, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Unfortunately, it is NOW broken. how do I fix it.</p>

            Hi there, I just read that you too have the problem That I had. There was no way I was going to pay a tech to "rebuild" my brand new lenovo laptop. (he wanted $330), so I bought it home with me again. I have an old laptop that I looked up lenovo on and
 found that it has a reset button on the side by the power cord. Who knew ?? any &nbsp;way I have fixed mine, so it might help you if I tell you what I did. I powered off, disconnected the internet connection, and pressed the little button on the side for about
 8 seconds until it powered up showing the Lenovo logo. As soon as that shows release the button and it should take you into Bios. There I selected the windows boot and I was back to windows 8.1 it was pretty easy considering I am not an it tech and it didn't
 cost me anything and lets face it, the computer was useless as it was, and everyone I tried wanted money to fix it. Microsoft was no help neither Lenovo. Shame really seeing as the laptops are not cheap throw away items. I hope this hel

            Appreciate your input.&nbsp; After my anger died down, I finally got the screen back through another reboot and was able to get to the people icon and followed the settings and found the revert back to windows 8 and got it going.&nbsp; Then....I panicked because
 it didn't seem my computer was going to work again - it took quite some time.&nbsp; After it sat there about an hour, I gave up and turned it off and then turned it back on and yay, my windows 8 was back and all my stuff that had disappeared.&nbsp; So glad to be back
 to the 8.&nbsp; Actually,&nbsp; I liked 7 better.&nbsp; Anyway, many thanks for your response.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which troubleshooting steps have you tried to resolve the issue?</li><li>Are you logged in as Administrator?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the Methods below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong>Many a times, non-Microsoft services or Drivers can interfere with the proper functioning of System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Try booting the system in Safe Mode and check the status of the issue.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services
 as possible causes. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Disable security software on the system.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Disable Antivirus and security-related products, if you have any Antivirus installed for (Free) uninstall it, if not then
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>disable the Antivirus, try again using the apps and check if issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> </span><span>Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>

<p>SSD Samsung 850</p>
<p>
</p><p>(stock or OC does not matter for the proposed problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A year ago I had the problem that my PC would not shut down - resulting in a clean installation that was guided by a senior advisor from this forum. Since then everything ran really well!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after installing Windows updates (I have an eye on KB4340917) something really bad happened. Windows UI, Chrome, FL studio and virtually all games suffer from tremendeous stuttering, everything just makes the impression of imploding. Scrolling is a stutterfest
 now no matter where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im speaking big stutters, those who **** the eyes a lot. Linux runs fine though, no stuttering! Also some games do not stutter, like SCP secret laboratory while others look like having the same problems, periodic stuttering&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not change even when switching graphics drivers (uninstalled trough DDU) to the current one windows is using, or the newest available. Chipset etc it'**** all updated. Virtually all firmware is updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am really hoping for a fix since stuttering on Windows 10 has gotten worse over the last months and was sometimes better with certain NVidia drivers etc now all of a sudden it'**** unbearable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The thing is, I cannot everytime a windows update breaks my PC do a complete clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please if you need a certain log or other information, I will make it available&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hit Ctrl+Shift+Escape and observe the 1st tab to see which program/process is hogging your system resources like disk or CPU.&nbsp; That will tell you at least what is causing the lag and we can take it from there to fix/solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a system is working properly, your CPU and Disk on that tab should be nearly zero, even if you have dozens/hundreds of programs open.&nbsp; For example, here's mine as I type this:</p>

<p>the stuttering/twitches does/do not create any unusual CPU usage and the problem persists even in safe mode with an absolut minimal of services for instance while scrolling in a windows menue. (all of it after a windows update, tried uninstalling that too).
 Tried all the 'smooth scrolling' options aswell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My eyes begin to hurt so much :'(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you guys make some sort of tool that will generate fixes and repairs windows like the updates generate bugs and break windows? Something like this would dramatically increase my willingness to buy many more windows products, this should be noted! :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Task manager seems to be alright. Today some new Windows updates dropped but the 'slow scrolling stuttering' issue still persists. Thinking it might be the HDMI cable, I replaced it with a new gold standard one. To further describe the main issue: when holding
 Mouse Button 3 and scrolling with the lowest possible speed, it's super laggy/choppy/twitchy!&nbsp; Chrome and Firefox suffer the most from this which I use for comparison. Generally the windows UI is still laggy too, when moving windows etc even with all the performance
 options disabled in sysdm.cpl&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried changing the gaming mice with a regular logitech one, also on all USB slots on the mobo. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I checked for new SSD firmware and uninstalled almost anything I do not need for work or love the most. Installed all the drivers from my mobo manufacturer like Intel Management Engine etc too. Disabled page file aswell</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I had the correct beeps and boops - you got any idea?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good info.&nbsp; It could also be chipset or firmware.&nbsp; You might open Device Manager and make sure nothing is listed with a warning icon.</p>

            I've been experiencing the same exact issue since July 2018 on both of laptops (work and home).&nbsp; I've tried everything.&nbsp; I end up having to uninstall KB4343909 everytime. Now the numbering has changed...no longer KB4343909 installing but some other number
 which is what I have to uninstall every single time.&nbsp; My coworker is having the same issues.&nbsp; Lagging on chrome and on Windows File Explorer (although Windows Edge seems to be okay).&nbsp; Is this Microsoft's attempt to dissuade ppl from using Chrome?&nbsp; (although
 it's affecting Windows File Explorer).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Yeah trust me they don't want it to be annoying. Not even if you use Chrome.&nbsp; Heck, the huge overwhelming majority of their own developers and managers use Chrome, it's the most popular browser on earth right now (and incidentally most of their employees,
 even top executives -- and the CEO himself -- use iPhones too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can certainly be solved.&nbsp; The first thing we need to do is figure out what is causing it to lag so bad.&nbsp; In other words, what is hogging your CPU processing and making it so busy that it can't keep up?&nbsp; Even if you have hundreds and hundreds of programs
 open at once, unless they are actually processing data they shouldn't be using much CPU.&nbsp; In fact, I have more than 300 processes running right now and my CPU is only busy 5% of the time (meaning it's sitting idle with nothing to work on 95% of the time).&nbsp;
 That means there's no chance for lag because the processor has tons of extra capacity (screenshot below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, press Ctrl-Shift-Escape and look at yours.&nbsp; What is the CPU utilization?&nbsp; And similarly, look at the disk utilization.&nbsp; Because it is by far the slowest component, it can be the bottleneck.&nbsp; Even if the CPU isn't busy, the disk might not be able to supply

<p>Thanks for the input.&nbsp; Looks like it is CPU usage (see below).&nbsp; This is happening for multiple people at my company....so how do we fix?&nbsp; We're all running Acer machines...could that be the issue?</p>

            <p>According to the Desktop Assist website, it is not compatible with Windows 8.&nbsp; You might be able to fix this problem by right-clicking the Desktop Assist icon, choosing Properties, then using the
<em>Compatibility</em> tab to make it work.&nbsp; If that doesn't help, your next best bet is to contact them and let them know.&nbsp; Perhaps they have (or are working on) a new version that works with Windows 8.</p>

Change it in<br />Control Panel. Where in Control Panel to change it depends on what<br />version of Windows you are running, and you didn't tell us.
