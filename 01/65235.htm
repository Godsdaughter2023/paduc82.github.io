<h2>            Windows 8.1 Refresh No Disk</h2>
                    <p>I tried refreshing my windows 8.1 computer. At 98% i got a message saying cmd.exe No Disk, there is no disk in the drive. &nbsp;Since it is refreshing, I cannot close the window, therefore stalling the update.</p>
<p>I did insert a blank disc but it wont do anything.</p>

<p>During seasons matches my game quits saying I have lost connection to ea servers. Sometimes fine but has happened in over 40 matches now. What compensation is MS providing for selling faulty goods with your console. Other games are fine. Who do I contact
 in your legal department?</p>

<p>EA servers are renowned for being unrealiable.</p>
<p>Just because you are having disconnections doesn't necessarily means there is a problem with your xbox or connection.</p>
<p>EA's servers are controlled by EA not Microsoft. You should contact EA support.</p>

<p>As stated above, MS doesn't control the EA servers. I don't think I've played an EA title online without some problem with their servers at some point. If the problem is consistent, you will need to head over to their forums (<a href="http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/categories/list.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forum.ea.com/.../list.page</a>)
 and voice your concerns there. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> dolphrex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live not working with Paypal in Mexico</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I've tried in so many ways to purchase Microsoft Points online that I'm about to give up. Probably you can help.</p>
<p>What the issue is:</p>
<p>"Cannot authorize this form of payment."</p>
<p>What I've already done:</p>
<p>1. Eliminate Paypal account and register the Paypal account again</p>
<p>2. Try it on the console</p>
<p>3. Try it online</p>
<p>4. Make sure I have the same name and address on the Xbox Live Account and the Paypal Account</p>
<p>5. Make sure I have available funds on the Paypal account</p>
<p>6. Call Microsoft support online</p>
<p>7. Register a Debit Card (with no "Electron" legend on it). Try with it both online and in the console.</p>
<p>8. Call Paypal</p>
<p>9. Call your bank (the Debit Card one)</p>
<p>NOTHING WORKS. Everyone says its someone else's fault. I just bought my anti virus with the same Paypal Account with no problems. I'm starting to think this is something personal between Paypal Mexico and Microsoft. I would go to a 7-eleven and buy a card,
 but it is 15% more expensive than doing it online (or you get 15% less points, however you want to look at it). But I do not have a credit card. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hey there Dolphrex! Do you happen to know the age that is listed on your account? As Paypal is only available to users 18 years of age or older. Just would like to confirm as I don't see you check this above!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this error message can pop up when you've had too many unsuccessful attempts, have you had the chance to wait 24-48 hours in between purchase attempts? As one of the steps you've tried could have done the trick but it might not be going through because
 of multiple attempts. Let us know!</p>

    <title>Audio Device Graph Isolation eats up memory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio Device Graph Isolation eats up memory</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Audio Device Graph Isolation (audiodg.exe) eats up memory.</p>
<p>There are many questions on that in Microsoft Community, but usually people report that adviced solutions do not help. There is also a solution with Hotfix (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981013)</a>, but
 this solution is not for my Operating system (I have Windows 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem:</p>
<p>When I listen music 1) without headphones or loudspeakers OR 2)with loudspeakers OR 3)with headphones without microphone</p>
<p>- no problem ocures, Audio Device Graph Isolation does not appear in the Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>If I plug in headphones with microphone, Audio Device Graph Isolation launches and eats up memory very fast, even if I just type in Word, the letters appear on the screan with a delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I listen music in Internet, using Internet Explorer. If I kill the process Audio Device Graph Isolation, the sound disappears. I must restart IE again to hear anything. But after a few minutes Audio Device Graph Isolation&nbsp; launches again.</p>
<p>What I find really strange it that the problem occurs only with headphones that have microphone integrated. And No problem with laudspeakers or other headphones without&nbsp; microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Could you recommends some solutions that worked for other people? Usually people in Microsoft Community repport that the solutions suggested do not help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong> is an audio file for recent versions of&nbsp; Windows that prevents other applications from modifying audio-related content&nbsp; and plug-ins. The application also serves as the audio engine for Windows. The&nbsp;
 process typically launches when you start your computer and is nothing to worry&nbsp; about if you see it pop up in the Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong> runs under the process name "audiodg.exe"&nbsp; and is a component of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating&nbsp; systems. The file runs the audio engine for Windows, which allows third party&nbsp; code from vendor audio
 applications to run sound in the computer system. The&nbsp; process is not crucial to basic computer functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error code or error message while startup?</p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in this scenario, I would suggest you to try re-installing the latest Sound Card drivers from the computer manufacturer's website and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Follow the steps to uninstall the Network card driver:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X </strong>keys and then click
<strong>Device Manger</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Search for <strong>Sound, Video and Game controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click the <strong>Sound </strong>card that you are using and click
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Follow the prompt and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download the latest Sound card drivers from the computer manufacturer's website and install it on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>HMM I have the same issue with it eating up memory </p>
<p>I'm running windows 8.1 PRO X64 </p>
<p>I have sound blaster X-FI Titanium Fatal1ty sound driver with the latest W8.1 sound driver straight from Creative website</p>
<p>Right now the audio graph isolation is using 2455.9 MB all by it's self.</p>
<p>I am also using headphones with no MIC </p>
<p>I never had this issue with earlier versions of windows</p>
<p>although it eats memory up everything still runs smoothly I just rather have the extra ram for other programs..

            <p>I was surprised by your recommendation to download the computer manufacturer's sound card driver, since I've read in so many places within the Microsoft community to NOT do this, at least in most cases, rather to rely upon Windows Update. I have a new HP
 Envy that is regularly offering me new drivers from HP and I've been repeatedly advised, even at times by HP! to resist, to only follow Windows Update.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since this computer comes with Beats audio HP installs their audio driver, which has no enhancements. --I mention this because I've seen a couple of post (in this thread too) that recommend turning off enhancements to solve the problem.--&nbsp; Given I was having
 problems with the driver when I first got the computer I dumped it and installed a basic Windows 8 audio driver (I forget how I got it) and was unable to figure out how to get the "big" sound back that used to be possible through tweaks in Enhancements, and
 is automatically there with the Beats driver. HP recommended I try a different Beats driver from a few on their download site, and it has been working fine.&nbsp; However...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the past couple of weeks I am seeing, for the first time ever, the Audio Graph Device Isolation (what a name!) process. I normally restart my computer once every 5 or 6 days, when I see RAM usage climbing. (note: with Windows 7 on a Samsung laptop the
 sleep-wake cycle usually "reset" ram almost like a restart!) However now by day 3 Audio Graph Device Isolation is climbing, a steady daily climb, to become second in RAM use, next to Firefox, the kind of RAM drain.&nbsp; Unfortunately I cannot figure out how to
 restart the process, though I've read a couple of posts that claim they end the process and somehow get their sound back without rebooting.
<strong>If you know how to do this, please tell me!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to say I have not made any changes to my computer since this problem began, but then I recall doing an update from HP's support assistant, where I only update components that I believe are not are not competing with Microsoft. I checked Programs
 and Features and sure-as-shootin not only did I find a recent update, but it is an HP program that provides internet music, called HP Connected Music. While I'm not using it lately, maybe this somehow interacts with the sound card/driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike others who report here, I am not using a headset, rather the process will begin sucking RAM only after I open a program that uses audio: Skype, Facebook, YouTube. Recently when I used videochat on Facebook the process ramped up to 300Mb and didn't
 go back down after closing Facebook.&nbsp; Final note: (and sorry for the horrendously long post!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workarounds: somehow we consider workarounds as solutions! I've always relied upon Enhancements to get acceptable sound from a laptop, since I discovered them, by pure luck (so many people, even tech savvies, simply don't know about those settings). Windows
 put them there and they've always served us well. So it doesn't seem in any way like a "fix" to disable a fundamental component to getting good sound from a laptop!&nbsp; In any case, I'm guessing that the Beats driver has a non-adjustable component which is like
 Enhancements enabled, and something, whether the update to the HP Music program or something else, has brought out this glitch. I'm pretty bummed at what seems to be a legitimate system problem with no real fix!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts that don't require surgery?&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formidably named&nbsp;<strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;device made it impossible to use&nbsp;the&nbsp;Speech&nbsp;Recognition&nbsp;because it devoured CPU. &nbsp;After much turmoil, I
 did a simple thing which worked for me. &nbsp;I open <strong>Sound</strong>, opened the Recording tab, and opened up&nbsp;Proprieties&nbsp;for&nbsp;my microphone. &nbsp;It works with Playback as well. &nbsp;That took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;Microphone&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Properties
 where I opened the Advanced Tab. &nbsp;I unchecked the Exclusive Modes, and clicked on Apply. &nbsp;That's it. &nbsp;I have it run in a far more&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;way since then: 10 to 11%.</span></p>
<p>I am using 8.1 on an HP Stream Tablet 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I really hope it&nbsp;works&nbsp;for you</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the heads up Laurence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, this thread is actually about "memory" consumption, not CPU... yet it seems that in post throughout the internet these are being talked about interchangeably.&nbsp; In my case the problem is ONLY memory related, CPU not a problem, and the
 only fix recommended is for a driver (default Windows) which I don't have, as I have Beats audio installed, and there driver does not include the variables that people are disabling in the speaker tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, kudos to your cleverness is discovering the work-around, as a lot of people also report the CPU problem.

            I had a terrible time with audio device graph isolation - Dell support couldn't help, Microsoft suggested I pay them $100 to diagnose my system remotely - Dell ended up sending me a brand new hard disk to reinstall which I did only to find that when I
 ran audio the cpu escalated up to 100% again. &nbsp;Surprisingly, very odd -- after I got a bluetooth adapter &amp; ran audio via bluetooth the audio device graph isolation process operated at normal cpu - however it does "flare up" from time to time when I check cpu
 it goes to 100% from time to time but then fades away again -- and even more odd than anything I installed Virtual Box and installed Linux in Virtual Box &amp; everytime I ran Linux through Virtual Box the cpu climbed up to 100%. &nbsp;This was very discouraging when,
 one afternoon by chance I found that when I was operating Linux through Virtual Box that, even though audio device graph isolation showed that it wasn't using any cpu that when I right clicked it and ended the process th

<p>
I have a Logitech K360 keyboard and M510 mouse using the unified receiver, running Windows 8 Pro. When my computer goes to sleep I am unable to wake it up using the keyboard or mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have checked to ensure:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
1. Wake up from sleep using USB devices is enabled in my PC's BIOS Settings.</p>
<p>
2. "Allow this device to wake the computer" is checked for the Keyboard, Mouse and USB Ports in Windows Device Manager.</p>
<p>
3. Have run Windows Update and verified that I have the latest drivers for the mouse, keyboard as well as the latest BIOS firmware version.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Still it does not work.&nbsp;<span>However, I am able to wake up the PC by pressing the using the PC's power button. This option is proves difficult base on how my PC is physically setup
 and would prefer using the keyboard.</span></p>

<p>Press the <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> keys to <strong>Select All</strong> and press the
<strong>Delete</strong> Key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to delete a contiguous &nbsp;<strong>Group</strong> of emails, select the
<strong>first email</strong> in the group.</p>
<p>Hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> Key and click the <strong>last</strong> email in the group.</p>
<p>This will select all of the emails between the first and last emails you selected.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>Delete</strong> Key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also select <strong>Multi[ple</strong> Emails that are not contiguous.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>first</strong> email, press and hold the <strong>Ctrl </strong>
Key and select the other individual emails.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>Delete</strong> Key.</p>

            I am also getting this issue. And I have been noticing after anniversary update getting random freezing where I can't check settings or task manager only way to fix it for a while is to restart the computer back to normal. I hoped this update would fix
 it; but it gets stuck at 45% all the time

            <p>Not only does it hold your computer hostage why you get this unwanted anniversary update, holding your computer RAM to ransom and stopping&nbsp; you use your computer. But you cannot say<strong> I DO NOT WANT THIS UPDATE AND HOW DO I STOP THIS DOWNLOAD?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT I WANT CHOICE ON WHEN AND WHERE I CHOOSE TO DOWNLOAD, YOU HAD THIS IN WINDOWS 8.1 BUT THIS CHOICE IS DENIED FOR WINDOWS 10 VERSION, 1511 USERS. COMPOUNDED BY VERSION 1607 ONCE IT DOES COMPULSORILY UPGRADE WHERE EVEN LESS CHOICE IS OFFERED. AS A
 MICROSOFT CUSTOMER I WANT CHOICE, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR AS YOU DID HAVE THIS FACILITY IN VERSION 8.1 BUT ARE NOW TREATING VERSION 10 CUSTOMERS POORLY BY NOT OFFERING CHOICE. NOT EVERYONE USERS THEIR COMPUTER FOR FACEBOOK ONLY AND NOT CARE ABOUT WHEN

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that you have posted your question on technet aswell, that is the correct forum for your type of question as MS Answers is mostly for "consumer" support.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is the information i have been able to locate for you : <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you have purchase Windows Svr 2012 OEM you can downgrade your OS to 2008 R2 or 2008.</p>
<p>To downgrade you need to acquire Windows Svr 2008 Media and Product Key. Use the Same Media install it and reach the local MS Activation Center stating that you are trying to downgrade Windows Svr 2012 to 2008.</p>
<p>Further a Representative wil help you to downgrade it.</p>

<h2>            I reset my Windows 10 and Clicked Removed Everything accidentally</h2>
                    <p>All I originally wanted to do was to roll back my free upgrade of windows 10 back to windows 7.</p>
<p>I thought resetting would do the job and I reset and also accidentally clicked remove everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all my previous data is gone and I have no idea how to recover everything or go back to windows 7.</p>
<p>I have important work emails on my outlook, and other important&nbsp;files that all got erased.</p>
<p>I'm not the most computer literate so I also didn't back up anything before the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to read on some forums and postings online and people have been saying that the data is in the Windows.old file, however, in my case, everything is pretty much empty in that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please direct me as to how I might be able to get everything back?</p>

            <p>Your scenario does not look good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct way to revert to Windows 7 is:</p>
<p><span>Start &gt; Settings &gt;&nbsp;Update &amp; Security, in the left pane &gt; Recovery &gt; Go back to Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the button <em>
Get started</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You could try that, but it may not work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Otherwise you may have to reinstall your original Windows 7 system - reset to factory or use install media.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using computers, one of the first things you should learn to do is how to back up your data on to external media or the cloud, so situations like this are not so devastating.&nbsp; A system

    <title>Windows 10 restarts my computer every time it shuts down, but the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacketjames  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 restarts my computer every time it shuts down, but the problem isn&#39;t fast startup</h2>
                    <p>The other day I decided to finally upgrade my desktop from windows 7 to windows 10. It was great until I tried to shut it down for the night, and discovered that my computer would immediately boot itself back up anywhere from two seconds to a minute after
 shutdown. A quick Google search suggests that the problem is a power setting called fast startup, but my computer doesn't even have a checkbox for that option, it doesn't exist for me. After messing around in regedit and a few other places, I spent an hour
 or so with a microsoft support tech who tried various things and eventually told me to roll back to windows 7 and re-upgrade to 10, this time using the microsoft upgrade tool from the website instead of that corner popup.</p>
<p>I reverted to 7 and went to bed since it was pretty late, and today I re-upgraded to windows 10 and then tried shutting the computer down. It worked fine, and just to be sure I tried it again a little later in the day, and it worked again. I thought everything
 was fine, but just now I tried to power down for the night, which this time included installing updates. It immediately booted back up, I shut down again and it installed more updates and restarted. I tried a third time, with no updates, and just when I thought
 it was okay it restarted again. So now the best I can guess is that the issue is related to one of the installed updates, which I can't seem to make windows show me a list of. If anyone can help me out with this I'd appreciate it, bearing in mind that as I
 said earlier it isn't fast startup since my computer can't even do that. Thanks!</p>

            Hi Bonnie,
<div><br />
<div>It sounds like they factory reloaded your machine and forgot to put a sound driver back on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To check, Click start&gt;right click computer&gt;click manage.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the computer management windows comes up, look on the left side and find the entry for "Device Manager."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click on this and devices will display in the middle portion of the window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you see anything at all that has a yellow "!" or a red "x" on it, then you know that they forgot drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is the case, you can at this point go to websites and get drivers, or take it back to Best Buy and make them do it for you for free.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            update automation &#40;1803 -&#62; 1903&#41;</h2>
                    hi! at work there was a need to automate the update Windows 10 1803 to 1903. automation should be maximized by pressing a single button. decided to write powershell script. use the pswindowsupdate module. this works like a charm. BUT! only 2 updates are
 available. how do I get cumulative updates? is there another way to remotely update? (Pro wsus know). Why only 2 updates?

            Asking it at Technet would be better as it requires IT Professionals support which is handled there better.

<p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Skype is installed on your device? Is it&nbsp;the pre-installed Skype with your Windows 10 laptop?&nbsp;Also, is there any error that shows up when you try to launch Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

            got the new laptop yesterday and yes it is the version preinstalled. All the Skype preview did was spin and then I would get an OOPs message that told me to try later. I tried several fixes and finally got it to work. Not sure which fix worked but something
 I did worked. Thanks for your response!

<h2>            Re-Setting Password</h2>
                    I do not know what my Skype password is, as I have not use it in awhile.&nbsp; The Yahoo! address I had signed up via Skype with is no longer valid. I was able to get a recovery number via my Hotmail account.&nbsp; Using that, I have tried four times to re-set my
 password, and I keep getting an automated reply from Skype/Hotmail saying that I did not provide enough sufficient information.&nbsp; For Christ's sake, all I want to do is re-set my damned Skype Password, not break into Ft. Knox.&nbsp; You guys want every last friggin'
 e-mail address to whom I sent e-mails to, subject lines and everything else under the sun, which I provided, and that is still not enough information!&nbsp; All I want to do is reset my damned password!

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly advise you to fill up the form again&nbsp;as it is the primary way to recover your Skype account. You may use this tips that

</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</span></li><li>
<span>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</span></li><li>
<span>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</span></li><li>
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that
 you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</span>&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul>
<p>As another alternative, you can also use our reinstatement form for you to request access to your account which you can do so&nbsp;in this link:

    <title>explorer.exe is not a valid win32 application, can&#39;t run sfc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hassanyousuf  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer.exe is not a valid win32 application, can&#39;t run sfc &#47;scannow now either.</h2>
                    The other day I was scanning my PC and removing my threats, after I removed then and I rebooted. The next day and I was copying my files to my USB and shut downed my PC.<br />
<br />
The next day when I rebooted it, the whole PC went black, I can't see anything, task bar, explorer, my computers, icons etc. And when I open Task Manager and type explorer.exe it says "<span style="font-weight: bold">explorer.exe is not a valid win32 application</span>".
 Can anyone help me with this? I went to repair my PC using Windows 7 DVD but the results were the same. I googled it about the help but no similar results found. Does anyone know how to fix it? I think my explorer.exe is corrupted, how do I get a fresh new
 explorer.exe?<br />
<br />
I tried to go to CMD and&nbsp; type sfc /scannow but it said "Windows resource protection could not start repair service."<br />
I went to Microsoft Answers to search it but turns out in Administrative tools it was already set to Manual.<br />
<br />
I tried to system restore but it said no restore points found.<br />
<br />
The only thing I use to open firefox, games etc is Task Manager &gt; CMD. I can't open any folders or file, I have to go to the directory in CMD and run it.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
