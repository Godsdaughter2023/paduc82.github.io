<h2>            How to fix my System Restore</h2>
                    I have run into a serious problem with System Restore. Over time, I've created a new Restore Point once a month as a precaution. But last night, when I really needed to use System Restore, it showed NO Restore points. I tried creating new ones and found
 that I could. But soon thereafter each of them was gone. I'd be grateful for any help with this.&nbsp;

            Norton does not like System Restore. You cannot rely on System Restore with Norton on the computer. For a home user there are a number of suitable freeware anti-virus products that do not interfere with system restore, and generally cause far less problems
 than Norton.

            <p>Win7 creates a restore point automatically when windows update runs and installs important updates. They are also created when installing MS software.</p>
<p>Restore points are unlikely to be retained from xx months ago, the system will only keep restore points depending the amount of disk space allowed for restore.</p>
<p>Computor&gt;Properties&gt;System Protection, will show which drives are protected &amp; from the Configure Btn the space available for the restore points.</p>
<p>I would'nt recommend useing any driver update utility</p>

 for running the power troubleshooter did not work.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            The tread seems to describe a laptop.&nbsp; In this case it is my desktop.&nbsp; When I move the mouse I hear the computer activate but the screen remains off until I restart the system, very irritating.&nbsp; I don't know what changed but this happened over the course
 of about 10 days while the system was on but not accessed.

<p>Thank you for your response. If the above solution did not work, let's try another workaround. Try resetting all the power profiles you have back to their default settings, boot your PC then change the power profile you used before to a customized value.
 Then see if your device will work properly after the provided steps.</p>

<h2>            latest windows 10 update completely wrecked my computer&#33;</h2>
                    <p>just used the automatic windows update facility, here is what happened after such a well tested update!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>problem number one:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>my pst file was no longer being used by outlook</li><li>relinked my pst file file only to find 5 years of emails stored in approc 30 sub-folders were missing</li><li>used scanpst, whilst scanning it displays number of emails and sub folders...GREAT!!!</li><li>opened outlook no change still no historic emails and no subfolders.</li><li>attempt various different option via google search, to no avail still not working.</li></ol>
<p><strong>problem number two:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>my audio is only running through my monitor!! </li><li>update drivers..nothing</li><li>uninstall all drivers ....reboot...nothing</li><li>cannot even see the speakers i have attached to the sound card!! only the friggin monitor</li><li>try endless things via google search to reslove...nothing it only shows the monitor as if nothing else exists
</li><li>yes i have the show disabled and discconected showing</li><li>absolutely nothing showing in recording devices at all</li></ol>

<p>Hi Sheldy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that software conflicts or outdated drivers may have caused this issue on your computer. Since this happened after installing the latest Windows 10 update, we suggest starting your computer using minimal drivers and startup programs
 to help us find out what causes this issue and how to address it. Please check out
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a> for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the issue persists after performing a clean boot, then we may have to proceed with a repair install using Media Creation Tool. Please create first your own installation media using either a USB flash drive or a DVD. Please refer to the following
 links:</p>

<h2>            How do I hide or rename the &#34;&#92;&#92;&#63;&#92;Volume&#34; drive&#63;</h2>
                    For some reason I now have another drive in my Defrag menu. I've looked around the internet and have been told you can't remove this mystery drive as it's a critical thing for Windows operation. So the question remains, how do I hide it from the Defrag
 menu? Or at least rename it as some people say it's suppose to be named "System Reserve" and I only have 3 drives named "System", "Recovery" and the C drive in the Defrag menu.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef18775-1a41-497d-90df-bde2dee11f96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef18775-1a41-497d-90df-bde2dee11f96" /></a>

<h3> evilmark443  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0xc004c003 ... I built this myself, with an OEM copy of Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, I'm getting Error Code 0xC004C003 after upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;I built this computer about a year and a half ago, and installed an OEM copy of Windows 7 I had purchased from Newegg.com some time before but never used. &nbsp;I know for an
 absolute fact my Windows 7 install was legit with a valid Key, so why am I receiving this error? &nbsp;Is there anything I can do? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thread linked below seems to suggest waiting a few days will get it working, but that information is directed towards an Insider, which I am not, so I'm unsure how relevant it is. &nbsp;I completely understand the possibility of the activation servers being
 overloaded, but I can't help but feel highly alarmed by this, especially when Microsoft's help page for error codes essentially says anyone with this error is using a pirated key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is I have 30 days to downgrade back to my original Windows 7 installation, would I be better off doing that and upgrading to Windows 10 in a month or two after the initial wave of activations starts to die down? &nbsp;I thank you for any and
 all help you may provide. &nbsp;Oh and, if it matters, I did not wait for Windows Update to tell me my reservation was ready, I instead downloaded the media creation tool and used that to upgrade.</p>

            you can try what worked for me (my error code was blank but it might work). run msconfig disable all 3rd party software services and make sure windows update and your network services are running and click okay select yes to restart and then open update
 and security and try to activate afterwards rerun msconfig and enable al services again. hope it works for you cause i spent 5 hours on the phone with rep for him to figure this solution out and tell me it was a windows glitch. &nbsp;

            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The following error is received on the Activation page after a clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows cannot be fully configured until it is activated, however it will not accept the Windows 7 or 8.x product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 0xC004C003 - The activation server determined the specified product key has been blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Cause:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Due to performing a “clean” install using a Windows 10 CD or USB. The first time Windows 10 is installed on a Windows 7 or Windows 8.x PC, it must be “upgraded” not the “clean” install option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Install your previous version of Windows. (7 or 8.x)</li><li>Install all Windows updates.</li><li>Run the Windows 10 CD or USB within Windows (not during bootup)</li><li>Follow the on-screen instruction to UPGRADE to Windows 10. &nbsp;The UPGRADE process converts your old Windows key into a new Windows 10 key. &nbsp;It will not ask for the key, and after installation Windows 10 will be activated. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; Ensure you do not pick any advanced options to perform a complete wipe of your drive to perform a clean install when installing Windows 10 for the first time.</p>

            I am unable to connect the computer I am trying to upgrade to the internet but it did have a copy of Win 7 Home Premium installed on it when it was purchased from Dell. This means I used another PC to download and create installation media on a USB drive
 that I then used to do a clean install. Is there a way for me to activate correctly this copy of windows I now have installed?

            <p>You have to connect to the internet to activate Windows, unless there is a way to do it by phone, but I doubt that will work now.&nbsp; Does it have a wireless adapter so you can briefly connect online through a cellphone or anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you do have to <em>upgrade with the ISO, by running setup.exe from&nbsp;your ISO, from&nbsp;within an activated Windows 7 or 8 before you can activate a clean install of Windows 10 on that device.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still have a way to install Windows 7 Home Premium using your Product Key?&nbsp; You then will need Windows 10 Home of the same type (32-bit or 64-bit) as your Windows 7, in order to be able to launch setup.exe.</p>

            It does have internet connectivity now, it was just so riddled with spam and whatnot before it could do anything once it booted up. I think I will have to find a windows 7 iso to go back to 7, activate it using the product key that came with the laptop
 version of windows 7 and then do the in windows upgrade to windows 10.&nbsp;

    <title>srttrail.txt problem and stuck on black screen with circling dots - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucaaaa x  say:</h3>
<h2>            srttrail.txt problem and stuck on black screen with circling dots every week, have to WIPE every week or 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello, a couple months ago i got an error when logging in about srt trail, with the automatic repair not being able to fix the problem. I tried many many ways to fix it, and the only way i was able to log back in was using a removable device to reset the
 windows. This was the start. Since then, I have been constantly getting that error or recently the black screen with circling dots on bootup being stuck forever, and it is frustrating having to wipe literally every week. In addition to this, as time went past
 my pc literally started deteriorating software wise; random programs would just stop working and never would, windows update just wouldnt update, and i started getting lots of other little problems all over that i couldnt fix no matter the methods i tried,
 and it came to the point where literally a few things would work which was chrome, discord and a few games. I also contacted microsoft inbetween all of this and their fix didnt really help, just stopped the srttrail error popping up for a few weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this, I assumed it was my hard drive with the problem as it is a few years old this pc, so i bought a new one and tried it. In a few days or a week i got the srt trail error once again, and had to reset which is very frustrating as I have like 50gb
 and hours of effort i have to go through with some mods for games, and files etc etc that i have to set up EVERY time, which isnt nice. I made sure i installd windows on the new drive and made sure the old one wasnt connected in any way so it was just the
 new drive, and still problems. I have had to partition it or reset it a few times and have the windows.old folder on it so i can get my old files and mods back, which doing this way messes them up a bit but is quicker than doing them all again i guess</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, back on topic, I should not have to do this reset at most every 2 weeks and start over. Its stupid. I know im no expert but my guess is something wrong with windows update messing up on the same update over and over to cause this happening, or maybe
 some integrated hardware or software is broken somewhere else in the PC. I really dont care whether I have to replace a part I am that fed up with the error (jobless so not quite enough to buy a new pc, but then again i shouldnt have to do this and if i did
 then why do i have to pay) or do something. Just please help me get rid of this permanently im sick to death of it. Thank you for taking time to read my rant/question, I apologize for the bad English shown anywhere, I am currently too frustrated to add every

<div>Hi Lucaaaa x,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a number of factors as to why you are getting the Srttrail.txt error upon the startup of your computer. This could be caused by a corrupted startup file or due to a software conflict. Kindly verify if you have installed any third-party antivirus

</li><li>Once the computer boots up for the third time, you will see the loading dots on the screen and the message "<strong>Preparing automatic repair</strong>".<br />
</li><li>Afterwards, your PC may turn blank then it will show "<strong>Diagnosing your PC</strong>".<br />
</li><li>It will ask you to restart or choose Advanced options, choose <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.
<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong></em></li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run chkdsk.</strong></p>

</li><li>Copy or type these commands and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk /r c:</strong></em></li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Disable Early launch anti-malware protection.</strong></p>
<ol>

<h2>            ugee 2150 pen display not recognized as a tablet windows 10 version 1709 &#40;OS build 16299.64&#41; AMD FirePro 4300 video card.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any help you can give me.</p>
<p>Received a UG 2150 pen display today. Windows sees and installs and uses generic video driver.&nbsp; So it works as a display.&nbsp; Mouse works on this monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I try to install the UGEE 2150 updated driver from their website or the one that came with the product I receive the following error and won't install the software.</p>
<p>No tablet was detected</p>
<p>please connect your tablet to the computer before driver installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The firepro 4300 video card had mini display ports and I am using an active hdmi adapter to plug into the monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where does windows 10 show a tablet.</p>
<p>Under device manager under human interface devices I only have two usb devices.&nbsp; One for the mouse and one for the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi Randall.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can toggle on Tablet Mode in Settings&gt;System&gt;Tablet Mode. 
<br />
<br />Then Check for Updates at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            This might be a compatibility issue, so consider rolling back if you recently upgraded.
<br />
<br />Download the driver:
<br />
<br />    Find the driver you need on <a href="http://www.ugee.eu/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ugee.eu/support</a>
<br />    Download the driver into your hard disk
<br />    Unzip the downloaded folder into your hard disk
<br />    Open the unzipped folder
<br />    Find the setup.exe icon and run it as administrator
<br />    Follow the on screen instructions
<br />
<br />Note: Be sure to close down any programme(s) you don’t need running on your computer to prevent any third party software from corrupting the installation
<br />
<br />Install the driver: 
<br />
<br />    Close down any programme you don’t need running on your computer
<br />    Disable your anti virus programme such as Fire Wall
<br />    Uninstall your existing Ugee driver (through control panel for Windows)
<br />    Check that you have uninstalled other graphics tablet drivers and it’s hidden files and all unused devices are removed – if you have not done so already:Click Here
<br />    Disconnect your tablet from your computer
<br />    Restart computer
<br />    Close down any programme you don’t need running on your computer
<br />    Check that the anti-virus program is still disabled
<br />    Install your driver again as Administrator
<br />    Restart computer
<br />    Connect your tablet to your computer after installation
<br />    Go to the driver/tablet setting and go to the “Pressure Sensitivity” tab and draw on the test area to see if you have pressure sensitivity, if it works, then the driver is installed successfully.
<br />    Enable your anti-virus programme
<br />
<br />Configure or troubleshoot tablet features:
<br />
<br />If you experience pointer lag or when  the system reboots, the tablet icon disappears, please follow the steps provided.
<br />
<br />STEP 1
<br />
<br />Press“Ctrl+ Alt and Delete” on the keyboard simultaneously and then click on the Task Manager option to open up Windows Task Manager.
<br />
<br />In the Task Manager, in the processes tab, look for “Wintab Service (32bit)” and “Tablet Client Driver (32bit)”.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don’t have “Tablet Client Driver (32bit)” in your Task Manager processes, please follow Step 2.
<br />
<br />If you don’t have “Wintab Service (32bit)” in your Task Manager processes, please follow Step 3.
<br />
<br />If you can see both processes n Task Manager please follow Step 4. 
<br />
<br />STEP 2
<br />
<br />Open the “File Explorer” on your computer and click on your C:/ drive or your main Windows 10 partition.
<br />
<br />Search “wtclient” in the search bar in the top right hand corner and press enter. Two files should appear.
<br />
<br />
<br />Select both programs shown, and double click them . A pop-up message: “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC” should appear. Click the “Yes” button and re-open Task Manager.
<br />
<br />Tablet Client Driver (32bit) should now be running and shown in  the Task Manager processes tab.
<br />
<br />STEP 3
<br />
<br />Open up the Services program by going to“Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt; Administrative Tools” and click and run “Services”.
<br />
<br />Look for “WinTab Service” , then right click the file then click Start.
<br />
<br />WinTab Service (32bit) should now be running and shown in  the Task Manager processes tab.
<br />
<br />STEP 4
<br />
<br />Reboot your computer and if an pop-up box “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?” appears click “Yes”.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>The fix to the problem I first described, I fixed right before receiving your email.&nbsp; The solution was embarrassing simple.&nbsp; Read the manual (written well) more carefully.&nbsp; So that initial problem was fixed by plugging in the correct cabling.&nbsp; &nbsp;However,
 a problem arose after that problem that I can't fix by careful study of the well written manual.&nbsp; This seems to be in regard to the the version 1709 update.&nbsp; From others remarks found on the internet, it seems that this update caused my ability to calibrate
 and set the pen to not work in the given software.&nbsp; I have sent an email to UGEE about this problem. I think they are aware of it and are hopefully about to launch an update.&nbsp; (i'd bet they are due to Christmas and these being given as gifts)&nbsp; I may have to
 roll back the windows update but I'd rather not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how the calibration is grayed out?&nbsp; This and the pressure doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks so very much for helping me.&nbsp; I hope you have a wonderful evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Thanks for reporting back Randall.  
<br />
<br />There are a lot of problems with Fall Creators Version 1709.   If you need to you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and wait awhile for it to mature and to get an answer from your tablet maker.  
<br />
<br />To assure it doesn't force install just hide it afterwards using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here and run to Check for Update and then hide them:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p>Dear Mr. Costa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in the above reply, I goofed up and did not read the manual well.&nbsp; After plugging in all the cables it started to work well.&nbsp; My problem also was that I had two monitors of higher resolution and they needed to be turned down.&nbsp; Next I need
 to turn one extra monitor off when running the tablet. So running a slightly reduced resolution on my monitors and turning one off while I work with the tablet just about got everything running.&nbsp; I found both of these on the internet and they helped.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I did use some of your advice and it really helped.&nbsp; I need to re- try your advice again, I got most of the software to work and the pen now seems to work.&nbsp; Just needs to be calibrated and have the sensitivity set.&nbsp; This is my new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another place on the internet says that the windows version 1709 causes some of the needed UGEE setup software not to work correctly. This update may be effecting the calibration and sensitivity to now not be able to use the UGEE software to correctly set.&nbsp;
 So as a result, the author of that post recommended contacting UGEE, and that is what I did.&nbsp; I am waiting on their response.&nbsp; It was also recommended as one resort that I could roll back the version 1709.&nbsp; But I think I will wait to see what UGEE says.&nbsp; But
 as a fine expert you may have a better plan and I sure appreciate you help.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I find any solution I will post it as soon as I can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a million for your help..&nbsp; Have a wonderful day.</p>

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>I will let you know what UGEE says.&nbsp; I will roll back the update using your method if they don't have a great solution. They usually answer in the evening (China regular work time) so I should have something from them tomorrow morning Texas time.&nbsp; They have
 been very good in answering questions.&nbsp; They pointed out my goofup.&nbsp; But did it kindly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help with the force install.&nbsp; I would have really missed that aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another vote for rooftop rumble here. Call in a helo from Merryweather while you kill the people in the garage, by the time it lands all you have to do it grab the documents and fly a couple of miles away. Plus you get double the amount of RP than Coveted.
</p>
<p>I wouldn't really listen to that clown...he didn't even know how to get rid of a vehicle in his garage to replace it with a different one. smh...</p>

<p>I'm ranking up at the same speed in my 90's as I was in the 80's. Early on you might require less XP as the jobs available then give less XP. It feels like after a certain level it's just one set number every level.</p>

            <p>Hi Avis,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>I understand that you wish to have the Calendar to open automatically when you boot the computer. Have you installed any third party Calendar program on your computer?</p>
<p>The calendar program is not available in Windows 7 you can make use of the calendar that comes with Windows Live. Refer the link for more information on this.</p>
<p><b>Looking for Windows Calendar?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/looking-for-windows-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/looking-for-windows-calendar</a></p>
<p>If you have installed a third party program then that program can be made to open when you boot the computer by adding the Calendar program executable file to Startup
 folder. Follow the steps to do this.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Create a short cut on the Desktop for the Calendar program .exe file.</p>
<p>Right click on the Desktop.</p>
<p>Choose “Create Shortcut”</p>
<p>Browse to the folder that contains the .exe for the Calendar program.</p>
<p>Click Ok.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Open Computer.</p>
<p>Navigate to the path C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</p>
<p>(Where C is the drive on which Windows was installed)</p>
<p>Drag and drop the shortcut you had created in Step 1.</p>
<p>Check if this helped you accomplish what you wanted and let us know.</p>

<p>So let me clarify, you have your xX GT on the console, and when you look under Account Management for the WLID, that is the one you are trying to log in here with, but you are showing as wallenoak here instead? Have you recently changed your WLID or GT on
 either of these accounts? </p>

 account for you. Sorry for the hassle, but let me know how it goes. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Velveeta Instant Win No Prize Received</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I recently won an instant win contest on the dashboard. It was the "Kraft Velveeta Instant Win Giveaway" and appeared as an ad on the corner of one of the pages... To win, all I had to do was click on a video to watch and it said "congratulations!"
 Etc etc and asked for my email, which I put in, and I am 100% sure I put it in correctly and used the same email as my Microsoft account. Well, that was 2 weeks ago, and since then I have received no prize (1200 Microsoft points). I've read the rules before
 and plenty of times after I won and nowhere does it depict a delay in prize delivery (hence, instant win+email) but obviously there is. When I search this issue online, or the contest at all, the only thing I get is the post I made on the Xbox forums asking
 about it. I'm simply concerned with 1. The validity of the contest and if I am missing a clause in the rules that says I must wait for the prize and 2. If I'll receive the prize at all. I'm really quite patient usually, I'd just like to take advantage of a
 sale that ends Monday and it would make it all the more sweeter if it was for free and on sale. Thank you for any help you can give.<br />
<br />
This is the message I sent to support chat earlier^<br />
I was told that there was nothing they could do for me except direct me here. My agent couldn't even verify that the promotion was real. I understand that I should wait a month or two before usually asking for support but this is an instant win contest that
 I didn't even receive a verification email for. Apparently, there is no way to prove that I even won. At this point I'm just worried that I'm getting stiffed out of the points.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance with this. Like I said, I was hoping to get it sorted before the spring sale ended, but now I'm just worried about getting them at all.</p>
<p>( I won on Saturday March 26 at about 11:30 am EST. the promotion is simply a page with 6 or 8 videos about various situations with people eating Mac and Cheese. The "you won" page showed up before the video played. Official rules said March-May promo with
 333 prizes and the time of day determines winner, typical instant win stuff. I entered my email after I won exactly as it is and appears on my account. In the rules, there is an email for a secondary giveaway, it is;

<p>Hey there Yankee! Congratulations on your win! I'm not personally familiar with this promotion. Could you send us a link to the promotions and/or the rules for it? I know most times promotions take several weeks to finish up, get all the winners' info, and
 then send out the goods. Usually this takes as many as 8 weeks. Once I have a little more info on the promo, we can look into that. Thanks!

<p>I have found the promotion on the dashboard. Here are the rules and a picture of the promotion. The only thing you will deduce from these rules is that I am not receiving the points because my email was incorrect but I assure you I quadruple checked the
 email against my account's email before submitting.</p>

<p>Gwyther, thanks for the consistent help, but I've already emailed that email twice with no reply (in fact, if you check my first post, I've mentioned it). The first was to enter the "second chance" drawing for this promotion, article 6 of rules I believe,
 and the second was to ask about this problem with no reply. I'll try again, however, as I'm sure there isn't much you can do beyond trying to point me in the hopefully right direction</p>

<p>Mine came in, they sent me two so I think it was the two emails I sent that we're processed and bounced back, same code in each. My problem is solved. Woo!</p>
<p>As for you Nelson, I don't think the codes you've received will have anything to do with this promotion, as it only pays out 1200 MSP, not 400. However, if you're sure you won, shoot them an email and wait a few weeks</p>

                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering if there was a way that all conversations you have ever had on your account could be deleted. By that I mean as if the conversations never happened (All messages ever sent between you and everyone else
<strong>completely erased from</strong> <strong>your and their Skypes</strong>). If I could get an answer to this question, that would be fantastic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Resetting or updating BIOS can make your Computer inoperable if not done correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the Dell advice for reinstalling, Boot problems and the diagnostics software, which you have&nbsp;apparently used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If nothing fixes it, you will have to contact Dell or ask in the Dell Support Forums about your BIOS problems; link included below.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 OEM ISO Download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanneufeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 OEM ISO Download</h2>
                    <p>My Samsung laptop HDD died which held my recovery partition. I no longer have a recovery media as it was wiped by mistake years ago. My laptops Windows 8 license is stored in BIOs firmware so I need to reinstall Windows 8 with an OEM version of an ISO. I
 don't think a retail version of Windows 8 will work to have the license auto populate after Windows is installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Samsung support and they straight up said they do not release their recovery media at all, and also do not sell it. They said to use BestBuy but best buy says they don't keep recovery media at all. They said I would end up having to purchase a new
 Windows 8 license to get my laptop back running. I''m a 3rd year IT student, re-imaging the laptop will be easy once I have the ISO to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help / provide advise on what I should do?</p>

<h2>            my msn email and hotmail is running very slow what can I do to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>when I go into my msn and hotmail email accounts it processes extremely slow.&nbsp; For example, just clicking on to open or delete an email takes a long time or either the computer just freezes up.&nbsp; Also, sometimes typing takes long for letters to pop up.&nbsp; I
 checked with my internet provider and they have checked and everything is running fine.&nbsp; It seems to only be slow when I'm checking on my emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows vista if that's any help.&nbsp; Please let me know what I can do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

Please have a look again at my reply:<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no built-in "Lock" status application within most Windows versions.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the keyboard manufacturer, or laptop maker, to provide this style of application.&nbsp; Logitech and Microsoft keyboards do provide a "Locks" status module
 as part of their enhanced drivers.&nbsp; Logitech is in their SetPoint drivers and Microsoft provide these in the Intellitype drivers.<br />
<br />
Also, with several Bluetooth "protocol" drivers (not Microsoft's) can also provide the "Locks" status applet.&nbsp; It is usually for use with most Bluetooth keyboards but these can respond the regular keyboards.<br />

<p>A&nbsp;CapsLock indicator needs to be part of the normal Win7 OS install and here is why.&nbsp; I am using a brand new&nbsp;Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 s/n 0356100416937.&nbsp; I can send you a picture&nbsp;and/or the retail receipt if you doubt this assertion.&nbsp; There is no
 CapsLock indicator&nbsp;on the keyboard itself, no doubt to extend battery life.&nbsp; I also use an IOGEAR KVM switch to facilitate switching between multiple computers.&nbsp; The KVM-switch emulates a standard 102-key keyboard, so even though I load the latest kb-driver
 (MS Intellitype 8.2) the driver reports No Microsoft keyboard detected.&nbsp; Consequently, there is no way to determine when the CapsLock key is active.&nbsp; If you have ever tried to enter a long mixed-case password with the CapsLock key in the wrong state then you
 can imagine my frustration using this keyboard.</p>
<p>So how do I get the CapsLock indicator to display?</p>

HP TECH SUPPORT REMOTELY TOOK OVER MY 520TOUCHSMART AND I TOO HAD A CAPS LOCK INDICATOR ON MY SCREEN , NOW IT IS GONE. I HAD THEM PUT BACK MY MS OFFICE2010 THIS P.M. NOW I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE.MISSING I WILL FOR SURE CONTACT THEM FRIDAY. IF I FIND A SIMPLE
 FIX FOR MY PROBLEM I WILL POST IT .ANYBODY GOT A CLUE?&nbsp;
