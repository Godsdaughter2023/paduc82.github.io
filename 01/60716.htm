    <title>Can other computer access my personal files through the LAN - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can other computer access my personal files through the LAN network&#63;</h2>
                    Some background info: i moved into my school dorm few months ago and i will use the dorm internet through the lan cable in my room. i will also set up ad hoc internet connection for my phone. Just recently i realised in the " Computer &gt; Network " i am
 able to see a list of computers and media devices that is connected to this "dorm network" through the lan cable. i was worry that these users might be able to see my computer and access my personal files.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i went to check my "advanced&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;settings" and this were the following settings i had set : "Network discovery: On", "Files and Printers sharing: On", "Public folders sharing: On" and lastly "Password Protected sharing: On".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>since the "network discovery" is turned on, my computer can be seen on the network too. i realised both my "Files and Printers sharing" and "Public folders sharing" were also turned on and i was more worried about my computer being easily accessed by others
 in the dorm network. however as my password protected sharing is turned on too, is it still possible for other computers to access my computer and my personal files?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks for your kind attention</div>

            In the Network and Sharing Center, make your network a "Public network" rather than a "Home network" or "Work network."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This should have the effect of making the following settings in "Advanced sharing settings"<br />
<ul>
<li>Network discovery - Off</li><li>File and printer sharing - Off</li><li>Public folder sharing - Off</li></ul>
<p>If those settings didn't configure that way when you changed to "Public network," make them so.<br />

<p>If the title was deleted then there is no recovery option to try and recover that data.&nbsp; But the things to try are a full power cycle, by pressing the Xbox button on the console down for 10 seconds until it shuts down, remove the power cord, unplug any external
 drives you may have attached, and then waiting about 10 seconds.&nbsp; Then plug them back in and power it back up and see if the title is back in your My Games &amp; Apps. &nbsp;</p>

            You will have to download the entire game....never cancel an update or it will erase the entire game. I have to admit this can be annoying to say the least. I learned my lesson the hard way.

            Unfortunately whenever an update gets interrupted it will delete the entire game as well. So you will have to redownload it again I'm afraid.

    <title>Malfunctioning Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vickylee256  say:</h3>
<h2>            Malfunctioning Mouse</h2>
                    XP-Home SP3. Logitech MX5000 Mouse/Keyboard (Installed end of 2007). Never have had any problems with either until a month or so ago. The mouse will no longer hold an icon or window to drag, will not resize a window, nor will it highlight correctly on
 any program, browser (Latest IE8 and Firefox), or desktop.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled mouse driver/software and taken it back to the original software that came with the devises. I did a System Restore as far back as I was able to go. I have unplugged/replugged the bluethooth receiver. I have checked all USB drivers. Have
 ran Anti-Malware and Anti-virus scans.<br />
<br />
Around the beginning of October I installed a LG Flatron (W2061TQ) monitor other than that nothing else has changed from the normal operating of my computer. I keep all software updated.<br />
<br />
The only other mouse I own is a non-bluethooth mouse and if I were to install it I will lose my keyboard.

            If the mouse/keyboard have batteries, replace them. If that doesn't fix the issue, replace the mouse/keyboard. They don't last forever.

            Well, I'm saying it could happen. Am I saying for <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sure</span>
</em>it happened with <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">your</span> </em>
hardware? Certainly not since I can't see/test your hardware myself. But it is the most common reason for the symptoms you described. Try a different mouse. If the problems go away, replace the original mouse.

            I had a friend bring over a good old wired mouse and it worked. BOO HOO!!! Guess you were correct, my mouse is dying. Too bad I cannot find a replacement for it. Logitech no longer carries the MX 5000. Ebay and Amazon want way too much for the combo. I
 will have to go on a bluetooth mouse (w/charger, no batteries needed) and keyboard combo hunt now. Wish me luck.<br />

<br />For best Windows performance and least issues I would run only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />But if you insist then go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Defender &gt; Open Security Center &gt; Virus and Threat Protection Settings, turn off Real Time Protection.  This should allow installing the 3rd party anti-virus, but expect issues and don't be surprised when they happen.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>I ran BitDefender on Windows 10 for 8 months until the end of February, 2018, so I know it works and works well. I just didn't care for its user interface. I also didn't care for BitDefender's technical support, which consisted of hired contractors reading
 from scripts. No surprise to me that they were unable to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to remove an anti-malware product is with the developer's own removal tool. For BitDefender, the removal tool is
<a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I used it myself and it worked properly on the first try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were previously using any other third-party anti-malware application, you should run that application's own uninstaller. Leftover bits of a previous anti-malware application are enough to interfere with the installation of a successor anti-malware
 application. That may even have been the original problem in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once BitDefender is removed, you have several choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Install BitDefender again, following BitDefender's instructions, which are <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/consumer/support/answer/2266/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;and again <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/support/how-to-install-bitdefender-2018-1978.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's always a good idea to&nbsp;<em>temporarily</em> disable your existing anti-malware application whenever you install software. In your case that means temporarily stopping Windows Defender while you are installing another anti-malware application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Install another organization's anti-malware application. Search the web with this search term:</p>
<p>
</p><p>best windows 10 anti-malware 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among the results you'll find many reviews of anti-malware applications. Read the reviews from professional organizations (vs. stoners on YouTube,) take advantage of the free trials, and choose a product that appeals to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Stick with Windows 10's own Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether or not to choose Windows Defender or a third-party product is strictly a matter of opinion. There's no correct answer, and everyone has their own ideas, which is why I'm not giving you my own opinion. Read the professional reviews and make your own
 decision. Any product near the top of reviewers' lists will take good care of you. Well ... good care of your computer&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h2>            &#34;this version of the Microsoft Safety Scanner has expired and will no longer run on your computer&#34;</h2>
                    <i>Microsoft Safety Scanner</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hi, I'm having some problems with the Microsoft Safety Scanner. In the Actions Center it tells me that I have viruses on my computer, and if I open the messages they tell me to download the Microsoft Safety Scanner, and I follow the like to the main website,
 but whenever I download and try to install the program, I get the message "this version of the Microsoft Safety Scanner has expired and will no longer run on your computer". on a somewhat similar and possibly related note, I frequently get messages that something
 is out of date and needs an update, I have one now with flash player, telling me that it is out of date and I should go to the website and download a new version, and I got ones before for bluetooth and synaptics pointing device, but whenever I follow the
 links and download and try to install the programs, I get the message that I already have a newer version or the program I download is incompatible with my computer.<br />
<br />
P.S. The messages that I have viruses had been in the action center for a couple of weeks now I think, but now as I was typing this message they disappeared by themselves one by one, the only thing I did was clicking to see the message details. also happened
 with the message about the flash player, which had stayed after I had downloaded and tried to install the new program (only to be told I had a newer version), and disappeared a few minutes later.<br />

<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad and Microsoft Mouse</h2>
                    <p>The other day I posted a question and so far have not had any answers that work. Trying to work with Windows with out a pointing device is nearly impossible. I have tried everything that has be suggested but nothing works. I don't care that Synaptics touch
 pad does not work but what ever happened it also killed my mouse via USB. The mouse shows up as being installed and working properly but I have no mouse. I have tried several other mice with the same thing happening. I have tried all 4 of my USB ports, same
 thing. Help Help Help. I do not think it is a hardware issue as it seems to only effect pointing devices, can someone give me some suggestions? I also have uninstalled Synaptis and did a search in registry and deleted all but it keeps coming back every time
 I reboot or restart my laptop.</p>
<p>My laptop is an HP Pavilion dv7 and was working perfectly until I saw that I had an Action Notice to restart for cridical update for my Synaptics touch pad. I did and now I and BROKEN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Again, HELP HELP HELP! </p>

<p>Yes, you're right, Everett.&nbsp; It's a driver issue.&nbsp; Every device needs a driver to work with your PC and these drivers are from the device manufacturer itself.&nbsp; Windows can also download device software and info which include an app that the device manufacturer
 created to go with your device or info like the product name, manufacturer, and model number, to help you distinguish between similar devices.&nbsp; Windows can also update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's best to let Windows install device drivers automatically. But if Windows can't find a driver for your device, you can look for a driver on your device manufacturer's website. Driver updates are often available in the support section of such website.&nbsp;
 If the issue still persists, you might want to consider contacting your device manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>

    <title>Dell Inspiron keyboard adding extra characters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katkims88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Inspiron keyboard adding extra characters</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to log in to my laptop due to the keyboard. When I try to enter my password, extra characters are being added when I type. For example, when I type an "e" or "s", there is an extra character automatically added. The same happens when I type certain
 numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened last year and I remember I found that a certain combination of holding down function keys and other keys remedied the problem, but I do not remember the combination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is happening when I am trying to unlock my computer since it's password protected, I cannot access any programs or the control panel, only the home screen where you enter your password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any quick solutions so I can get into my computer for work, it would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Win10 activation is embedded into the BIOS, so as with previous Windows the motherboard is the main issue.</p>
<p>You shouldn't need to worry about using a different cpu and having to reactivate, or not being able to</p>
<p>reactivate, should that be required,&nbsp; if you have the original key. </p>
<p>But the benefit of a cpu upgrade on an aging machine may be in question. An upgrade from dual core
</p>
<p>to quad core <em>may</em> show some improvement. What are you wanting to achieve with another cpu ?</p>
<br />
<p>- ASUS does not supply Win10&nbsp; Chipset or Management Engine drivers for this model motherboard.</p>
<p>Sure Win10 will run without them, but if your machine is not performing as well on Win10 as it did with
</p>
<p>Win7 this may be the reason. </p>
<p>Depending on your current cpu model, you may also need to update the BIOS if you change up to a
</p>
<p>newer model cpu.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro4 flickering screen.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings to you,</p>
<p>My surface pro 4 is 1.5 years old and is out of warranty. Last night, all of a sudden the screen started flickering when left untouched for 5 seconds, howevere it resolved when i touched it or used the keyboard, but it is not feasible to work with constantly
 keeping a finger on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shut it down and prayed that it should resolve by itself. I read some queries amd comments on public forum thinking that it would help. Windows have suggested a replacement for many, but in my case, i doubt it can happen since I bought the surface pro
 in India and I live currently in Armenia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please guide me through this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: I have my master thesis project and I can't afford to waste time. This is my worst nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I have similar issue.&nbsp; Purchased my Surface Pro 4 in 2015.&nbsp; The last year has been horrible with screen shaking.&nbsp; I have no warranty at this point.&nbsp; All the information I have been able to find suggestions there is no answer, short of putting it in the
 freezer.&nbsp; I am currently starting a business from home that requires extensive use of my Surface and cannot be without it for long.&nbsp; There does not seem to be any correlation to when the screen shaking begins, on line or offline or any particular program.&nbsp;
 In fact it is happening right now as I type this.&nbsp; Is there any answers at this point as to how to fix the problem?

<div>Downloaded windows 8 about a month and a half ago. I have a Toshiba laptop that came with Windows 7; all I did was upgrade to windows 8.<strong><u><em> I purchased it, and have a valid serial key.<br />

Over the last week it's decided to start booting with this error, after an update released by Microsoft.<br />
&nbsp;A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem insert windows installation disc and restart your computer. Click "repair your computer."<br />
<br />
Error is:<br />
File: \boot\bcd<br />

            Hi Karan,
<br />
<br />Windows 11 is an Internet myth, there will be no Windows 11 
<br />
<br />When support for Windows 8 ends, Microsoft will re-brand Windows 10 to just Windows 
<br />
<br />The model Microsoft are using going forward is, twice yearly a new version of Windows (called a Feature Update) will be released. That feature update will include any new Functionality and features available for Windows and will deprecate older features 
<br />
<br />That way, once your PC is up to date, you will always have the latest version of Windows. This is something like the Office 365 model, with the one exception, Windows 10 feature updates are free and there is no subscription .

            Hi Kara
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What happened to Windows 9?
<br />
<br />There was never a Windows 9, Microsoft skipped this number and went to 10 instead. Company officials decided to choose 10 because they believe this release is a 'Perfect 10' and to also signify this is the last major release of Windows. There will still be revisions of Windows 10 called Feature Updates, just don't expect there to be a Windows 11, Windows 12 etc.
<br />
<br /> Initially revealed at BUILD 2014 as a minor update called ‘Threshold’, Windows 10 was originally intended be a minor Update 2 for Windows 8.1. Somewhere along the way, plans changed and the operating system evolved into the major revision we have today.
<br />
<br />Microsoft releases revisions two times per year, in the Spring (March to May) and Fall (September to October).
<br />
<br />So far, these have been releases of Windows 10:
<br />
<br />- Windows 10 1507 - July 2015 (first version)
<br />- Windows 10 1511 - November 2015 (also called the November Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1607 - August 2016 (also called the Anniversary Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1703 - March 2017 (also called the Creators Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1709 - October 2017 (also called the Fall Creators Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1803 - April 2018 (also called the April Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1809 - October 2018 (also called the October Update)
<br />- Windows 10 1903 - May 2019 (also called the May Update) 
<br />
<br />Microsoft currently working the next two versions, that might be called Windows 10 1909 and Windows 10 2003.

I have an @comcast.net email account and use Outlook 2007 to manage my office mail. My associate also has the same email domain and I keep trying to convince him to use Outlook, but he says that he has file folders on his Comcast account that he likes to have
 access to from anywhere, and that they wouldn't download to Outlook even if he started using it.<br />
Any ideas to prove him wrong? How do I get file folders from previous email accounts on a webpage to my Outlook account?

            Unless the ISP offers IMAP service, basically you don't.&nbsp; POP service only knows about one server folder, the Inbox, and, unless told to do otherwise, will download everything it finds in the Inbox, then delete it from the server.&nbsp; By contrast, IMAP leaves
 everything on the server and will produce and populate local folders that match the online folders.&nbsp; Sady, Comcast does not appear to offer IMAP service, so he's probably better off using the web interface.<br />

                    I'm using Vista Home Premium and constantly reminded of 8 updates that always fail to download/install. I attempted to manually install, and the failure info states that the updates aren't compatible with my version of Windows. ???? If that's the case,
 why are they there? Anyway, if these particular updates aren't compatible and won't download, can they be deleted from Windows Update?<br />

            All I want to do is get them out of the current update queue so they don't keep coming up.<br />
<br />
(1) It was custom-made in January 2009 by the guy who has been building my systems for 15 years.<br />
<br />
(2) I'm using Security Essentials. No third party firewall.<br />
<br />
(3) I would NEVER install either Norton or McAfee and neither has ever been on this system.<br />
NOTE: When I was having spyware issues a couple months ago, I used Malware Bytes and Vipre, both of which found and removed viruses. Once I ran virus-free scans with all three programs and determined the drive to be malware-free, I uninstalled Malware Bytes
 and Vipre and currently running only Essentials.<br />
<br />
(4) As mentioned, this is a custom-built system, so all installations were fresh by my choosing.<br />
<br />
(5)<br />
(a) yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
(b) yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
(c) yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
<br />
(6) 11/30/2009<br />
<br />
(7) Never. I don't use IE.<br />
<br />
(8) Yes, I use Firefox. Don't use Chrome, so considering uninstalling.<br />
<br />
(9) Version 6, Update 24 (a newer version is available)<br />
<br />
(10) Yes, a repair was done a couple months ago when one of my RAID drives went out. I'm now using the other drive in single mode.<br />
<br />
(11) I've never used any registry cleaners or any other "system optimizer" at the suggestion of the guy who builds my systems.<br />
<br />
BTW, I very much appreciate you taking the time to help.<br />

            (1) I believe it was Trend Micro, which is what I'd been using in previous systems.<br />
<br />
(2) It was in March, 2012. Don't recall the exact date. It was done by the person who builds my systems when one of my RAID drives went down.<br />
<br />
(3) I intentionally chose to install it.<br />
<br />
(3b) Tuesday, Feb 1, 2011<br />
<br />
(3c) 4.0.1526.0<br />
<br />
(4) Not that I'm aware of. I have updates set to inform me of new updates and give the option to download/install, and have always unchecked any Explorer 9 updates. The guy who builds my systems told me to stay away from it. The only updates I see in update
 history involve IE8, although I just found a "Windows Internet Explorer 9 for Windows Vista" update that failed on 1/17/12. Must have missed that one when unchecking IE9 updates. There were several other failed updates on that date, mostly security updates.<br />
<br />
(5) I've only opened IE8 a couple times but appeared to work okay.<br />

(6) 5/1/2009<br />

            <p><strong>PART ONE: DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • You've got&nbsp;a very complex problem on your hands, the most perplexing being&nbsp;the installation&nbsp;failure of
<strong>Security Update for .NET Framework 2 SP2 (KB2604094)</strong>.</p>
<p>KB2604094 [MS12-035] supersedes (replaces) three (3) previous updates: KB2518866 [MS11-044], KB2572075 [MS11-078] and KB2633874 [MS12-016] -
<em>only the last one is currently installed</em> according to your replies&nbsp;yet <em>
all of them</em> predate the Repair Install of Vista in March 2012!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • If we can't get KB2604094 and all of the other updates installed <em>very</em> soon, I'm afraid your only recourse will be formatting the HDD &amp;&nbsp;then doing a Clean Install of Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Note: If you haven't gotten Java v1.6.0_31 (or higher) installed yet (and
<em>all</em> older Java versions removed), take care of this <em>right now!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>PART TWO: QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>1. Is Silverlight v4.1.10329.0 (or higher) installed?</p>
<p>2. Open <strong>Update History </strong>&amp; tell me the error number associated with the failed install of
<strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9 </strong>on 17 January 2012?</p>
<p>3. Is Java v1.6.0_31 (or higher) installed installed and have all older versions been removed?</p>
<p><em>After writing down your answers to #1 thru #3 above, proceed to... </em></p>
<p><strong>PART THREE: ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>1. Run the System File Checker tool in hopes that doing so might resolve your current problems. See the first subsection (<em>only!</em>) of the MORE INFORMATION section on this page:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Note: The tool will generate a log (i.e., sfcdetails.txt) you may wish to review but I don't need you to post the log in a reply to this thread (for now).&nbsp; I just want you to run the tool.</p>
<p>2. After running System File Checker, reboot the computer then run a manual check for updates &amp; see if those missing updates will install now.</p>
<p>&nbsp; • HOW TO run a manual check for updates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date</a></p>
<p><strong>PART FOUR: STATUS REPORT</strong></p>
<p>Reply to this post with a status report. In your reply, include your answers to Questions #1 thru #3 above. If you were able to install
<em>any updates </em>after running System File Checker, state the KB number(s) of the update(s) which installed as answer #4.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Just ran the System File Checker tool, rebooted, checked for updates and located the same eight it says I need to install, however, they won't download and I continue to receive the "Failed" notification.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in earlier posts, I'm aware of the issue so am planning to do a complete system upgrade when my current magazine layout obligations are finished in late June. I plan to go with a new, larger HDD, Win 7, etc. I recently purchased a new laptop
 with Win 7 and like the OS. I'm just thankful my main system is running well in spite of the problems, but it's time for an upgrade and as you say, a clean install.<br />
<br />
Robear, thanks again for all the help and time you've given to my problem. Enjoy the holiday as well. Yes, I'm in the U.S. ..in Huntsville, AL.<br />

            <p>Photo Gallery is just viewing the Pictures Library stored on the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open My Computer and open Pictures. You should find a series of folders with the date of import as the folder name. Ctrl + A will select all of the folders then drag it over to the backup device on the left side. If using an Optical disk (USB key would be
 better) open the disk and it should advise that you have files waiting to be written so burn the disk. Particularly if using Optical disks then make 2 separate disks and whenever possible do not burn at the highest speed</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a overall system backup utility available in Control Panel but his creates a single backup file which must be restored in order to access the contents. When dealing with a single library such as Pictures then it is simpler to just drag them to a
 different device as individual files.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply. </p>
<p>

 backup using the second article above I found the following screen which I could not find on my PC. The equivalent did not have any option where I could tell it where to put the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f15376_en_1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part of the problem is that nowhere can I find a comprehensible explanation of how I should use this backup if had I managed to create it and knew where it was. How would I use it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I use an image cloning program weekly to clone my HDD and have used that for recovery purposes quite successfully in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the slight ramble above but I am still confused by the non-existent backup drive which I had disconnected.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time responding back to us. Backing up <strong>all</strong> of your personal files and programs would need an external drive and it has to be connected to your PC. If you wish to back up the images from your PC, you wouldn't need any external
 drive to do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have more questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. However, my settings screen&nbsp;for setting up backup is different from the one which is displayed in your procedure. I have connected an external hard drive and my PC no longer complains about a disconnected hard drive so presumably that
 is hwere the backup is being put.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which part of Windows10 on the PC tells me where the backup is being put and what it might be called?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello. See if this link from HTG answers your question. I'm glad to see that your interested in creating a back up image of your OS. I wish that everyone would learn how to create a back up image. It will make you a fearless user, knowing you can restore
 your PC back exactly like it was the day you created the image.</p>

            I have more questions now. Where is the Back-up being put and how would I recognise it? Also, do I have a choice of where to put this backup and finally, why is the screen on my PC (Windows 10) not similar to that shown in my earlier reply? (19/Sept/17)

<p>Hi Gray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>To look through the contents of the backup, select&nbsp;<strong>Browse for files</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Browse for folders</strong>. When you're browsing for folders, you won't be able to see the individual files in a folder. To view individual files, use the&nbsp;<strong>Browse
 for files</strong>&nbsp;option.</li><li>To search the contents of the backup, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search</strong>, type all or part of a file name, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any questions or things you'd like to clarify, feel free to ask.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<p>WHERE does Windows 10 place these backups and what are they called?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for this question is that I created a number of folders some time ago called 'Backup' and 'Downloads' and the discovered that Microsoft introduced a 'Downloads' folder in an upgrade to Windows. My Downloads folder preceded Microsoft's by around
 10 years. I had to make arrangements to merge the folders.</p>

<h2>            is there a mouse only driver for microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse&#63; The &#34;Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3&#34; driver&#47;software is not compatible with my other keyboard ...</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went on the microsoft webpage to download the driver/software for my "Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse", but the only driver/software they have listed is the "Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3" , which seems to be for both their mouse and keyboard... I
 tried to install that , but after installing that my other non-microsoft brand (i-rocks brand) wireless 2.4 ghz keyboard no longer connect to its receiver and i am unable to use the keyboard. I tried resynciing and everything but nothing works as long as that
 "mouse and keyboard center 2.3" driver/software is installed, so now I have to uninstall that, and just use the regular driver for the "microsoft scultp ergonomic mouse" i have, so I can use my keyboard... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know, are there other older verison of mouse only driver/software that i can use with my "ms scultp ergonomic mosue" ? &nbsp;maybe the latest intellipoint mouse driver would work?? what is the latest version and how do i find it? &nbsp; &nbsp;or only the "mouse
 and keyboard center 2.3" would works with that mouse? &nbsp;so in that case, i have no choice but to use the generic mouse driver?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance for the help!</p>

            <p><br />
</p>
<p>I finally figured it out. Apparently when installing the "Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3" software/driver for the "microsoft scultp ergonomic mouse", &nbsp;it will install both the mouse driver and its matching keyboard driver as well, even though I don't own
 that keyboard. &nbsp;I tried that same software with my old microsoft natural wireless laser mouse 7000 and that time it only installed the mouse driver. I &nbsp;am guessing the nano receiver for the scultp ergonomic mouse can receive both the ergonomic mouse and the
 ergonomic keyboard??? . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the software installed one "microsoft USB Dual Receiver Wireless Mouse" under "Mice and other Pointing Device" in Device Manager and one "microsoft USB Dual Receiver Wireless Keyboard" under "Keyboard". &nbsp;What I did is just go into Device Manger and uninstalled
 the "microsoft USB Dual Receiver Wireless Keyboard" driver and checked the box to &nbsp;"delete the driver software for this device" so that keyboard driver won't come back, and leave the just installed microsoft mouse driver be, so now I only have the "microsoft
 USB Dual Receiver Wireless Mouse" and the generic keyboard driver "HID Keyboard Device" in Device Manager instead of the unwanted microsoft one, now I can go ahead and install any brand wireless/wired keyboard and the microsoft keyboard driver won't be interfering
 with it anymore .</p>

    <title>Out-of-the-box compatibility list of printers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> netprinter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Out-of-the-box compatibility list of printers</h2>
                    I am at a point where Microsoft and HP point at one another about supplying an XP driver for an older printer to allow networked printing for Vista and Win 7 systems.&nbsp; If I upgrade the print server to Win 7, what printers are supported? Is there an out-of-the-box
 compatibility list of any kind (any printer manufacturer)?

<h2>            No Audio Output Device Is Installed, Really Need Help</h2>
                    <p>Hello community</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is my first time posting here, i really need some help</p>
<p>so the problem first happened after i updated my windows a couple months ago, the audio symbol on the bottom shows a red cross, if I hover my mouse over it, it says "no audio output device is installed". i searched the internet on how to solve this and tried
 almost everything and nothing works except one. what i did was</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>on device manager (all of my sound drivers have yellow exclamation mark on them)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;disabling-enabling driver(doesnt work), </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;update the driver automatically and manually (doesnt work, the result is my driver is already up to date),</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;uninstall the driver then reinstall (doesnt work)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;uninstall the driver then do scan for hardware changes (doesnt work)</p>
<p>on the device properties it says "Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device...."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-on cmd.exe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;disable integrity check</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;turned off test signing</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only thing worked is to do driver signature enforcement via advanced startup, but every time i restart the computer, the problem resurfaced, and i have to do the driver signature enforcement again. now the problem has gotten worse. i need to turn off
 driver testsigning to be able to launch an application. this can be done by typing a command on cmd.exe then do a restart, but then the problem happens again, if i do the driver signature enforcement, the driver testsigning turns back on</p>

<p>Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code

    <title>Internet connectivity slow after Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bolehill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connectivity slow after Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the dreaded Windows 10 Anniversary Update, my internet connection on my PC has been as slow as a slow thing.</p>
<p>It is ONLY the PC running Windows 10 that is affected - my Android phone and my iPad all continue to connect and wotk quickly and fine, so that means there is no problem with router, modem or my actual connection or my ISP.&nbsp; The problem is ONLY with the
 Windows PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every fix I can find on the internet (via my iPad), have looked for updates to network adapter drivers (none available), have uninstalled my 3rd Party anti-virus software, checked all DHCP settings, changed all IP addresses to fixed addresses,
 and still it is slow, slow, slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Lenovo desk top, windows 10 home with all updates installed.&nbsp; I have both a Realtek on-board ethernet adapter and a Netgear wireless adapter (both are NOT connected at the same time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, can anyone hlep?&nbsp; The connection was fine and used to run at full speed before the Anniversary Update, but now.......................... And Microssoft don't seem to even realise that they have caused this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I await in anticipation to be put out of my misery.</p>

            <p>Thanks Marco.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had done most of the things in this troubleshooter before I posted my query - that's why I posted the query on the forums.</p>
<p>The only thing I have not done is the 'last resort' network reset option, primarily because I now use fixed IP addresses for my network adapters and I don't want to lose those setiings.</p>
<p>Nothing else in the troubleshooter made any difference - no errors listed in the network report, driver updated for one of the adapters (other one up to date), resetting everything made no difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, given that all the 'standard' procedures have been tried and make no difference, have you or anybody else got anything to sugest that might actually work (I have been working to resolve this problem, off and on, for over 2 months now, so have tried just
 about everything that everyone and anyone has suggested).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, can somebody please get onto Microsoft and get them to fix the errors thay are causing because of their badly thought through Updates?&nbsp; Given that they caused the problem in the first place, I think they should fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing changed here from before the Anniversary Update to after it - no new hardware; no changes to the physical location of PC, router or modem; no different way of connecting,;no new software installed, EXCEPT the Update.&nbsp; Hence, Microsoft are the culprit
 and they should fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you with your issue, we suggest that you check internet and network speed and let us know about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you check your manufacturer's website if there is an updated driver for your network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Angela.</p>
<p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you explain what exactly you mean by 'check internet and network speed', and please could you advise how I go about this?&nbsp; Where/how do I get this information to share back with you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, when clicking the 'reply' button to create this response, I had to do it twice (no response at all the first time) and the second time, the circle timer came up and it took over 15 seconds to open the reply
 box.</p>
<p>I don't think that is at all satisfactory.&nbsp; Before the Anniversary Update, this would have taken less than 2 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, why is it always the 3rd party manufacturers who have to sort out Microsoft's problems?&nbsp; You know as well as I do all the issues that this Anniversary Update has created in PCs around the world, why isn't it Microsoft that sorts out the mess it
 creates?&nbsp; Why do we, the users, and the 3rd party manufacturers, have to go around with the proverbial bucket of water to do all the work to clean up Microsoft's mess?</p>

            <p>OK, I have checked for software updates on manufacturer's websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an update for my Netgear Wireles LAN (USB attached to PC), and I have updated that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scans of my PC for the onboard Realtek adapter (RTL8188CE Wireless Lan 802.11n PCI-E NIC) say that the driver is up to date (I have version 2013.12.331.2016, dated 31 March 2016 installed) . The Realtek website is naff - you have to be a technical wizard
 to understand what you are looking for.&nbsp; Alternative driver scanners suggest an updated driver is available, BUT its date is earlier than mine and the version number ends in 2012 so I am assuming that is older.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having updated the Netgear driver - wow, first time I connect to the internet, it's fast.&nbsp; Second time - back to slower than a slow thing.&nbsp; This is what happens every time I make some change to the way I connect (say switch from one adapter to the other)
 - the very next time, the connection is fast, then it goes to slow.&nbsp; It's as if Windows makes a change to settings after that first connection that then slows me down EVERY time thereafter - until I make another change to an adapter setting (e.g. to use a
 fixed IP address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrated and very fed up now.&nbsp; Leaving Microsoft copletely very soon if this goes on much longer.</p>

            <p>Hi Angela</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your latest reply, which leads to three things in response:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I note that you haven't yet answered the query in my post of 10th November, namely:&nbsp; "Please can you explain what exactly you mean by 'check internet and network speed', and please could you advise how I go about this?&nbsp; Where/how do I get this information
 to share back with you?"&nbsp; Could you answer that please, as you obviously thought it was an important step for me to take and I have not been able to take it yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If you think there is a problem with my Netgear adapter, why do you not seem to think that there is not one also with the on-board Realtek adapter, which suffers from EXACTLY the same problems when I connect through that instead of the Netgear adapter?&nbsp;
 And why should Netgear know the answer to the problem that is caused by Microsoft?&nbsp; If they know the answer, then surely a firm as massive as Microsoft does also?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Finally, and perhaps most relevant, why on earth should the problem be with BOTH the adapters in the first place?&nbsp; They were working 100% fine (i.e. I had decent speed internet access without go slows and freezes) up to the point that the Anniversary
 Update installed itself on my PC.&nbsp; Ever since then, I have had the problems described in this thread.&nbsp; Are you trying to tell me that that is a pure conicidence and instead, at the very moment that the Update was installed, BOTH adapters started to have problems
 that were nothing to do with Micrsosoft's Update?&nbsp; If so, you really must think I am totally stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Neil Stuart</p>

            <p>To check your network speed, you can do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, then choose <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Ethernet </strong>tab.</li><li>Tap in <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Ethernet </strong>or your WIFI (whichever connection you use) under<strong> View your active networks</strong>. Speed is displayed under
<strong>Connection</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To check your internet speed, you can go to this <a href="http://speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this happens to both adapters, we suggest you running the System File Checker so we can also make sure that your operating system is in good condition. Steps to do that are listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Type <strong>command </strong>in the search box.</li><li>&nbsp;Press <strong>Control </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>Enter </strong>
button on your keyboard.</li><li>&nbsp;Enter your credentials on the permission dialog box, then click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Enter <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> in the black box with a blinking cursor.</li><li>&nbsp;Wait for the System File Checker to scan for <strong>msvcp_win.dll</strong>.
<br />
</li><li>&nbsp;Follow the on-screen commands.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>

            <p>Thanks for yoru latest reply, Angela.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the speed test results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network speeds:</p>
<p>Netgear Wireless: 26 Mbps</p>
<p>Realtek Ethrnet connection: 100Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet speed (via the speed checker in the link you included in your last message):</p>
<p>Download: Test 1: 7.31 Mbps, Test 2: 7.27 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload: 1.04 Mbps both tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are consistent with what I believe my potential and actual speeds are, based on my local connectivity and past experience.&nbsp; However, I am definitely not getting that download speed at the moment on any internet connection.&nbsp; For example, it yet again
 took over a minute to get the "reply" screen wehn I clicked on 'Reply' at the bottom of your last message on this forum site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sending the information in this reply now, and will then do the other check you asked me to do and let you know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Resolution messed up after refresh.</h2>
                    I'm on windows 8.1, and my PC was running slower than its norm. So I decided to do a system refresh, and after the refresh was completed, my resolution is not what my monitors resolution is. I have a 1920x1080, 27 Inch monitor and I'm getting black bars.
 Before the refresh, I had no black bars and my resolution was fine.
