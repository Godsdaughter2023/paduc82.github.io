<h2>            How to reinstall latest mahjong version on windows 10</h2>
                    Windows 10 comes with a great new version of Microsoft Mahjong.&nbsp; It was uninstalled in error and I can only install the earlier version from the App store.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I reinstall the latest version?

            <p>Hi Kiran and thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the latest mahjong version is not installed I don't have its number.&nbsp; The older version is 2.4.1412.2202.&nbsp; &nbsp;Naturally this was the version we expected when downloading to windows 10 and we were delighted with the updated game - same background but with
 profile changes to the tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All very puzzling but thanks for your interest and I guess it will sort itself out eventually!</p>

<p>Badger is most likely correct. It does look like Bloodrayne 2 made the list though!

            It is best to not have two antivirus software running at the same time. You can have them installed but both should not be running real time protection at the same time as it could cause conflicts.
<br />
<br />
Does Microsoft Security Essentials find a problem?<br />
<br />
If the scan does not find the problem, then make a backup of the registry and then delete the entry for
<br />
1E4E2003. <br />
<br />
Then reboot and see if you still get any errors when running Spybot or Microsoft Security Essentials.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi Shirley.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can install Grammerly's editor to Windows 10, or install it's extension to any browser you use so it is there when you are browsing the web online.
<br />
<br />See how this works here:  <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000090871-How-does-Grammarly-work-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles...</a>
<br />
<br />Then download and install the Windows 10 app to Windows, or install the browser extension to your browsers, or all of these if you want from the download links here:  <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000090831-Can-I-download-Grammarly-onto-my-computer-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>After upgrading successfully to Windows 8 from Windows 7, everything set up very well. I am connected to my Live, Outlook, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. I can see my OFFLINE contacts but not ONLINE ones. When I go to Messenger, I receive that
 error message. I an unlinked and relinked all of the accounts and nothing. When I go to the Live website, I can see all my online contacts and message successfully. The failure is only in the Metro People and Messaging apps. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled
 both to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

            I know this is an old post but in case it is helpful for the future, here was my personal solution to the same error message "Sorry, we can't save this information right now. Please try again later" when I tried to update my profile picture on the msn
 website. The problem I think was that the file size of the picture I was trying to use was too large. It was 6 mb and I think the limit was 4 mb. I downsized my picture and my 2nd attempt with the smaller file size worked right away. Hope that helps!<br />

<h2>            Accidently installed Windows 8 twice. How do I remove the bad install of Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Big mistake in installing. Please somebody help !</em><br />
<br />
I tried to upgrade to win 8 from 7 and accidently created two win 8 start up. How do I install win 8 now so I will only have one ? Basically it asks me which I would like to boot to. They both say windows 8&nbsp;. One is good the other gives me an error message.&nbsp;Should
 I reformat my hard drive and then reinstall win8 ? That would completely erase my hard drive. The only thing is that I thought you were supposed to have a copy of some previous windows on your computer to use the upgrade pro. Please help me with this !
</p>
<p>Update! I tried to format my hard drive and I don't believe it did.&nbsp;After I went through the process of setting up my computer again it had a few things I had downloaded and the 2&nbsp; ( I guess partitions) were still there. The first one is bad and the second
 one is good.</p>

            <p>Boot into the working installation of Windows 8:</p>
<span>
<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If you create a installation DVD or Bootable thumbdrive, you can use that to reinstall Windows. First, you will need to reinstall the qualifying license, then start the upgrade again to Windows 8. Qualifying license means you will either need to reinstall
 Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>A workaround for this situation is to create a system image of Windows 8 just after you have upgraded. So if your drive does crash, you can simply restore the image on a new hard disk or restore the image on the same drive if you just want to reinstall Windos
 8.</p>
<p>See the following for instructions about how to create a system image of your Windows 8 installation:</p>

            <p>I had dual operating systems at start up on windows 8 and only one operating system&nbsp;worked. This is how I removed it and it worked fine. hope this helps it took me a while to find out how to do it.</p>

<h2>            Is the power of the Xbox One X being wasted on 4k&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well the title poses the question and I have to say, I think the power of the X.B.O.X is being wasted on the chase for 4k.<br /><br />Rather than 4k and 30 frames per second as the standard, outside those handful of Microsoft first party games that will manage 4k 60fps of course, wouldn't developers be better of aiming for a rock solid 60 frames per second at 1440p or 1080p.<br /><br />Perhaps I am alone here but I think that 60 frames per second would provide a better gameplay experience and bumping up to 1440p would also provide a visual improvement.<br /><br />So what do you guys think? Should I be hungry for the 4k revolution or are frames per second what I should be using to sate myself.</p>

            <p>I don't see how 60 frames per second in every game would be a waste at all. You mention Tomb Raider, so I'll go with that. 60fps can make a world of difference in the game, it feels more responsive just moving Lara and aiming is a easier.<br /><br />Sure you don't need 60fps in Tomb Raider but it sure makes it a smoother experience.<br /><br />In a world (said in my best movie announcer voice) where gameplay is king, I just find it odd that visual fidelity is the priority over something that aids gameplay far more.<br /><br /></p><blockquote> 
 <p /><p>How about we let the developers decide what they want the game to run at.<br /></p> 
 </blockquote> <p>Then we would have nothing to discuss here if that was the line of thinking everyone employed, it is after all a comment intended to stop discussion instead of facilite it. An odd line of thinking to have on a discussion forum I think.</p>

Saying that, I'm a Lara fan from waaay back... her first game was actually designed for the "underpowered" (by 3D conventions) Sega Saturn circa 1996.

            <p>Well playing Tomb Raider at 30 frames per second can certainly be a great experience. I certainly thought so when playing it on the 360. Then I had the opportunity to play the game on a friend's PC and the difference in control&nbsp;was night and day (and I was using a wired 360 controller to play it.) It's the same game but just feels better to play.<br /><br />I have started playing the Definitive Edition on my Xbox One and yes it is still the same great game that it was, going back to that 30 frames per second though is noticeable. It just doesn't feel as good.<br /><br />I have the Saturn version of Tomb Raider, the receipt still taped inside from when I bought it all those years ago.<br /><br />So the big push for 4k seems odd for me when the BIG complaint about the Xbox One wasn't on how the games looked but the frame rate at which the games ran.<br /><br />4k is the new 3D that TV manufacturers are pushing in order to sell new units.</p>

What's worth remembering is that a good number of Xbox "exclusives" already have that optimal 60fps locked in - be it *every* Forza game, Gears of War Ultimate, Halo MC Collection, Halo 5 Guardians.

            <p>And another thing about latency. Even though X will have GDDR5, take a look at Xbox One's history since November 2013! It uses DDR3.

And Xbox 360's memory runs of GDDR memory too.

I can't imagine Xbox One X having the kind of bad UI performance that Xbox One had........... with DDR3!!! in November 2013! </p>

You should still be able to play if you are invited to matches OP. But as mentioned above your stats are lost on this gamer tag. If you wanted to rank up and play the game as normal then another new account would need to be created.&nbsp;<br />
And to add to the above users post after you have gone to the dashboard directly from the game lobby you are in turn off the console. That is the only way to ensure you do not carry an infection mod into another lobby.<br />

<p>If you'll excuse the expression... wow. Surely time for something to be done. There seems to be thousands of posts in the 'my account has been banned' forum thread daily, there seems to be more infections on live than in a dock yard and still there is a
 laissez faire attitude from developers and to some extent Microsoft.</p>
<p>The man hours alone for dealing with the bans must be huge, let alone folk getting banned whining and then folk like myself quitting Gold until it's sorted.</p>
<p>The dashboard trick is all fine and well, but it is somewhat a horse/bolted situation. Whilst I am sure the XBL staff are very busy just now, surely they want more time to goof off and play games?</p>

<p>"Laissez faire attitude"? Have you seen account suspensions lately? That's just the tip of the iceberg, if you look at the dodgy sites and on YouTube you'll see many more people who were caught using hacks and infections and been banned as a result. If they
 were adopting a "laissez faire attitude" then account suspensions would be empty, the enforcement policy wouldn't have been changed to reflect the rise of infections and Black Ops &amp; Reach wouldn't have the level of security Treyarch &amp; Bungie have adopted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COD4/WaW/MW2's downfall has been horrible to watch but people keep buying them, playing them and downloaded the map packs regardless, MW2 is also the darling of the COD fanbase in spite of how broken it has been since release. No one is forcing people to
 play those games, MW2 became a modder's playground about three weeks after release and it still topped the XBL most played list even post Black Ops and the Stimulus/Resurgence packs were the most downloaded on XBL when released. That says to a publisher and
 developer that the COD fanbase are not all that bothered that the game is guarded by a block of Swiss cheese and they're not going to bother fixing it as a result. If the COD fanbase had decided that no they wouldn't give Activision any more money until the
 game was fixed then it would've been sorted but no no they were all outraged by the modding but not outraged enough to give up their COD fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All MS can do is ban the modders, the onus is on the developers to fix their game and on the players of those games to press them to keep their game up to date or they'll take their business elsewhere.</p>

<p>Folks use the report system...I have seen several I know I reported complaining on the suspension forum...So it does work...When you get frustrated go read those forums...</p>
<p>Laugh along &nbsp;at the sheer stupidity and lack of common sense in those who get the ban hammer...</p>
<p>There is also a specific list of gamers who want to play legit on the WaW forum as well...But be warned we are aware of several who seem to have modded gamer scores....Your gamer score is calculated by the games achievements you get I've noticed a few upon
 review and they will hopefully be removed soon...And of course reported...</p>
<p>Modding/Hacking is not funny...us legit players don't care for it and those who engage in such behavior will get a ban..(Said in the hopes one of the idiots reads this)...Funny how some of them think it's funny and such and yet when you see their gamertag
 on the suspension forums you can't help but laugh....</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download Paint 3D</h2>
                    <p>Original title: <em>Paint 3D</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an Insider but have received and installed the Creators Update. I wanted to try Paint 3D, but cannot get the app to download by clicking on get in the app store. The warning says I have to have it installed on my hard drive. There is a response
 to a query on the Insider's thread that says you have to be an Insider to get the app, but it was written months ago during the test phase. I want to know what I need to do to get the 3D app. Do I still have to be an insider? I am not sure I want to risk crashing
 software to get that app.</p>

<p>Hi Mackenzie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like your concern is also similar to the original poster. Based on Devlin Sco's response, we suggest considering an upgrade to the latest build and version of Windows 10 to enjoy the Paint 3D feature. To get the update, check this article:

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that a third party app may be blocking the reinstallation of Paint 3D. To restore Paint 3D, we recommend that you copy and paste the command below in PowerShell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong><br />
</p>
<p>

I found a solution to the error 1079 compliments of TaterNutz</p>
<p>"Just go into the login properties of the service you are trying to start and select "This Account".&nbsp; Browse your computer and find the "Local Service" account.&nbsp; Wipe out the password so that it is blank and apply.&nbsp; You will be presented with a dialog stating
 the that the account has been granted the login as a service right.&nbsp; Then start your service.&nbsp; That should fix your problem.&nbsp; I have seen this issue countless times and there are many, many reasons why it could have happened but it's nothing to worry about.&nbsp;

    <title>Lost control of font size in Windows Live Mail after IE10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost control of font size in Windows Live Mail after IE10 update</h2>
                    <div>
<p><font>After the IE10 update recently, the font size increased (too large)&nbsp;in the reading pane for&nbsp;incoming email in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; If I reply to the email, the font size in the composition pane reverts to normal size; the problem only affects the reading
 pane.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Changing Mail-&gt;Options-&gt;Read 'Font size' has no effect.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Pressing ctrl-minus while in the reading pane reduces the font size to what it was prior to the IE10 update and should be.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>The font size&nbsp;I had prior to the IE10 update, and what I want, is the same size as the font WLM uses to display&nbsp;information in the header, eg., the date/time and address fields.&nbsp; Instead, what I'm getting is incoming email being displayed with a font
 size closer to the size of the subject line in the header; too large to be comfortable.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>(Font size in the composition pane is fine.)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>What should I do to get back control of the font size on the display of incoming email?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Thanks for your help!</font></p>

            If I understand your problem description correctly, I know what you mean. This has been a recurring problem with Windows Live Mail, which uses Internet Explorer functions for message display. I think it arises&nbsp;because each version of WLMail is designed
 to work with the current (at the time of development) versions of the IE libraries. When these change, with the introduction of a new version of IE or sometimes just a bi-monthly Cumulative Security Update, something changes in the way WLMail displays messages.<br />
<br />
Since installing IE10, I see the behaviour you describe. It applies particularly to plain text messages, where the font settings defined in program options are set aside in favour of some elusive 'default' settings. However, it doesn't always happen, and I
 haven't been able to pin down the trigger. When messages start being displayed with, say 12pt Arial instead of my preferred 10pt Courier New, it may be enough to close down the program, wait a few minutes and then re-launch it. If the display hasn't corrected
 itself, repeat the close/re-launch cycle. Whether the display changes back or not may depend on other factors, though, like whether IE is running or&nbsp;whether WLMail conducts some extensive housekeeping on shut-down or start-up. I haven't tested the behaviour
 rigorously in all the different situations. Sometimes it takes me by surprise and I suddenly notice that the display is as it should be.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there's little we can do about it. The IE developers clearly don't concern themselves with the possible effects their code changes might have on legacy programs like WLMail, and the most the WLMail developer(s) can do is adapt&nbsp;their code to the status
 quo. This will, of course, at worst only last until the next change in the IE DLLs.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, you may find that the same phenomenon affects the display of plain text files in Windows Explorer's preview pane. With IE9 installed, I seem to remember that the font used was Times New Roman. Now with IE10 it seems (at the moment) to be Courier
 New on my machine.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your high quality response.&nbsp; It sounds like you’re seeing similar problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If WLM has a dependency on IE, it’s surprising that it’s not handled better, given they are both Microsoft products; why not update them in parallel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know&nbsp;which mail client would Microsoft prefer desktop-centric customers to use?&nbsp; Outlook?&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that&nbsp;WLM stores email in individual files, which makes them easy to manage and accessible to the Windows search tool.&nbsp; AFAIK, Outlook uses&nbsp;big PST files
 to store mail.&nbsp; I've got Outlook, should I switch to it, can I make it store mail in&nbsp;elm files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like&nbsp;that your theory for the cause of the problem holds out the hope that Microsoft will fix it in an update.</p>

</blockquote>
<br />
Why not, indeed. It's a question of priorities. Internet Explorer is a battleship in the MS fleet, while WLMail is an obsolete minesweeper. The IE developers just don't care what havoc their changes wreak in this low-priority product, and the WLMail team -
 such as it is - have no influence on IE.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know&nbsp;which mail client would Microsoft prefer desktop-centric customers to use?&nbsp; Outlook?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Of course they would prefer everyone to use Outlook, which contributes significantly to their revenue. WLMail is a drain on resources, not least in the expense of supporting it through these forums.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've got Outlook,&nbsp;... can I make it store mail in&nbsp;elm files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
No. Outlook still uses its .pst pantechnicon files to store everything - e.g. mail messages, contacts, calendar events - with the attendant danger of losing everything if the file should get damaged.<br />
<br />

            <p>Thank you, thank you for that tip on how to change the font size from large to small (Ctl+-)!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been totally frustrated by this since installing IE 10 a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't anyone from Microsoft actually read these forums&nbsp;to hear that
 their customers are unhappy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not a programmer, but it would seem the problem shouldn't be so hard to 'fix'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I used to love Outlook Express.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it still around, and if I were to try to install it now, would I be able to transfer all of the emails that I have saved in Windows Live Mail to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Mel52350,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back. I understand that you want to use now Outlook Express. In case you want to install it on an operating system higher than Windows XP, there's a possibilty that it will not be installed. As for the exporting of your emails,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a>'s how you can get your emails from Windows Live Mail. To know if you can still get Outlook Express and if you will be able to import the exported emails from Mail, you can visit
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/2578?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Outlook Express Support</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you have other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Richard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently running Windows 7, so it sounds like there's just no going back to OE..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's frustrating to think&nbsp;that I'm just stuck with Windows Live Mail (WLM) as it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't the people at MS want to keep their
 customers happy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems&nbsp;such a simple request to make - that their features actually function!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, WLM&nbsp;came with this computer (I've had it about 2 years)&nbsp; so I just started using it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There didn't seem to be much different about it - at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed that I still had the capability of creating my own stationery, etc., but then that disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I've come to accept it for what it is, but sure wish the people at MS could do a little bit of tweaking to keep it's customers happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I HATE that you can't change the 'read' font size like you are supposed to be able to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your reply.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had exactly the same problem. &nbsp;I have the ASUS Vivo PC VM42, before upgrading to Windows 10, the Windows 8.1 worked fine. &nbsp;After the upgrading and rebooting, all I can see on TV is HDMI no signal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After weeks of struggling (I even sent it back to ASUS), I realized the display frequency was set to 62MHz as default in Windows 10, which my old TV doesn't support.&nbsp; All I had to do is running the Windows update in a friend's place using his NEWER TV
 and network, so that I can see and choose the 59 or 60 MHz option. Here's the path:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Advanced Display Settings &gt; Display Adapter Properties &gt; Monitor &gt; Screen Refresh Rate )
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When I brought it home and connect back to my old TV, it worked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, mine is a very old TV ASUS TLW320001 bought&nbsp;around 2008.&nbsp; If you had the same problem, don't rush to buy a new TV or monitor.&nbsp; Just use a newer display device and do the Windows Update.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that your HP a1483w does not have a OS at this present instant. You try to custom install Windows 10 but you get a message stating that couldn't find any drives. In this regard, we would ask you, is the Hardware components of your computer
 including the Hard disk etc., working properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, to resolve your issue, you can follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Disconnect all Other devices. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to disconnect all other device and try to setup Windows.&nbsp;<span><span>Start by unplugging un-needed hardware, expansion cards/card readers/DVD drives or any other peripheral devices connected to your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After going with Step 1, please follow the below step.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: Enable the Legacy Mode under the BIOS setting.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We would ask you to try to enable the Legacy mode under the BIOS settings and check if it helps.
</span></span><span><span>Also, please be informed that Windows 10 will continue to support legacy BIOS. For new devices that are launched a year after the release of Windows 10, they must have UEFI and Secure Boot enabled at the factory. However, this does
 not affect existing systems.H</span></span><span><span>ence, we&nbsp;advice you to enable Legacy Mode under BIOS settings.</span></span>

            <p>followed steps1:&nbsp; disconnected all peripherals except dvd player to be able to run iso setup.&nbsp; step 2: changed&nbsp;usb legacy&nbsp; support from auto to enabled.&nbsp; previously checked hard drive for errors before reformatting to clean NTFS. entered command prompt and
 checked system again but would only run 1st check 100%&nbsp;and stated could not run further checks.&nbsp; Vista OS was working with no glitches before reformatting. to clean drive.&nbsp; Have repeatedly run iso downloads for usb with 0511 version but could not eliminate
 media driver error.&nbsp; ran download twice on version 0511 using tech bench, image burn checking errors and ran rufus on both downloads getting same sha1 values on both. eliminated media driver error using above solutions and ran iso on dvd+r at lowest speed.&nbsp;
 was able to input key and go to custom advance setup but still after using all of the above solutions still get blank box showing no hard drive with remarks at bottom to install storage driver.&nbsp; Hard drive shows in bios and on power on screen at boot up.&nbsp;
 Reviewed all other tips but found none pertaining to this problem (most were tips for upgrading not clean install)</p>

<p>
</p><p>C: partition1 (NTFS)&nbsp; 131072 MB&nbsp;&nbsp; (130561 MB free)&nbsp; This is how I reformatted the drive to begin with.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the light of the information, we understand that when you try to install Windows XP pro, the hard disk shows up, but not while installing Windows 10. Also, you tried to run Windows 10 ISO downloads with USB rapidly but still the issue persists. Hence,
 we would kindly ask you to revert the query to the TechNet support team as they are able to assist you further in this regard.</p>

<p>Hi Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you mentioned that the numeric keys on your keyboard is not functioning right, I can only think of one thing. Another function of the numeric keys is to move the mouse pointer of your computer. This function can be turned on as part of Ease of Access
 for Windows. In most cases, this is the main reason why many users are reporting that the numeric keys are not working when you want to type a number. Regarding this, we can check if this function to move the mouse pointer is currently turned ON on your computer.
 Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Cortana</strong>, type <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel </strong>
and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Ease of Access</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that the <strong>Turn on Mouse Keys</strong> doesn't have a check on its box.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>to save the changes.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this doesn't resolve your issue and we will help you further.</p>

    <title>Cannot edit iPhone photos using Windows Live Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liz101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot edit iPhone photos using Windows Live Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <p>When I try to edit photos in Windows Live Photo Gallery, I get a message saying "This photo can't be saved because of a problem with the photo's file properties." &nbsp;This only happens with photos imported from my iPhone 5s; I'm able to edit the photos imported
 from my Canon camera. &nbsp;This had recently started to happen occasionally with my iPhone 4 but now happens with every iPhone 5 photo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows Live Photo Gallery for years with no problem. &nbsp;I'm using Windows XP and I just checked to be sure I have the most recent Windows Live update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that I have hundreds of photos that I can't use in Windows Live because I can't crop, rotate, or color correct them. &nbsp;If I export them to Picasa, I can edit them there. &nbsp;Is Windows Live now an outdated software that's not compatible with iPhone?
 Do I need to start using different photo editing software, and move all of my photos out of Windows Live?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've Googled the problem extensively online and can't find an answer that works. &nbsp;Very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Liz101,</p>
<p>Seems this is an known issue particularly in iPhone 5 onwards. </p>
<p>Please check this thread - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/gallery-files/problems-saving-editing-photo-sent-in-email-from/9c046893-3b4b-4a0e-9127-e9165fcba1a9">

<p>
</p><p>Have seen&nbsp;discussion thread &amp; seems error is due to metadata error of the photos taken and prob in rotation of photos&nbsp;in iPhone which is affecting importing photos in Photo Gallery, so if we remove or strip the metadata &nbsp;with&nbsp;some stripper prog then it allows
 editing. Also for rotating prob , one can use free prog like &nbsp;JPEG Lossless Rotator. Metadata error&nbsp;created in iPhone not&nbsp;allowed in&nbsp;Photo Gallery while others like Paint oversees it? &amp; looks like works in Windows 8 users. Since I don't have iPhone 5 so cant
 try them . While no prob&nbsp;in iPhone 4/iPod touch running iOS 6.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please check these workarounds as some of them&nbsp;have worked for iPhone users:</p>
<ul>
<li>While taking photos using iPhone, please hold it with vol buttons at bottom left, so you have to click it using left thumb to click using vol buttons.&nbsp;The these photos import correctly.</li><li>Turn off the HDR function in your iPhone and take a picture, such photos too are able to edit.</li><li>In Photo Gallery , make a copy of the photo by Ctrl C, and paste it by Ctrl V and the copy of the photo allows editing.</li><li>Check photo Properties in Explorer by right clicking it, and uncheck if Read Only, Hidden are checked</li><li>Also within Photo Gallery, open the Photo, clicking on the Create tab &gt; more tools&gt;Open with and open with paint. So when the photo open in Paint,&nbsp;Rotate it or rotate it back then Save it. Now try this again in Photo Gallery&nbsp;,&nbsp;its editable.
</li></ul>
<p>These are just workarounds and some of them might work. Try them and let oth users know if any of them helped.</p>

            Hi HAMANAH,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />Updating to Windows 10 1803, the latest feature update should resolve your issue.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got new Windows 8. I have icons on my desktop and every time I reboot, they get pushed to the left of the screen. I turned off the auto-arrange as well and it still does it. Any ideas on how to get Windows to remember and save my icon placements. Thank
 you for your help.</p>

            Hi Douglas
<br />
<br />When you click Print, choose Printer Properties
<br />
<br />Look for a 'Print to File' check-box and untick it . . 
<br />
<br />If you do not find that, open Devices and Printers form the old Control Panel, then right click that printer and choose Printer Preferences or Printer Properties
<br />
<br />On one of those, look for that 'Print to File' checkbox and untick it . . .

    <title>AHCI causes boot to hang &#40;Windows 7 Home Premium&#41; 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelonesoldier  say:</h3>
<h2>            AHCI causes boot to hang &#40;Windows 7 Home Premium&#41; 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from an old Gigabyte P55 motherboard with first generation i7 to a new MSI Z87 motherboard with 4th generation i7. The system works fine when SATA is set to IDE mode in the BIOS, but I have not been able to get Windows to boot in AHCI mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't remember if my previous motherboard was in IDE or AHCI mode.<strong> I ran the Microsoft Fix-It utility that is supposed to enable AHCI in the registry, and verified that the correct registry changes were made, but Windows will not boot.</strong>
 A more detailed description follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drivers disc for my new motherboard would not allow me to install the drivers while my old motherboard was still in the computer, so I switched without installing any drivers. When I finished installing the new mobo, I found the system would blue screen
 and reboot immediately after first displaying the Windows logo after POST. This issue also occurred&nbsp;when trying&nbsp;safe mode. I thought the problem was due to switching motherboards and not having the correct controller driver, so I used DISM to install all of
 the drivers from the CD that came with the MSI board (this was probably a bad idea but I was desperate).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This eliminated the blue screen, but caused the system to hang during the Windows logo instead. While researching the issue I realized the problem was related to AHCI and switched the SATA to IDE mode. The system booted, and I ran the chipset installation
 executable from the driver CD just to be safe. I then ran the Microsoft Fix-It tool from here
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922976?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922976?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system simply will not boot into Windows while AHCI mode is enabled. From what I've read, it sounds like making that registry change that the Fix-It utility makes is all that is needed, but that didn't do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My device manager lists<strong> Intel 8 Series/C220 Series 2 port Serial ATA Storage Controller - 8C08</strong> (version 9.4.0.1017) and&nbsp;<strong>Intel 8 Series/C220 Series&nbsp;4 port Serial ATA Storage Controller - 8C00
</strong>(version 9.4.0.1017) under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers. The MSI page for my motherboard has an Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver, but it says 7 series and gives me a "Platform not supported" error. The most recent RST drivers on Intel's download
 page also give a "Platform not supported" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can help me with this issue, I'd greatly appreciate it. I&nbsp;feel like&nbsp;my computer is bottlenecking on the IDE mode and I'd very much like to get on to AHCI.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As you said the old mother board driver might be conflicting.<br />
<br />
Why don't you perform a clean install?<br />
<br />
Save the backup of your data to your to external drive and perform clean install then see what happens.

            <p>I have no idea why, but this thread disappeared completely until I posted a new copy of it. Links to this thread in my email notifications and from Google said the thread did not exist, and it did not come up searching the Microsoft Answers forums. Then
 I posted a copy and it showed up. Then I deleted the copy and it disappeared. So I
<em><strong>have</strong></em> to have a duplicate copy to access the original thread. What gives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, why don't I perform a clean install? 1-2 hours to format the drive, ~2 hours to install Windows, 6-10 hours to install all of the Windows updates, ~2-3 hours to install all my drivers, an hour to download the Photoshop installer, an hour to extract
 the Photoshop installer, an hour to install Photoshop, an hour to download the Premiere Pro installer, an hour to extract the installer, an hour to install Premiere Pro, ... Flash CS5... Flash CS6... After Effects... Flash Builder... and that's just the tip
 of the iceberg of everything I have installed. Thirty plus hours of getting Windows back to where it was, requiring my constant attention clicking through dialogs, confirming restarts, launching the next installer...</p>
