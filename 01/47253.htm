<h2>            Very slow data transfer speeds Windows 10 PC to Windows 7 PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing very slow data transfer speeds between a Windows 10 PC to Windows 7 PC. I have tried about 15 different fixes including everything I can see on this forum and others, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 pc that I am trying to copy 750Gb of data from a Windows 7 laptop on my home network, and it cannot get above 1 Mbps speeds. Typically it is around 800 Kbps. I have tried cabled and WiFi connections. I have tried HomeGroup and
 standard Network folder sharing. I have tried file sharing apps like teracopy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My network adaptors do not have Large Send Offload (LSO) in advanced settings so I cannot disable that which seems to be one of the main fixes.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have wasted a whole day trying to sort this out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how I can fix this Microsoft, it is a very widespread problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speed when transferring data through network may vary depending on the size of each files. For example,
<span>if you try to copy a folder containing document files with more than 1 GB space. Then it might take longer time to copy the document folder as compared to copying a folder containing a video file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance. </span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I also have this problem, copying files between a Windows 10 PC and a Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Large Send Offload (LSO) fix and also the fix involving various "</span><span><span>netsh int tcp set ..." commands.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other network activity is fine, watching HD YouTube videos, downloading or uploading large (or small) files. The PC as a DLNA server streams 1080p without a glitch. Copying files locally from the same hard drive to an SSD is 128MB/sec. Wifi connection is
 114mbps (14.25MB/sec).&nbsp;Internet download is ~3MB/sec (upload 0.59 MB/s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only the Windows file sharing that is slow. Copying from Win10 PC to Win10 laptop using Windows Explorer varies around 300-800kB/sec and doesn't maintain a steady speed. It would actually be just as fast (or slow) to upload the files to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copying files from the PC to my phone has the same slow speed, so it seems to be a problem with Windows sending the file(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Rey Bel1, the symptoms are the same with many small files or one large one.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Please use following Steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Change your Windows display language</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To change your Windows display language (that's the language you see most often in Windows and apps), first add a language, download and install the language pack, and then follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, then tap Change PC settings.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the bottom-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click Settings, then click Change PC settings.)</p>
<p>2. Tap or click Time and language, and then tap or click Region and language. </p>
<p>3. Tap or click the language that you want to set as your display language.</p>
<p>4. Tap or click Set as primary to move the language to the top of the list. If the language can become your Windows display language, you'll see Will be display language after next sign-in appear under the language.</p>
<p>5. Sign out and then sign back in to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Add a keyboard layout for a language</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add a keyboard layout to a language if you want to use a different keyboard than the one that comes with the language.</p>
<p>To add a keyboard layout for a language</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, then tap Change PC settings.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the bottom-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click Settings, then click Change PC settings.)</p>
<p>2. Tap or click Time and language, and then tap or click Region and language.</p>
<p>3. Tap or click the language you want to add a keyboard to, and then tap or click Options.</p>
<p>4. Tap or click Add a keyboard, browse the input method list for the keyboard layout you want to use, and then tap or click it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make a keyboard your default keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set a keyboard as your default keyboard so you don't have to switch input methods to enter text with it, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Language in Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Add a language
 in the search box, and then selecting Add a language.</p>
<p>2. Tap or click Advanced settings.</p>
<p>3. Under Override for default input method, choose the keyboard layout you'd like to be your default keyboard, and then tap or click Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>thank you for the quick reply but none of the suggestions from&nbsp;<strong>Mahesh Kumar A&nbsp;</strong>helped me as they were just instructions of how to install languages and change the display language<br />
<br />
my problem in the middle of the steps as i explained before, the message "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">will be display language the next time you sign-in" does not show up when assigning a specific language as default language therefore
 the display language doesn't change from English after re-login into the computer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>also i may not have explained an &nbsp;important point that my friend is using windows 10 pro (same as i), but i have noticed that there isn't much difference between windows 8 and windows 10 in language settings&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />

<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store Error 0xC03f40C8 - &#34;Something happened and your purchase can&#39;t be completed.  Error code 0xC03f40C8&#34;</h2>
                    <p>"Something happened and your purchase can't be completed.&nbsp; Error code 0xC03f40C8"</p>
<p>Only happens when I try to get a new app from the Windows store (free or otherwise).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 10 hours with Microsoft premium support, and additional time with Dell support.&nbsp;&nbsp; No resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with multiple computers on windows 8.1 in my home network.&nbsp; Wired or wireless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I connect to any one of multiple&nbsp;cell phone hot spots outside of my home network, then there is no error and I can purchase the app, (free or otherwise), normally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue seems related to home network.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have turned off and on the firewall on my router.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have turned off and on my 2015 Norton security.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have tried without any security software installed on my computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have performed a factory reset on my new Dell XPS 12 computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these changes&nbsp;made the problem go away.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All other elements of web access and behavior are normal.&nbsp; It is just this one unique part of the windows store.

            I got another router from time warner cable. &nbsp;A technicolor to replace my arris 1670. &nbsp;Will replace this weekend. &nbsp;Now I'm seeing with other posts that technicolor router may have the same issue. &nbsp;If this does not work, then I'll go back and try to get
 arris 1672 which I asked for the first time but didn't give to me. &nbsp;Bottom line, since win store is the only flipping problem, my belief is that this is a Microsoft bug that needs to be fixed on the software side.

            Already tried all of your suggestions&nbsp;over a month ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same problem.&nbsp; I even went so far as to use paid Microsoft support and erases my entire drive and re-installed windows from scratch.&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem has been experienced by many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 It is a problem with&nbsp; Time Warner Cable customers only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It started occurring in May of 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The correct solution is for a Microsoft developer to get together with a TMC developer.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the only way this will get resolved unless Windows 10 magically
 corrects it upon its release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only issue is the mysterious Windows Store Error 0xC03f40C8 - "Something happened and your purchase can't be completed. Error code 0xC03f40C8".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No other elements of any other software is impacted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hello!<br />
<br />
Since it's a core component on Windows 10, it's pre-installed on the computer.&nbsp; The issue most like is that it's not associated with your Microsoft/Xbox Account.&nbsp; Make sure you are logged into the store with your Microsoft account.&nbsp; It should say that the application
 is already installed, but there should be an option for "Get".&nbsp; Clicking on this will register it to your profile and allow you to rate and review.

<p>Hey there Beb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you search the Xbox App from the Microsoft Store you should see 4 tabs not far below. It should say "Overview", "System Requirements"," Reviews", and "Related'. If the blue box says launch and not Get then you should be able to write a review and rate
 the app.</p>

    <title>Unable to edit&#47;save documents after upgrade to win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caryaltman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to edit&#47;save documents after upgrade to win10</h2>
                    <p>My upgrade to win10 seemed to go ok, but now upon needing to edit a spreadsheet and a couple of documents I have been working on in Office 2010, &nbsp;I realized that now with Win10, every document opens into a read only mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can not edit anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can
 not save a new copy of the document and then open that, it opens with the same problem.&nbsp; Also when trying to save a newly created document, I get an error that this can not be saved to this "network" location.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last I checked, My Documents is not on my network.</p>
<p>Then I realized that this problem was not just with office packages, but OpenOffice also can not save correctly.</p>
<p>I have been trying to resolve this all night to no avail.&nbsp; I have even gone to add/remove programs and forced Office 2010 to do a repair, and I rebooted afterwards...&nbsp; no change.</p>
<p>Lastly, I tried moving my Word document to the desktop to open from there.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the same problem occurred, the document or even a copy of it, still opens up in protected mode.</p>
<p>I hope there is a solution to this soon.&nbsp; At this point I am not even convinced that reverting back to Win7 will fix this.&nbsp; Help please!</p>

<p>Well Annu, it has been 9 hours and still no response.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been doing some reading in the meantime and I now realize that the errors that I am getting in my legally purchased Office 2010 Student and Home edition, are exactly what one would get if they
 had subscribed to the subscription version of office, and had allowed the subscription to expire.&nbsp; I have been disabled in the same way; I can open, read and print any document I have previously created; I can simply go no further with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this begs the following question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this an ooops or is this intentional?&nbsp; Have you discontinued Office 2010 as a price for the free upgrade to Win 10?&nbsp; I have to do my work in the morning, using Word and Excel.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can not do it with my present
 system, please tell me what I need to do to fix it.&nbsp; If I need to purchased something else to make this work, I need to know that ASAP.&nbsp; Do I recommend to my friends and co-workers to wait on the upgrade if there is a need for the Office package functionality,
 or do we need to plan to stay with Win 7?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you must be busy at Microsoft with this massive rollout, but these are your products and the fix should be obvious to you.&nbsp; Please send me my solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>You might want to read the solutions available to you in the <em>Win10 forum</em> instead of here in the
<em>Photoshop, frontpage &amp; Works forum</em>. You are much more likely to find a solution in the proper forum. Perhaps you should repost your question:

<p>I hope further replies don't blame the victim.&nbsp; File and folder permissions are awfully important things for getting work done, and it's essential for Microsoft to correct this quickly. Saying, "Well, you shouldn't have upgraded" isn't going to help a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same issue, after upgrading from fully patched, fully updated Windows 8.1 Home on a HP Envy desktop that is less than a year old.&nbsp; Trying to save any document results in the message that I don't have permission to save (in OneDrive), then
 asks if I want to save in Documents instead. When I click the "Yes" box, I get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed folder permission in both OneDrive and Documents from Read-only to Read and Write, but doing so did not help at all.</p>

<p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>No, the question has not been answered yet and I have rolled back to Win7 in the meantime so that I could again enjoy using Word and Excel, while you guys work out this bug.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rollback went fine and proved to me that Win10 ver 1.0 was not quite ready
 to go yet, especially when just on this thread there are 4 people with the same problem as me.</p>
<p>I have successfully upgraded all of my machines except this one to Win10,&nbsp; and even a small mini laptop with only 1gb of ram runs just fine with the new Windows 10 package and the ONLY problem I have seen so far has been this frustrating incompatibility
 with your own product!</p>
<p>Please let me know when you have a fix for this problem available so that I can complete my upgrade.&nbsp; To answer your question, this&nbsp;has NOT yet been resolved, although there have been attempts to answer it.&nbsp; Now that I have the attention of the Microsoft
 Community Team, 14 days into this issue, I am confident that a solution is immentent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your response and hopefully we will have this resolved soon, to the benefit of the entire community.</p>
<p>

<p>I had Office 2010 on Windows 7 (on both my desktop and laptop), on upgrading to Windows 10 something is messed up with permissions or something, and I (the administrator), have read only access to my documents, sometimes no access to the documents folder
 at all, and onedrive has access issues as well, where it can't access the documents folder either. Both PC's have exactly the same problem.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth support not showing in Services</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bluetooth mouse, that worked perfectly on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 update launched, it installed Windows 10, I backed up to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the bluetooth does not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this: </p>
<p>Uninstall my bluetooth driver in the Device Manager and search for changes in order to make it re-install. It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to Services trying to enable or refresh the Bluetooth support service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM : There is no Bluetooth support service anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just can't find a way to make my bluetooth work. (When I go to PC settings, there is no bluetooth widget too)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 DVD Maker</h2>
                    <p>I have made a picture DVD with Win 7 DVD Maker, and when previewed all looks ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try using a DVD player connected to a TV, part of some of the pictures ( all jpeg ) are missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried both aspec ratio's - 4.3 &amp; 16.9 &amp; recording in PAL format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried altering the TV aspect ratio's - wide, smart, 4/3 &amp; 14/9 but still no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions please.</p>

            You state "part of some of the pictures are missing"...<br />
I'm guessing you mean they look cropped as if the <br />
top and bottom are cut off?<br />
<br />
I suspect the ones being cropped are in the Portrait<br />
orientation. It may be worth a try to pre-crop the photos<br />
in an image editing program before importing into <br />
DVD Maker.<br />
<br />
If your Freestanding DVD player happens to be JPEG<br />
compatible (check the manual)...you could burn a simple <br />
Data DVD and the player will display them as a slideshow.<br />

            Hi <strong>Sls12,<br />
</strong><br />
I would suggest that you to open command prompt and run as an administrator. To do this follow the steps given below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click on start.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the Open box, type cmd, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right click on command prompt and click on “Run as an administrator”.<br />
4.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type the following line and press ENTER.<br />
regsvr32 odbcint.dll <br />
5.&nbsp;Close command prompt.<br />
After that running the application and check if issue persists or not.<br />
<br />
If the issue doesn’t get fixed perform a <strong>System File Checker</strong> [SFC] scan on the computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>The System File Checker tool</strong><br />
To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Steps to perform SFC scan:</strong><br />
1. Click the Start button<br />
2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories<br />
3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option<br />
4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option<br />
5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.<br />
6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter<br />
7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'<br />
8. Be patient because the scan may take some time<br />
9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue<br />
10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"<br />
11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 is taking a long time to load desktop after login</h2>

<p><strong>Hi&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>i am using windows 7 on my HP-530 laptop. My friend installed that and activated that but i think he installed the cracked version. after installation it was doing really perfect. but after some time when i connected to internet, some updates were installed
 and then when i logged into the windows, it prompts me that you are using pirated version or something like that, (i don't remember actually). then i restored back to my previous state and then everything was fine. after that i stopped the automatic updates
 but these days my window startup is having some problems. after entering the password, its taking much time to load the desktop and its keep on showing 'Loading, please wait....'</p>
<p>i am really&nbsp;fed up with that, also i need to restart my laptop by pressing the power button, and after restarting it works fine. But i need someone to answer<strong>why its taking much time in loading the desktop</strong>...??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also please give me some tips to solve this issue, keep this thing in mind that my computer is virus free, and got a good processor and RAM. i installed my windows in C drive, and in my C drive only almost 2GB space is left (almost). and there is no extra
 program running auto in msconfig, other than gtalk, skype etc.</p>
<p>I will be really thankful if someone please give me the solution.</p>

<p>HP would have supplied your Laptop with win preinstalled, they would also have supplied a means of recovering your Laptop to factory specs, either by means of recovery disks or a hidden recovery partition which you had to access in order to make the recovery
 disks. How you access any recovery partition is an HP option, its not an MS process - visit HP site, specific to your model for details of how.</p>
<p>If an illegal version of win7 has been installed, either you need to purchase the version of win7 you require, or you need to recover your Laptop to factory supplied condition, in doing so you will lose everything on the laptop, If you have lost or cannot
 make the restore cd's then phone HP support, they would usually supply disks for a small fee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't much in this article that doesn't send shivers down my spine. Even the promise of stronger RPG elements than were in Mass Effect 2 seem to be tinged with a 'we don't really care about that side of things' tone, though of course that could be
 me misinterpreting his words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I'm really going to have to stop reading information about Mass Effect 3 because the more I find out, the less I'm looking forward to the game and since this is the end of Shepard's trilogy I really want to go in with my hopes set high.</p>

<p>Coming from the Marketing boss, Silverman, I'm not at all surprised by the statements, or quotes therein.<br />
<br />
He's had a habit of saying things in the past regarding not only ME 3 now, but also DA 2 that just make you want to either cringe or punch a baby. Ok maybe not the latter... but it does make you cringe.<br />
<br />
I know people have had this stupid argument on the ME 2 board and even ME 1 board before, but it goes without saying that Mass Effect 1 was and always will be the one game in the trilogy that was as close to a "RPG" as it could get.<br />
<br />
These new features, or "deeper" RPG features in ME 3 are nothing but weapon customization from a static bench predefined and set in the game world from the looks of it. Sure you may select a different scope, sight, attachment, or hey even choose what camo!
 But really, that's not as deep in the "RPG" aspect as some might think.<br />
<br />
The term RPG is of course defined differently by each person so my little rant here can easily fall on deaf ears, to each their own.<br />
<br />
To some the term is simply character progression throughout a non-linear story, interactions made with the world around that character, character development, or at the very least making choices as you "role play" someone.<br />
<br />
To others it does mean the "ugly" stat-based mechanics that most do attribute to the widely defined term of an RPG and out of all 3 games, ME 1 tied that in with just about everything while ME 2 obviously did not and ME 3 doesn't seem to either because streamlining
 is the name of the game now.<br />
<br />
Was it a successful streamlined system? Yes. Optimal in a game sense, in that it worked how it should?&nbsp; Well yes obviously that's why it was successful.&nbsp; However, it doesn't mean everyone liked the change as some, like myself, liked the "stat-based" system
 ME 1 had and sometimes it really just takes a vocal minority like the BSN forums are to change something.&nbsp; Prime example, same *** romance implemented because multiple upon multiple threads demanded it and their wish was granted by BioWare.<br />
<br />
Now people who complained about weapons being terrible from the very start in ME 1 obviously didn't understand that you actually have to level up your respected stats, upgrade to a better weapon, and add certain/better components to the weapon to make it better;
 that's natural progression of any "RPG" if stats have something to do with how good or bad something performs. In Mass Effect 2, each weapon is exactly the same in that you have no choice in how it performs other than faster or slower or having an ammo power
 equipped to it. I found that to be really shallow and far from being the better system of "customization".<br />
<br />
Long story short, while I'm still fully looking forward to Mass Effect 3 as I have not given up hope just yet for it and as I have already pre-ordered the N7 Collectors Edition, these RPG features BioWare keeps touting in live demos really is not as deep as
 they are portraying and is more or less something you would find in your typical action/adventure game when it comes to customization.<br />
<br />
I love customization, <b>don't get me wrong </b>I'm very glad to see they are at least attempting to take a step back to how you fully customized things in ME 1 especially weapons, but from what I've seen so far it's obviously not going to be the same, and
 to me is pretty basic.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion and view on it, other people are different. So have at it, I just wanted to quickly chime in, give a tl;dr post and never visit again. ;)<br />
<br />
(<i>I've actually been fairly dormant from the Mass Effect forums the past couple weeks, and to be honest I kind of like it. Sometimes this place gives me a headache</i>... :P)</p>

<p>Silverman is a douche, but this article has me worried. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;RPG elements seem to be adding scopes and camo's, like we do in CoD</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Vega looks like he was plucked right from marcus Fenix's side.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The constant hype around ME3's gun play</p>
<p>Color me concerned. &nbsp;I hope they can pull it off, but I have a feeling this is the end of Bioware as inventors of cool IP. &nbsp;They seem to be taking the EA money making machine pretty seriously these days. &nbsp;</p>

<p>more action adventure? sounds great. ive never been a fan of &nbsp;rpgs that deliver their depth in over complicated menus and lame stats: i dont play card games and i dont care about dice rolls</p>
<p>the biggest hole in mass effect [1] was the obvious rpg dice rolling goin on just under the surface and i hate every second of it. having a target reticle the size of a plate was always terrible idea</p>
<p>im all for more action, less 'so called' rpg. frankly im sick of tired things that dont involve playing the game. every second i sit in a menu is time better spent completing a mission</p>
<p>almost every improvement in mass effect 2 kept me playing the game and not sorting thru inventory slots. if i wanted to farm loot id play WoW or Tool Human, i play mass effect for story and [now] gameplay</p>
<p>as for vega, watching ppl complain about a character they know absolutely nothing about is just funny. 'oh he looks like a meat head' so what? if bioware writes him better than thane i might let him live</p>

<p>I'm curious Rising, from your general comments it seems like you'd prefer the game to be a pure third person shooter? That after all what makes up the bulk of ME2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me it sounds as if you'd enjoy the Gears of War games more, which have a decent story and far better combat than what either Mass Effect 1 and 2 can offer. Perhaps even Red Dead: Redemption which offers a classic western tale and definitely falls into
 the action-adventure category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if they were personal questions but I do genuinely find it curious that you play role playing games but dislike most of the tropes associated with them.</p>

<p>I think this is a issue of definition&nbsp;over preference. Some people&nbsp; have a broader definition of an &nbsp;rpg than others. Some think if the game doesn't have this, this or that it's not an rpg. One fundamental aspect of rpg's&nbsp; is the branching narrative, you'll
 find this in traditional board games like D&amp;D. And branching narrative is a major part of this trilogy&nbsp; It's all in how you define things. I can see how some consider ME2 an rpg and others don't. I'm not hung up on labels, I enjoy both for what they are, but
 I prefer ME2.</p>

<p>A branching narrative also isn't something that is necessarily part of an RPG either. Some of the favourites I've had over the years have had a very A to B path of progression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'd still say that Mass Effect 2 is a role playing game, if I stretched my personal definition :P However the same case could equally be made for the previously mentioned Red Dead: Redemption, a game that is near identical to Mass Effect 2 in story progression,
 character customisation, mission structure, combat etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact I'd say that RDR is more of a role playing game than Mass Effect 2.</p>

<p>trope, cliche. both have rather negative connotations. either way [imo] both imply that no one has found an innovative way to solve a creative problem and instead use an old, reliable and predictable treatment. boring</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the gears campaign is AAA action movie material [re: cliche] but i play that game for the multiplayer. my favorite perspective will always be third person - over the shoulder; im not an fps guy, doesnt matter what game it is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bioware also thought third person games featuring guns should play like modern third person action games and yea, i think bullets should go where i tell them too. bucking a trend that makes sense might not make money</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost every game benefits from meaningful character progression, branching story lines and multiple endings. theyre all &nbsp;important elements in most games i really enjoy because they add depth and replayability</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the illusion of choice is important because every game has a predefined ending. i just want to feel like i had some input in how the story unfolds. ill farm for plot but if theres no gameplay payoff im not grinding just for loot or xp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ill take a weapons bench with a dynamic gui instead of an inventory screen; menus are not immersive, they take me out of the game and force me to think about the game, not about what im doing in it.</p>

<p>Yet you favour Mass Effect 2 when it seems to try and break immersion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From dropping you at the start of every mission and the end of mission screens, not to mention the planet scanning. Then there are the loading screens everytime you go anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass Effect's inventory had it's flaws but the rest of the game did its very best to keep you in the game universe, the sequel seems to do the exact opposite.</p>

<h2>            &#39;windows couldn&#39;t connect to the windows all user install agent service&#39;. this has created many problems&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a popup saying <strong>'windows couldn't connect to the windows all user install agent service'
</strong>and asked me to see the event log. I did not understand anything but what I understood is that my system became very slow and some apps like Google chrome and other net related apps were not working and the most important thing is that the
<u>windows defender update&nbsp;and normal&nbsp;windows&nbsp;update &nbsp;is not working say that there is a connection failed.
</u>only internet explore 10 is working as which I think is because it is a MS authenticated web browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; and also one more thing&nbsp;when it asked me to look into the event log . I observed that it showed kernel power management error and that&nbsp; one of the processors speed has been reduced by the system firmware .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE! somebody help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</span></p>
<span>
<p><b>Method 1: </b></p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the <b>System maintenance</b> troubleshooter:</p>
<p>a. Press <b>Windows key + W</b> to search Settings.</p>
<p>b. Type “<b>Troubleshoot</b>” without quotes and click on <b>Troubleshooting </b>
in the<b> </b>results displayed on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>c. In the new window, click <b>View all</b> which is towards the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>d. In the list of options, click on <b>System maintenance</b>.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Next</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode. If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, then place the computer in clean boot state and check which third party app/program is causing this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Safe Mode:</strong><br />
<span><font>Follow the steps to boot to safe mode:</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>a.</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>b.</font><span> </span></span></span><span>In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>c.</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Click the ‘Boot’ tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>d.</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Under ‘Boot Options’, select the ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span><span>Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the Safe boot check box:</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>f.</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Select ‘Minimal’ and click OK and then restart your PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Clean Boot:</strong><br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>

 return your computer to Normal startup mode.</font></span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Set Internet Explorer as default web browser and check if the issue persists. </p>

            Hi Mysterious 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Sync your Settings
<br />
<br />Is Theme Syncing turned on, if so, turn that off and see if changes you make to your Start Menu stick after a restart . . .

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try to re-register Start Menu:
<br />
<br />1. Open Task Manager, click File &gt; Run new task.
<br />
<br />2. Type powershell in the Create new task box. Check the option 'Create this task with administrative privileges'. Click OK.
<br />
<br />3. In the administrative Windows PowerShell window, type/paste following and press Enter key:
<br />
<br />Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
<br />
<br />4. Let it complete and then restart your system.

<h2>            Just messed up when setting up a new PC - do I need a clean install&#63; RESET&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p>For a week now, I've been unable to access 95% of the websites where I need to have my ID &amp; password to log-in, thanks to a badly malfunctioning Norton Vault. (Sometimes it works, most times it doesn't. Very hit &amp; miss - lots of users have complained.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a new back-up PC yesterday. To cut a long story short, I have given up on Norton on that PC and will use Defender, Edge &amp; Bing&nbsp;instead. Sad day, but needs must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It came pre-installed with an advert for Norton&nbsp;(rather than&nbsp;a trial version). It got so complicated that when I set up the new PC (after a four hours' WU etc) I entered my User name
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but not a password</span>. I was staggered when it accepted it. But the upshot is that it's imported stuff from this PC including Norton. In addition, although I hadn't yet used my Subscription card to install Office365
 Home&nbsp;2016, it also imported a&nbsp;'slimmer' version of outlook. I'm slowly going bonkers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that I can go back to the stage after the PC&nbsp;had been&nbsp;fully updated i.e. where I enter my Microsoft User ID &amp; password?&nbsp; Do I need a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll then next install Office365 Home 2016 and get going - hopefully. Thank you.</p>

    <title>&#34;A required device is not connected, or cannot...&#34; Solution if - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dakotalally  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;A required device is not connected, or cannot...&#34; Solution if changing PC hardware</h2>
                    <p>I had the error "a required device is not connected, or cannot be accessed" just a bit ago. &nbsp;After frantically using my phone to find a solution, -none of which worked -, I thought about it logically.. I was able to access the operating system in safe mode
 with command prompt. &nbsp;I did this following someone's advice about using bootrec /fixmbr to solve the issue. &nbsp;I thought about it more, and being as safe mode should be compatible with ANY hardware, I realized what was causing this issue, and EXACTLY how to
 fix it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently rearranged my apartment, this took several days, but I still needed to use my computer, so I was using my laptop. &nbsp;Not an issue until I had a head crash (the part of a hard drive that reads data slams into the disk inside and corrupts everything)
 This was a heartbreaking sound! I hope no one has to listen to this as the computer locks up and blue-screens. &nbsp;I popped the solid state drive from my desktop in, and after a long boot (2-3 minutes), it started, and all my hardware was functioning perfectly.
 &nbsp;I finished rearranging, and popped the drive back into my desktop, and was getting this error. &nbsp;I didn't understand why this could happen when the OS was working perfectly less than 2 minutes prior.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fiddling around with other people's suggestions, and them failing to work, I sat back and thought. &nbsp;A laptop has unique hardware, and it probably has some sort of firmware capable of communicating with the OS to get the basic systems working. &nbsp;A desktop
 on the other-hand, is different, you can swap motherboards, processors, RAM, PCI devices, ETC with great ease, and they all come with drivers specific for them. &nbsp;Safe mode can use these devices on their most primitive level, but trying to boot normally, and
 all goes arry. &nbsp;I decided that this error must be the fact that the OS didn't know how to use my WIFI card to download the drivers for my system. &nbsp;I strung a 50 foot ethernet cable across my apartment, and after a 5 minute boot time, everything was good as
 new. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of this, is that if you are changing hardware, or swapping a drive, and you have an issue like this, odds are, it is a driver issue. &nbsp;If the OS doesn't know how to use the hardware, it can't, and it will simply fail to load. &nbsp;Try to connect your
 system with the most legacy devices as possible. &nbsp;This means no bluetooth keyboard, no WIFI, avoid HDMI, no non-stock SD card readers, get the system on USB keyboard(or preferably PS/2), Ethernet, VGA, and USB ports built into the motherboard. &nbsp;These systems
 should get your computer to access the internet, with you being able to control the options via keyboard, and it will download the drivers needed to run the system as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A computer can be smart, it can do phenomenal things, but it can't do what it isn't taught to do. &nbsp;You have to enable it to use what it was already taught, to teach it to do what you need. &nbsp;This is the basic premise of programs and applications. &nbsp;The computer
 can run the latest games and render the latest graphics, but it needs to be taught how, with a program - drivers are programs that allow it to use the hardware that is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps some people. &nbsp;Keep in mind, this is only relavent if you have changed hardware, and usually if it is a big change, adding a HDD or some RAM probably isn't relevant, Replacing a motherboard, a CPU, or a graphics card
 is what can cause this.</p>
