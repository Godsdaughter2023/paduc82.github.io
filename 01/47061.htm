<h2>            Why does my BO2 download stop at 80&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. When I bought my Xbox 360, it came with 2 games: CoD Ghosts and CoD BO2 (digital). I've been trying to download BO2 for ages, but I can't. The download always stops at 79% or 80%. It's very annoying and I don't know what to do. I already tried to delete the incomplete game file and clearing the cache and stuff, but it still doesn't work, what can I do? By the way, sorry for my bad english, my main language is spanish so I often commit mistakes :P</p><p><br /></p><p>Edit: idk if this is the right section to post this, so sorry. If it has to be somewhere else, move it<br /></p>

    <title>Windows Store fo Business LOB apps wont work offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gorancob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store fo Business  LOB apps wont work offline</h2>
                    <p>About a year ago Windows had issues with apps crashing and wont open when the device is offline. The online community was buzzing with fixes like fresh/clean install, DISM, SFC and what not... but none were helping as it was really windows (windows store)
 issue with licencing the apps. For some people like myself switching to local account helped to resolve and get the apps working. That was then - long time ago and since then the issue has disappeared, or at least seems to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am back to the same boat with same issues but now with Windows Store for Business Apps (private LOB apps). Those behave exactly the same now when the device is offline. The Windows Application event logs the error pointing out to Windows-TwinUI/Operational
 log which further reveals the error Application {appPackagename} failed to activate. Windows.Launch failed with No licence found for the app. Funny enough the same log show also successful activation if the device is switched online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone experiencing same issues with LOB apps (or try it with your own LOB apps if you have them to confirm this behaviour) ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suspicion is that the app was downloaded and activated as LOB from private store with account that is linked to Office 365 Business. Tried storing/saving the account to windows which provisions the device with the company/business successfully and the
 private store shows up nicely as it is supposed to in Windows Store app. As the matter of fact that is the only way to access and download apps from private/business store. I've also tried with provisioning and not saving the account for business store -which
 also gives me access to the private store. Both methods yield same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried all old tricks, even fresh install (Reset Win10 with delete everything) - the app still behaves exactly same - crashes without ability to activate when offline - but works perfectly fine when online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devices are not joined to domain or linked to Azure AD in any way. That beats the purpose of the app which is for the service technicians that are on the road and offline disconnected most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help on this to spur a discusstion that will poke Microsoft to do something about this. Posting errors and giving feedback to Microosft is dead end when LOBs are in question as all feedback goes to the developer even though the issue has nothing
 to do with the developer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to ditch Windows and create Android or iOS version for this app. I was really waiting for a long time for Windows to come with those Enterprise/Business level restrictions to publish my apps (as you can imagine LOB apps have no place and should not
 have a place in public store) because of the availability of lower end hardware&nbsp;for Windows on cheap to run simple business apps like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;However if the basic functionality is missing - app can't even be open I'm nothing but forced to finally quit on Windows.&nbsp;
 Microsoft you are really pushing developers out with issues like this - instead of bringing/attracting them to Windows eco-system.&nbsp; Bridges to bring the apps to windows store are worthless if the apps can't even function online.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to solve those very basic issues if they really want to pull the enterprise into business store. So please put your comments to work and&nbsp;hopefully we can&nbsp;raise&nbsp;enough&nbsp;awareness for Microsoft to do something about this. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            <p>Hi FuSpam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the minidump files you have an Asus K56CA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the minidump files point to the iaStorA.sys which is the Intel storage driver I would suggest to uninstall ExpressCache which has been known to contribute to&nbsp;similar blue screen errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then install the latest <span>Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver available for Windows 8 64-bit from the available link (<span>2013.01.30</span>&nbsp;
<span>update</span>):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;m=K56CA&amp;hashedid=OqQh6qt7m74pvq8E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;m=K56CA&amp;hashedid=OqQh6qt7m74pvq8E</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As ExpressCache is not necessary software you can&nbsp;leave it uninstalled or, if you wish, you could try reinstalling it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If problems persist consider starting a new topic on the issue to get better help and to avoid confusion with the original poster's topic.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Access is Denied&#34; despite installed encryption key and added permissions</h2>
                    <p>I moved encrypted files to a secondary hard drive and backed up the encryption certificates before wiping my OS drive. Now, on a fresh install of Windows 10, I've installed the encryption certificates and added permissions of Full Control for Everyone on
 the files themselves (which are still residing on the secondary hard drive). </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to open the files or clear the encryption checkbox, I get "Access is Denied." What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any help; I really don't want to lose access to this data!</p>

            I've added the permissions following the instructions you've provided and I still have the same issue.
<br />
<br />
When I attempt to clear the "encrypt contents to secure data" checkbox (under properties, advanced) I get "An error occurred applying attributes to the file:<br />

<br />
When I attempt to open the file, I get: "There was an error opening this document. Access is denied."<br />

Not sure where this is going wrong.<br />

Thanks for your help so far; very eager for next steps on how to fix this.

            Hi LenRomeo
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You would need to uninstall (if printer is already installed) and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Make sure all of your Chipset Drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, find the make and model of your motherboard. Then go to the motherboards maufacturers website and go to Support and then Drivers.</p>
<p>Then from there you should be able to select the model of your motherboard from a list and download the Chipset drivers.</p>

<p>Hoped that helped</p>

<p>Updated chipset drivers ( which used a ATI installer for some reason) and it didn't help . I ran a memtest for 30 hours and i had 58 passes and 0 errors so im guessing its not the memorie's fault. Also i have had a couple of new types of BSODs :&nbsp;</p>

<li>What is the motherboard manufacturer company? </li><li>What is the exact model number of that motherboard? </li><li>Your motherboard CD does not comes with any USB driver? It's strange but some AMD board came with additional drivers rather than the OS.
</li><li>How long you are using this board? </li><li>Is there any constant USB devices(like printers, webcam) are connected with your machine? Then remove those for experimental basis &amp; investigate for few days if BSOD rate decreases or not. By this process sort out the defective USB hardware.
</li></ol>
<p>Confirm us about if you get USB related BSOD working with a particular port or all the ports?</p>
<p>Can you use your USB port with some USB devices? Provide the list of the devices you have used with your machine.</p>
<p>As halmacpi.dll &amp; USBPORT.SYS both get errors so the devices connected via USB may be responsible for such crash.</p>

<p>1. manufacturer ASUSTeK Computer INC</p>
<p>2. model number M4A785TD-V EVO</p>
<p>3. I cannot find any usb drivers on my motherboard CD</p>
<p>4.The board is new i have been using it for two weeks and the BSODs started on the first day i installed windows</p>
<p>5. The USB devices attached to the computer are hp deskjet 5652 and a 8700 one touch usb scanner and i have been using both of them on my old computer with no problems( also they were turned off every time there was a BSOD), also the mouse ofc is usb but
 i also have ausb cable modem&nbsp; Scientific Atlanta Webstar 2000 series witch is turned on at all times but i have also been using it on my previous computer with no problems. Also i just installed a gamepad and there was a BSOD after but i dont think it is because
 of the gamepad since the error is more or less the same as before it</p>

<p>Looking at the minidump files with WinDbg of the Debugging Tools for Windows, shows that the driver most likely causing the crash is the sacmxp2.sys. The&nbsp; sacmxp2.sys is a driver for the Webstar 2000 modem.</p>
<p>The date on the sacmxp2.sys is Apr. 10. 2003 so this driver may be able to be updated. However as there does not appear to be a&nbsp;Windows 7 specific driver for the modem it may have to be replaced.</p>
<p>The sptd.sys (installed with such programs as Daemon Tools)&nbsp;is also referenced in some of the crashes so it may also help to update this driver:</p>

<p>Hmm this sounds interesting since the modem is so far my #1 suspect, i actually downloaded some drivers for it dated from 2006 and with them i couldnt even connect. I am now back at some 6.10.2004 drivers which i found recently but wanted to try the newer
 ones first. I am going to try and get a newer modem and try it out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the biggest problem so far has resurfaced: 3-4 times so far when i turned on my computer windows basically went berserk right from the start. The loading cursor spins around like crazy and when i go into the task manager the CPU performance
 just keeps jumping constantly changing percentages all the time. I actually tried restarting it in safe mode and it was the same in there. I turn the computer off and a couple of hours later when i turned it back on it started normally. I hope this is connected
 to my original problem but if it's not I have no idea how to find out why it's happening.</p>

<p>Got the new modem today, this time it is connected with a LAN cable instead of an USB .</p>
<p>So far no blue screens but I turned on the computer right after I connected the modem and it was in berserk mode again.</p>
<p>I checked the processes and they aren't consuming much of the CPU, the max CPU usage was 11% maybe i saw 17% for a microsecond.</p>
<p>The active processes mostly stay at 0% then every couple of seconds jump to a different percent then back to 0% or to another percentage and this just keeps going on and on really fast. The processes were: dwm.exe 0%-1% ; fourengine.exe 0%-2% ; sidebar.exe
 0%-6%-9%-11% and maybe others this is just what i managed to see it just changes too fast; and taskmgr.exe 0%-3%-4%-5%-6%.</p>
<p>At the time the computer couldn't recognize the new modem so i didnt have an internet connection and when i entered firefox it said not responding then normal then not responding again and so on but it stopped when i guess it realized there was no connection
 .</p>
<p>I also went into chess titans just to see if it would work and it did but it was going too fast, the pieces just teleported to the new places.</p>
<p>This is a real problem and it's not like a regular blue screen so i dont know how to get information about it.</p>
<p>If i turn of the computer and turn it back on like a half hour later it's still the same but it usually goes back to normal if i keep it turned of for a couple of hours and then turn it back on.</p>
<p>( The memory usage seems normal it stays around 660 MB and i have 2GB of max RAM )</p>

<br />
When you "upgraded" and then "downgraded" - did you install the hardware device drivers manually from the hardware manufacturer?&nbsp; You need to obtain and install the latest video card driver for your video card from the manufacturer by figuring out what the
 video card is (likely made by Intel, ATI/AMD or nVidia) and getting the driver from the manufacturers web page for the model of that card manually for the operating system you have ended up with.&nbsp; Ignore any drivers folders, built in Windows tools, etc.&nbsp; You
 get it manually.

<p><br />
As I said...</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
You need to obtain and install the latest video card driver for your video card from the manufacturer by figuring out what the video card is (likely made by Intel, ATI/AMD or nVidia) and getting the driver from the manufacturers web page for the model of that
 card manually for the operating system you have ended up with.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
So you figure out who the manufacturer is of the video card in your system and what model of video card you have and you visit the appropriate manufacturer's web page and obtain the driver for that video card from their drivers and downloads area - saving it
 to your machine - and you run it to install it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
How you figure out what video card you have will vary - but a receipt/invoice might help, device manager might help, opening the computer *if desktop) might help, something like Belarc Advisor might help, etc.&nbsp; You may even be able to visit a manufacturer web
 page for the entire computer and key in a serial number for it and get a driver that way.</p>

<br />
ll need to do the same with your network drivers - those will be as important (if not more important) than your video drivers.&nbsp; You'll need to figure out what the network device is as well and download those drivers.&nbsp; You'll probably have to download them on
 whatevber computer you are on posting these messages, put them on a removable media (CD, DVD, USB thumb drive, etc.) and get them to the other machine that way.&nbsp; Once you get the network drivers working - you'll probably be able to get on the Internet to get
 the rest on the machine itself.<br />

What is the make and model of the system as a whole?

    <title>Paddle mechanism inside Elite controller has worn out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fxuls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paddle mechanism inside Elite controller has worn out</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using the Elite controller for a little over a year now and I have loved it. I got it because I play Overwatch very competitively and having the paddles lets me cut out the time it takes to move my fingers from the trigger to the bumpers or off
 the sticks at all. After I got used to the new set up it really made a difference and was worth the $150 I paid for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However a few months ago my bottom right paddle started to not feel right. It would sometimes not register when I clicked it but it happened so rarely I didn't really do anything about it. Then it slowly stopped clicking all together. When I press any of
 the other three paddles you can feel it click but it became so that the bottom left would just sort of rub against the back of the controller instead of clicking. Over the months the frequency at which I would press it and it wouldn't register slowly increased.
 I watched a bunch of Youtube videos trying to troubleshoot it and get it working again but couldn't make any progress or even really find someone with the same problem as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up contacting Microsoft directly looking for help before it got any worse but they weren't any help. They weren't able to tell me how I could fix it myself so I asked if it was a defect but they told me it didn't matter because it was out of the
 90 day warranty. I asked them about getting it serviced and they actually told me they wouldn't fix it even if I was paying money for them to fix one paddle. I straight up asked them what I should do and the lady told me to go buy a new controller. That kinda
 made me see I wasn't getting anywhere so I just said ok thanks and ended the chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been 2 months since that and it's gotten to the point where the paddle doesn't register more often than it does. I take the paddle out and put it back in every few hours but I don't think it is making that much of a difference. If it doesn't register
 when I press it during a competitive match I have to press and hold down really hard to get it to register and in a game as fast-paced as Overwatch by that time I'm typically dead. It has been incredibly frustrating and has gotten to the point to make me make
 an account and write this post. When I bought the Elite controller I thought it was the best of the best and the highest quality controller available, but now I don't really think that such a great controller would wear out in a year to the point where I have
 to go spend $150 on a new one that I don't even know will last past the 90 days covered in the warranty.&nbsp;</p>

            Depending on the region you are in depends on the warranty you have from the place of purchase, with the UK, its usually around 2 years.&nbsp; The best thing to do is to contact the Place of Purchase and see what options are available to you.&nbsp; Most stores will
 do this for you as well, do be turned away from them stating to contact the manufacturer.&nbsp; Just make sure you have all the components and the original receipt.&nbsp; And explain to them about the 2 years warranty if in the UK, and ask them to follow up for you.

<p><span>On searching about the compatibility the device with Windows 7 I found out that the device compatible with Windows 7 but some
 reason windows is not automatically loading the drivers for it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would suggest that depending on the model number of the card use the below link download and install the drivers for Windows
 for the device and check.</span></p>

<br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br />You're simply clearing and resetting the thumbnail cache which at times may be corrupted causing thumbnails not being properly displayed.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Of course, you can. It is just cache of thumbnails not actual thumbnails. If thumbnails not displaying, usually we recommend to delete this thumbnail cache.
<br />

            Hi Marcia
<br />
<br />The correct way to run disk cleanup is explained below, you need to run it twice and yes, delete everything suggested by Disk Cleanup:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete

The only thing you need to worry about with the disc version is having at least 5 hours of playtime in the past 12 months or a DLC purchase to be eligible. At the moment, however, they are experiencing issues with the update prompting qualified users to purchase the new version. Give it some time, and you will eventually be able to grab the new version for free.</p>

<h2>            App crashes on one specific account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have downloaded an app and it crashes every time I open it. So I created a new account and guess what, it works just fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like there's something called corrupted account with Microsoft lately. And I don't want to create a new account every time issue happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone here has the same experience like I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any workaround with this corrupted account issue? Migrating not just data but also SETTINGS is a pain each time and in-place upgrade is not a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

            Hi  Sagittarius2711
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Option 1: Reconfigure the Windows Store.
<br />
<br />1. Download and run the problem solver for applications and the Windows Store: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a>
<br />
<br />2. Manually restore store settings:
<br />
<br />a) Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run window.
<br />
<br />b) Type wsreset.exe and press the Enter key to execute the command.
<br />
<br />3. Wait for the process to finish, restart your computer and check that it has been fixed.
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall the app
<br />
<br />Delete all files in 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\User_name\AppData\Local\Packages \Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache
<br />
<br />Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Try installing again.
<br />
<br />Also, make sure you are running the latest Windows 10 Feature Update:
<br />
<br />Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a><br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08925a81-e5e6-41f6-988a-662283a48611?upload=true" />

            Hey Sagi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, I see corrupted accounts many times per day here for years, after seeing almost none during the whole run of WIndows 7 in forums.  
<br />
<br />The solution as you found is to create a new Admin Local Account  in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People, sign into it, move your files over, test all programs run correctly:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Then when ready you can delete the old in the same place as above, and convert the new account to your MS account if desired:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a> 
<br />
<br />As to what you can do, I haven't seen a lot of repeats so it may be enough for now.  But be aware that What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />So while a corrupted account only requires changing it out for a new one, for repeated corrupted accounts I would try the Clean install simply because it solves all otoher problems if you stick with only the steps, tools and methods given in the above install used by millions in Windows 7 and 10 for ten years without a single complaint.
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a look at fresh start, this is new to me. So I went searching for the difference between fresh start and reset the PC. However, there's no clear information about this. As you are an expert, could you share something about it with me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I cannot verify if it works at the moment since I have created a new account to solve the issue with the app. And as you may know, clean installation and migrating account are my least favorite. Thus I want to reach out and see if there's any
 other way around it. Or like tool, even not from Microsoft to help clean installation (without USB) or migrate data and settings from one account to another. Or just simply something else...that I cannot come up with now lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you very much for your detailed answer :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good day to you</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Some PC maker's customize the Reset to include their factory bloatware so it is a full factory restore.  Fresh Start assures all factory bloatware will be left out and only Windows will be reinstalled (along with it's own apps, of course).  So that's the difference.

            If you have another computer connected via wifi to the same wireless router, you can click on the wireless icon in the taskbar (lower right) on that computer, then right click on the name of the connection (the one that shows "Connected") and click on
 Properties and then on the Security tab it will show the "Network Security Key" -- click "Show characters" below that.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another way to get to the Network Properties dialog is Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center and then click on the Wireless Network Connection listed beside Connections (again assuming the computer is connected via wifi)
 and then click on Wireless Properties and then on the Security tab it will show the "Network Security Key" -- click "Show characters" below that.<br />
<br />
If you no longer have any computers that will connect via wifi with the router, you will have to go to the router settings and get the key there.<br />

    <title>Can SCCM remove print drivers from a deployed PC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squeezeframe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can SCCM remove print drivers from a deployed PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I may be in the wrong community.&nbsp; If so, please point me in the correct direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have roughly 400 printers installed on Server 2012 R2.&nbsp; We are implementing a new Windows print solution due to our 2008 R2 cluster's erratic behavior.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We created a one node development box that is in place for now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When we switched from the cluster to a stand alone solution, we had about 150 drivers that became corrupted and would not print until we performed a number of steps to remove the "broken" driver package and replace the driver of the same&nbsp;type&nbsp;from our driver
 store by hand. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select affected printer, go to local driver store to note location of the print driver files</p>
<p>2, Delete existing printer</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Stop spooler</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Delete driver files</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Restart print spooler</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Run&nbsp;GPUPDATE /FORCE to reapply the printer with a working driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we go live with our new solution we would like to remove the driver and package using SCCM if possible hoping to avoid the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our current deployment method is using Security Groups (memberships) and separate GPOs to push the assigned printer to the proper Windows 7 32 bit OS PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below: 
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749</a>... 
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again. 
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers and look for updates first 
<br />
<br />Also, I attach some link with more procedures in case the steps above didn't work:

<h2>            service host high cpu usage</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I updated to the latest windows 10 version and ever since then my cpu is running at like 70% on idle, when it use to be like 3 or 4%.</p>
<p>My fan is running non stop and the laptop is hot. When I open task manager I can see 2 service hosts running in between 20 to 30%, I've included a screenshot. When I try to end the task, the laptop just restarts itself because of an error.</p>
<p>I never had this problem since the last update. I don't know how to fix or stop it. It's a real concern because my laptop is running slower and hotter than it should.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions or can help fix it, it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e47622ce-66db-4dcd-abd9-e85821a1ed4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e47622ce-66db-4dcd-abd9-e85821a1ed4c" /></a></p>
