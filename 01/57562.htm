<h2>            Greyed out name fields - Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t start support chat</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to get help, but the required name fields to start a support chat are greyed out. I'm trying to figure out why my Xbox Live Gold subscription (trial) is active in my account, but Xbox One games don't recognize it. We just setup our Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thx!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Does Not Display Calendar Invites Correctly</h2>
                    I sent an airline reservation to my Gmail account with the intention of adding the itinerary to my calendar. Signing into Gmail via the web, it is clear that the message is an invite (calendar icon next to the message). My Android cell phone mail app also
 shows a dot ics attachment allowing &nbsp;save to the calendar. However, the Microsoft mail app simply displays a blank message. This is a bug.

            When I receive a calendar invitation and they have attached a file with the dial in numbers or the presentation we are going to discuss, it is not attached to my calendar invitation, or I do not know how to open these or find them. &nbsp;There is a small picture

<h2>            xbox wont connect anymore</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>so i have had this xbox for just shy of a year now, since day one i have been connected to xbox live gold.</p>
<p>recently have been having trouble connecting - as soon as i sign in it tries to log on for a split second then says theres a problem</p>
<p>when i run configuration it just tells me to disconnect the router and rejoin it, which i have done numerous times.</p>
<p>its really frustrating as there is two laptops, one pc a wii and two xbox's in the house all connect without problems except my bloody xbox which just wont have any of it. friends are saying it might be my xbox has damaged itself or something as the other
 xbox in the house connects without a hitch everytime.</p>
<p>should i be looking to get the xbox sent back for repairs or is there something i should do before i do this? i have sky broadband and liked i said, everything else connects just fine, they dont know why my xbox wont connect up.</p>

<p>Hey there Almond! I understand you are having issues signing in to your console. Just for comparison, do other profiles have the same issues when trying to connect on your console, and do you have issues when trying to connect on another console? Also, have
 you tried downloading your profile again since this happened? Give that a go on your console and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
Also, you mention many other devices on your same network. Are all or some of these devices being used at the same time? If your router supports it, try enabling UPnP and see if that clears it up. If not, or if it causes problems for any other devices, go ahead
 and turn it back off. Let me know what you find out, thanks!</p>

<blockquote>I want to set up contact groups with several email addresses in, but would like to hide the email addresses from the recipients but don't know how to do it. I am using Windows Vista and windows mail...</blockquote>
<br />
<strong>To hide e-mail addresses from the recipients</strong> :<br />
Enter the recipients' addresses in BCC. When you click Create Mail, you have TO and CC. Do you also have BCC underneath ?<br />
If not, click View &gt; click All Headers. Now you have Bcc.<br />
Bcc = blind carbon copy.<br />
<br />
<strong>To set up contact group</strong> :<br />
Open Windows Mail &gt; too bar, click CONTACTS &gt; do you see <strong>New Contact Group</strong> in the tool bar ? If yes, click it. You can go ahead and create group. If you have problem with that, post back.<br />
<br />
If you do not see New Contact Group :<br />
Window Mail &gt; click Contacts &gt;<strong>right</strong> click on an open space inside the right hand side of the window, click
<strong>Customize this folder</strong> &gt;under <strong>What do you want on this folder</strong>, click the pointer till you see<strong> Contacts</strong>. Click it. &gt; click OK<br />

<p>Download and install the <strong>Microsoft Visual C+++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)</strong></p>

            If the idea from XP ROCKS! doesn't work out:<br />
<br />
I thought I had that in me notes, but don't (Arrrrgggh - it <i>is</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>).<br />
<br />
Searching my system I have that file on my system in folders related my currently nonfunctioning AMD/ATI video card and or their Catalyst Control Center (CCC).<br />
<br />
If you accepted any hardware driver updates from MS on Patch Tuesday (never a good idea), maybe you picked up an old video driver from MS.<br />
<br />
If that sounds like it might be you, hop out to the AMD/ATI site and let their scanner (a small download) take a look at your system and if it suggests any video driver updates, consider them:<br />
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Perhaps if we knew your system make and model, etc. we can look there.<br />
<br />
Do this:<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even the new MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If the system boots, Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<h2>            windows update lead to solidworks crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe how windows 10 new update has ruined my life over night. My windows updated automatically to newer version earlier and for about 2 months while I was out of station I didn't use my software solidworks, but now when I got a project in my company
 to do, I started using it, it is crashing again and again. i read so many blogs about the problem and they all blamed the window update. But the problem is I can't even go back to previous version of windows, because when i try to this, it says " we ran into
 a problem and won't be able to take back to your previous version of windows."</p>
<p>I tried&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalling Solidworks.</li><li>Resetting the windows.</li><li>Changing compatibility of Solidworks.</li><li>Tried to go back to previous version but failed.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has some solution to this problem, please help me, your help can save me from losing the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not happy with windows at all.</strong></p>

<p>My son uses SolidWorks on Windows 10. His computer is completely up to date and neither SolidWorks nor his computer have crashed. So you can't blame updates in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People blame updates for all their troubles because it's much easier to blame big, bad Microsoft for everything than it is to understand why their problem happened and possibly take responsibility for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be sure, big bad Microsoft causes lots of problems, but you can't automatically assume that. Here is
<a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/resources.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SolidWorks technical support</a>, which is your first stop for diagnosing problems with SolidWorks. Among their many resources is the SolidWorks Community, where you'll be able to contact people who&nbsp;<em>really</em> know SolidWorks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son is 16 years old and he uses SolidWorks to CAD parts for his robotics team! Not many 16-year olds are doing that.</p>

    <title>Hide &#34;Address box&#34; &#38; &#34;Search Box&#34; in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hide &#34;Address box&#34; &#38; &#34;Search Box&#34; in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to hide, remove, or disable the address box and/or the search box found at the top of File Explorer?&nbsp; I don't use or need to know either of them &amp; am use to them not being there, I rarely search anyways since I am so organized I know
 where everything is.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
I don't want to hide the address bar with "Internet Explorer (Edge)"&nbsp; since I do sometimes type URL's manually for security reasons.<br />
<br />
I have been reading various pages about this issue but still have not found reasonable way to do it...&nbsp; I absolutely DO NOT want to install any 3rd party software or add-on's like tool-bars for example, I just want to hide it preferably without disabling the
 search feature globally..<br />
<br />
I see others who asked this question were suggested to set a hide value within the registry but in many cases they reported it did not work, I avoid modifying the registry unless i am confident, as a programmer I've know all to well things can go south quick
 with only a simply typo in the registry.<br />
<br />
With that said I am hoping that the option to hide these features is buried in one of the snap-ins somewhere, this one of the reasons I elected to get the Professional version is because of the snap-ins, which is more-less a safe method of modifying it with
 known valid values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really seems Windows 10 has some of my most used options missing, and quite honestly its frustrating, like the ability to adjust the font size or remove the accessibility icon on the lock screen, or disable "auto-play" on webpages... In my case I have
 a subscription to Sirius Streaming &amp; listen to music often in the background so that is exceptionally annoying to be interrupted by audio/video playing automatically, I cant even count how many times I have been woke-up by this, my daughter or girlfriend is
 innocently browsing next thing i'm blasted awake! sadly I gave up on trying to disable the auto-play option a few weeks ago!</p>
<p><br />
Anyways now that I got that out can anyone please suggest a solid way to hide to address bar and the search bar in file explorer? I would appreciate it very much if someone could let me know if they successfully managed to do it...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Many Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from modifying the registry, there is currently no other way to hide the address bar within File Explorer. To do so would require changing lines of code within the Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I think hiding it would make the design more aesthetic and tidy. If you want, you can send a feedback about this to our engineers so they can include it in a future update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are instructions for doing that: <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/windows-10-creators-update-and-the-feedback-hub/3497864b-6d55-45bd-834c-4be5edef08a1">Using

<p>There are multiple values and keys that would need to be modified. Even then, the risk of corrupting the system is still highly probably. We highly advise against such modifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to pursue this, however, please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a restore point</a></strong> just to make sure we're safe.
 Once done, head over to <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Technet</a></strong> and ask which values and keys need to be modified. The experts there should have the answer to your question.</p>

<p>So there are multiple threads for this issue now, dating all the way back tell October 1st and there is still no solution. I hate to seem rude or anything, but I have literally tried every option that has even been mentioned and still nothing works. To say
 that it is frustrating is an understatement. I'm still waiting patiently but it is now November 13th and I have yet to receive any type of solution from Xbox Support. I asked the twitter gang, I've posted here. It seems like such a small thing that I guess
 I just don't understand why it hasn't been fixed already. I'm sorry I keep posting in all these threads but I see no other way to get this fixed. Plus we pay for Xbox live, for reasons such as having great support to turn to, and the great content to experience.
 Every day that I have to continue to deal with this is a sad, and frustrating day. Please help us guys.</p>

            Does your machine meet the system requirements, ie - a DX10 or 11 capable graphics card ?<br />
<br />
I'm not quite clear on what is happening regarding DX, but have you updated <br />
Direct X using the Web Installer below before trying to install BF4 ? -<br />

    <title>How do I give different colours to events in windows 10 calandar like - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chosen one 41  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I give different colours to events in windows 10 calandar like was available in previous versions&#63;</h2>
                    In previous versions of windows calendar if I wanted to organize my calendar events I would hit the so-called "calendar" button (keyboard shortcut was Ctrl+Shift+D) and then it would allow me to create a sub-category for my events that would have a specific
 colour associated with it. Now it seems that we just simply have the option to give one colour to all the events which is entirely useless to me. Is there still an option to create colour coded subcategories or what?

            this is insane. the colours are for highlighting. you arel iterally highlighting an event. if it highlights everything in your calander then the highlight is no longer functioning. there is absolutely zero point to highlighting everything. completely insane.
 they have thousands of employees, I find it hard to believe that nobody thought to point out how ridiculous it is to make it this way. its maddening that in this day and age its just more useful to have a paper calander and a set of nice colourful highlighter
 pens. so many thing sin win ten lead me to think microsfot is an equal opportunity employers. not giving out to you but the bloody page wont let me reply to the person below. arrgh! lol.

            You have to buy the premium edition in order to get different colors, otherwise, you just get one color for all events - green.

            I'm not using the calendar app in Windows 10 for this reason. How is this option not available? Differentiating between different events using different colors seems an essential part of the interface...?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also download <strong>Malwarebytes</strong> and run it once a week to check for spyware.</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker crashed - no recovery key - how to recover&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks - I can't seem to find anyone else posting this scenario: I was encrypting a 64GB USB flash drive and Bitlocker crashed when laptop went into sleep mode.&nbsp; Now, when I&nbsp;attach the drive, I get the Bitlocker Drive Encryption window to pop up, with
 the words " Recovery Error" and "Error recovering Disk F: A recovery key was not found on this drive.&nbsp; The drive cannot be unlocked".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not concerned about data (was a new drive), but only want to recover the drive.&nbsp; Windows 7 won't let me format the drive through Explorer, Diskpart won't delete the partition, nor will it clean it.&nbsp; I get errors that say the media is write protected.&nbsp;
 I even tried Eraser, but that gave an error as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about recovering, or deleting and reformatting this drive?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Printer Canon MF8330Cdn - app crashes when print</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the problem with my network printer Canon i-Sensys MF8330Cdn and some apps in Windows 8 Pro (x64). Anytime when I want to print something in Notepad, Wordpad or Offce 2013 (x64) the application crashes. In eventlog there is the message (eg for notepad):
 "Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.2.9200.16384, time stamp: 0x5010acd2 Exception code: 0xc0000005".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Dump file for notepad contains:</div>

</div>
<div>------------------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I print from Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader or test page in printer properties, it works fine. I have 2 computers with clean installation of WIndows8 Pro (x64), Office 2013 (x64) and the problem is the same on both. The printer is officially supported
 for Windows 8. The Canon support answered, that this is the problem of Microsoft's product. :/</div>

            Hi Scott,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>try to download drivers for the printer MF9280 which has newer version of build (v20.85)<span>. This drivers must be installed manually from the control panel. Do not use canon setup file.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Please folow these steps:&nbsp;</span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti-lVcG52dU</div>
<div><br />
<div>After it's done, go back to printer properties, advanced tab and select right drivers for your printer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With&nbsp;MF9280&nbsp;drivers the printer will not work, but in my case old drivers for canon have begun working.&nbsp;It seems that some component of old drivers was replaced with newer version during setup.</div>
<div><br />

            Aaaah - this is wonderful. Thank you so much. I saw on another thread that you (or somebody) got it to work with a different set of Canon drivers, but I didn't pick up on the notion of not using the Canon install program. I just did this by installing
 the driver by hand and now voila all is well. I can print actually from both the 9280 driver and now the 8300 driver, which i've set as default. Thank you very much for replying to the thread and helping me out. I will pass the word along to others who have
 had similar problems that I've encountered in my searches.<br />
Hooray!<br />
Again, thank you,<br />
Scott<br />

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

<p>
</p><p>I would just like to know why we aren't able to install Google Chrome from Edge. I personally prefer Google Chrome over Microsoft Edge because it is an easier search engine to use and we have become so accustomed to using chrome.</p>

<h2>            American Xbox 360 slim works in Europe&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I moved to Spain recently and was considering bringing my American xbox 360 slim instead of buying a new one here for a whopping 300€ ($400). I was doing research regarding this topic but the posts are from a few years ago and I wanted to confirm what I
 found still applies:</p>
<p>-The American Xbox will work in Spain as long as I buy the European power block and I buy the games from the US.</p>
<p>-DLC will not work.</p>
<p>Can anyone please confirm the above?</p>
<p>Also, I had additional additional questions:</p>
<p>-I´m looking to order GTA V, FIFA 14 and NBA 2k14 from the US. Will the updates to these games apply to my american xbox here in Europe or will I be forced to play them in the default state?</p>
<p>-Will I be able play with my friends from the US on xbox live from here?</p>

<p>Thanks everyone, any advice would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Are the power bricks dual voltage? if so you just need a 110 to 220 plug adapter. If not yes you will need a different power brick.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>No idea on DLC</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Yes you can play with your friends. I have played with people from all over.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Maybe go on the support forums and ask some of these questions.</p>

<p>Yes your US console should work fine, as long as you have the right power plug adapter and proper connector for a Pal television, be sure to change your NTSC settings to PAL on your xbox. You should be able to still access your us account as well, the only
 issue might be restrictions and blocks on certain US DLC, games on demand and apps. Europe region DVD movies probably won't work as the region code is completely different to USA region 1. I have a UK xbox and Australian region 4 DVD movies won't work whatsoever,
 I only use it play games. But funny enough Aussie games work on it. If it is any help you can change your account region to Europe Spain in account settings on this website.</p>

 free game&nbsp;should also be region free.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So, if the game you want is region free, you won't have to import a U.S version. The PAL version will work just fine.&nbsp; You will need to do some investigating per game though.<br />
<br />
</span>Can anyone please confirm the above?<br />
 you download from.&nbsp; Some content will not download if you remain in the U.S region.&nbsp; You may be able to buy, but the content will not always download if your account&nbsp;does not match your physical location.&nbsp; This issue can crop up if said content has any regional
 lock-outs, like I mentioned earlier.<br />

<p>Thank you so much for the detailed response Obsessive Power. I called XBOX support here in Spain and your response was definitely more helpful!</p>
<p>I plan to remain in Spain but with Xbox One coming out soon I don´t want to buy a new console to be honest.</p>
<p>I just had one question about the games:</p>
<p>Games like FIFA 14 and NBA 2K14 are region-locked. To play on my American xbox here in Europe would I need to buy the European version fo the game (PAL) or the US version (NSTC)?</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t the VPN work on windows 10 mobile&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me why on earth doesn't the VPN work on windows 10 mobile??? L2TP refuses to connect with Error 628. PPTP and IKEv2 does connect but the traffic is not being sent through it, like the connection is made for nothing. all traffic is sent pass
 the VPN connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I have tried the same VPN account and servers on other devices such as Windows PC, macbook and iPAD and on all of them work on L2TP,PPTP and IKEV2 without any issues.</p>
<p>My phone is a lumia 950 running Production Build .420, fresh installed,no backups, right after a WDRT install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, on the same conditions, meaning at home on the same network, all other devices work on all 3 VPN types. My phone does not as I have explained above.</p>

            <p>thanks for the intention of helping but seems that it's a problem in win10mo. Traffic is not directed through VPN when it works. L2TP 90% does not work. I wonder what is the use of the VPN if data traffic is going pass it anyway??</p>
<p>I am truly disappointed that Ms took such a dumb choice. this phone should be business ready...how can it be without a working VPN feature??</p>

            I'm having the same problem with my Lumia 950 xl. I thought there was something wrong with the phone as i am about to return it. So the problem is with the operating system. Why does not MS fix it????????????????????????

            <p>I know this thread is a bit old, but I wanted to share my findings regarding windows 10 mobile and default gateway / split tunneling (i.e., not sending&nbsp;traffic through the VPN when connected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our case. the correct protocol to choose when setting up any VPN manually through the Windows 10 Mobile interface is "Automatic."&nbsp;That is the only time when Windows will disable split tunneling, the feature that sends traffic&nbsp;through the&nbsp;VPN only when
 it is otherwise inaccessible. The split tunneling feature is useful in most corporate situations as&nbsp;you do not need all internet traffic going through your network, just&nbsp;traffic going behind the company firewall.&nbsp;Also, this is usually a faster option since
 you can get to most sites faster through&nbsp;normal WiFi or LTE than you could through your VPN. Again, some folks like us would rather all traffic go through the VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it seems like a major VPN bug, or at least a poor analysis of the use cases for VPN that there is no explicit option to force traffic through it. That option existed in Windows Phone 8.1 and was very helpful so why it's missing is anyone's guess. However,
 you can get this to work like you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those concerned about the protocol used when connecting with "Automatic," the strategy Microsoft uses to connect is first IKEv2, then SSTP, then L2TP, and finally PPTP. This has been the case since Windows 7 with the "Automatic" VPN protocol type. That
 is from most secure to least secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in my testing I found that the connection must be setup from scratch as Automatic to disable split tunneling. Once it is changed to a specific protocol and saved, split tunneling for that connection is enabled, which is the opposite of what you want.
 So please keep that in mind. You can edit other items like the connection name, username, and password, but keep the&nbsp;protocol as Automatic always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have not yet found any way to manually fix the DNS leak which occurs when using VPN on Windows 10 Mobile. You can do so on Windows 10 desktop, just not mobile. So even though you can disable split tunneling, the leak will exist and is just something
 to be aware of. I have no issues with that since my use for VPN is to secure connections over public&nbsp;WiFi, not completely hide which sites I visit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone finds this helpful.&nbsp; Good luck with your VPN's everyone!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip! However, the L2TP VPN is still broken. L2TP as you know has many auth methods you can choose on PC, but on mobile the implementation of L2TP is so poor that it is unable to negociate the correct protocol. I've tested my own vpn server
 and a paid solution. Both work on my iphone, ipad, macbook, pc, Galaxy S6 and another android tablet. On my 950 it does not work, always same error messages 628.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft paid absolutely no attention to this feature on this OS. No Send All Traffic switch, so the user can control this, L2TP broken. Using automatic is not always usefull. Maybe the L2TP server is different than the PPTP one...</p>

            <p>I'm facing the same issue with my Lumia95XL .</p>
<p>I was not using the insider preview software and OS , So i guessed maybe Microsoft have solved this issue and if i update to insider program ans get the release preview it will fix the issue which DID NOT .</p>
<p>I have tried PPTP , Cisco and IKEV2 VPNs and none of them work .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really amazed that not only Microsoft is not fixing this issue , they have not published anything acknowledging this issue .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another 950XL which does not have this issue and is working fine . My 930 which is on slow ring is working OK as well . it's just my main primary device that i use 24/7 that is not working , restoring the phone and updating to release preview did
 not work .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft , just please fix this .</p>

<p>Because they don't give a damn about this OS or about quality. Maybe someone from MS cares to explain how is this OS business ready when one of the most used VPN methods: L2TP is not working??</p>
<p>And don't give me that crap of reset your device! L2TP VPN does not work for more than a year now, ever since Windows 10 mobile hit the market!</p>
