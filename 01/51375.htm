<h2>            Computer failure after Windows 10 Updates</h2>
                    <p>My computer won't start up, and sometimes will malfunction while listening to the radio on the internet. These events follow Windows updates. In between times I have somehow been able to get the computer working again by running the update troubleshooter
 and Windows automatic repair, however the malfunctions continue whenever an update is sent.</p>
<p>(KB 4025342) failed to install on 13/7/17, 21/7/17, 3/8/17, and 5/8/17, and has still not been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(KB 4034674) failed to install on 10/8/17, 12/8/17, 16/8/17, and 19/8/17. Remarkably, it was successfully installed on 20/8/17. I am not sure why it was successfully installed because I had not done anything different to what I had done on the four occasions
 when the updates failed to be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please help to fix this recurring problem <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
permanently?</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the system’s data store and the download folder got desynchronized, resulting in your Windows Updates not working properly. Let's try clearing the
<strong>Software Distribution</strong> folder where all of the updates are stored. Doing so will force Windows Update to download fresh. There’s nothing vital here. Windows Update will recreate what it needs the next time you run it. Please note that doing
 this will also result in losing your Update history. Moreover, the next time you run Windows Update, it will result in a longer detection time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you'll need to stop the Windows Update related services by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Start </strong>menu and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command one after the other and hit <strong>Enter</strong>:</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net stop cryptSvc</span></strong><strong>net stop bits</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net stop msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, follow these steps to empty the Software Distribution folder:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to: <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong></li><li>Delete everything within the folder. Do <strong>NOT </strong>delete the folder itself.</li><li>Restart your computer and give Windows Update another try to see if the issue still exists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, let’s restart the&nbsp;</span>Windows Update related services by typing the following commands one after the other and hitting on
<strong>Enter </strong>in <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start bits</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</span></strong><span>To close the </span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, type
<span><strong>Exit</strong> and hit on <strong>Enter</strong>. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<p>Hi Thanks for your questions but they have all been tried and nothing works. So decided to dump sticky notes which slows down so drastically with every automatic upgrade and it does not allow undo on automatic upgrades. &nbsp;I am now fed up of trying to get
 it fixed as even the tech support people want $85 to try and so decided to use an external notes system outside of Windows.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>1 Purple vertical line on Surface 3 screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fireblaze97  say:</h3>
<h2>            1 Purple vertical line on Surface 3 screen</h2>
                    <p>So as the title says. Last night I was watching youtube then BAM one small purple vertical line popped up and ran through the screen. So I dropped what I was doing and followed the repair procedure steps as directed on the Request repair menu. 2am mind you.
 I downloaded the repair tool, and it went away. Solution solved right? Nope, I launched youtube again to see if it would happen for a second time and BAM there it was again. Theres a picture below of it doing this last night (Second time). When the second
 time happened it eventually changed color, flickered and turned blue only on dark areas. After that It went away and never returned. I have a rugged case, and a glass screen protector on it, and have never EVER dropped it. Now I scheduled a repair, (still
 in warranty) but now its not doing it. I cant even replicate this again, I have tried over and over again but cannot get this to happen again. I know from other devices this could be cause from a fault with the ribbon connection, or overworked graphics card,
 but nothing would replicate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im considering holding off on sending it in, BUT I need a second opinion. All my files sync to OneDrive
 so id just need to sign out of everything, my only concern is I am almost positive I would get a refurbished unit back (not my old one). This tablet I love, its fast and the response is phenomenal. Ive protected the screen with a glass protector too so Id
 have to re buy another one... That and I really need this around for my classes, so not sure how quickly the repair or exchange process is. Noticed shipping is one day on the label.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts or suggestions? Again its not doing it now and hasn't since last night. The shipping label only lets me ship Mon-Fri.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your query, we suggest that you postpone the return of your device since the problem is not present at the moment. The problem could be caused by a software glitch, it may or may not happen again. Since you are using your Surface 3 for your classes,
 it is important that we are certain that the device needs repair and that our people from our service center will have enough knowledge on what's causing the problem. In that way the repair process will be faster.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Oculus &#47; VR Headsets</h2>
                    <p>Will Windows 10 have proper support for VR Devices, so that you can look at your desktop or a 2D Non-Stereo Application without going cross-eyed ?
</p>
<p>I can imagine that Microsoft is passing that buck to Oculus, and Quite Possibly Occulus to Microsoft. But the bottom line exists that dealing with a VR Headset is a Headache in Windows 7, and even so in Windows 8.1, with Holo-Lens on the horizon, and Oculus
 Streaming from XBoxOne it's time for Microsoft to step up and bring their OS into the future.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the Get Windows 10 app to do a compatibility check. Click the menu in the upper left of the app, and select “Check your PC” or “Your PC is good to go.” This displays any compatibility issues we find
 and recommends a resolution; while we don’t have info on every app or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues. If the device is compatible with Windows 10, then you will be able to install. If the device
 is not compatible, then you have to contact your hardware manufacturer for updated patches to be compatible with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span></span>

<p>Thank you for the update and apologies for the delay in responding, Ismet. The reason that I want to know you're current OS build is because there previously an issue with AMD processors making the device unbootable and may be the cause of the you're experiencing.
 This was already resolved during recent updates.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To check for updates now, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>button,&nbsp;and then go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<strong>Windows
 Update</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Check for updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

<h2>            Browser goes to the wrong website</h2>
                    This problem seems to occur at least twice a day.<br />
<br />
When I try to go to a website it re-directs me to some random website, usually some type of search website or Yellowpages.&nbsp; I've scanned using AVG, Ad-Aware, Malwarebytes, and Microsoft Security Essentials and they have not come up with anything.&nbsp; Someone said
 that the scanners may not be working correctly if I downloaded them after this started happening, but I've had MSE since I've bought the computer and it still does nothing.&nbsp; I have tried multiple browsers and they do the same thing.<br />
I have tried putting my computer in SafeMode and it happens there also.<br />
I'm guessing I have to wipe my computer and go back to factory settings, but I'd like to avoid that.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.

            <p>You will not have to reinstall Windows because your browser has been hijacked. Work your way through this list:</p>
<p><br />
1. Perhaps the Hosts file has been infected. Check its contents and/or change it. It is normally located at C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\ If it is not there, look for its location in registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath.</p>
<p>If the file is Read-only, right-click it, click Properties and remove the check mark. Make a backup copy of it, then using Notepad change its contents and save it (not as a .txt file, i.e. it has no extension). If you are unable to access the file, browse
 the Windows folder, right-click notepad.exe and choose Run as Administrator. The file contains a number of comment lines beginning with # followed by IP Address entries, e.g. 127.0.0.1 localhost, which refers to the IPv4 address of this, your computer. Entries
 beginning with ::1 localhost are the newer IPv6 equivalent of IPv4.</p>
<p>A line that begins with 127.0.0.1 stops access by this computer, so don’t remove entries like 127.0.0.1 MalwareWebSite.com as they help to protect the system from accessing malware sites. However, if you see entries with legitimate names like 127.0.0.1 microsoft.com
 or 127.0.0.1 ibm.com, you should remove them, as malware is trying to block access to them (using 127.0.0.1) or, more normally, redirecting them to another website (using n.n.n.n NastyVirus.com). Note that the immunisation feature of programs like Spybot can
 add many malicious websites to the Hosts file, making it quite lengthy.</p>
<p>2. There are a number of registry keys that can be infected and cause redirection. Here are a few of the major ones that should be checked for accuracy. Open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type regedit and press Enter. In the left pane navigate to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\URL\DefaultPrefix.
 The (Default) field in the right pane should contain http://&nbsp; It may be suffixed with something like ehttp.cc/, if so just change it and restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Next, look in the right pane of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN for four keys named Search Page, Start Page, Default_Page_URL and Default_Search_URL. These normally contain a Microsoft address and must be considered suspicious if
 a different or unknown address is present. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, an equivalent HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main key may be present for Search Page and Start Page, ‘Secondary’ keys may be present as well. All these keys should be checked for correctness, i.e. legitimate website addresses that
 the user has created.</p>
<p>3. If you are still being redirected, download/run HijackThis, from here <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Trend-Micro-HijackThis/3000-8022_4-10227353.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Trend-Micro-HijackThis/3000-8022_4-10227353.html</a>&nbsp; and delete any redirection entries beginning with 01, 13 or 17.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. If none of the above resolve the issue, go to the Malware section of this site but thoroughly read the posting instructions first

<h2>            How to fix a broken login screen after disabling safe mode.</h2>
                    <p>When adding some drives to a Windows 10 Machine, safe mode was triggered. Even after removing the extra drives and returning the hardware as it was before, safe mode was still on. After turning off safe mode through msconfig, the computer rebooted all right,
 but when turning on no long has a password prompt at the login screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e382b8f-6386-4a6f-b438-72d44184974c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e382b8f-6386-4a6f-b438-72d44184974c" /></a></p>
<p>I can get access to the drive from another PC so can run any programs or dig into files from there. Nothing of importance is on the drive so if i can just get the product key then I could do a fresh install.</p>

<p>I hit an unknown key in initial set-up of Family Control pass-code. I don't know which&nbsp;4 keys are the code, and I never had a chance to set up a reply to the "Pass code reminder question." Tried downloading profile -- but that seems to be for some other
 kind of pass code? Because it did not appear to erase the Family Control pass code. Is this a phone call to support?</p>

<p>Hi there. Yes unfortunately you will need to contact the xbox support line for this matter. The passcode which can be reset by recovering your account is the xbox LIVE passcode that the account owner sets, not the parental passcode which the parental account
 sets. </p>

    <title>External Hard Drive formatted after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdkray  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive formatted after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have an external hard drive that is&nbsp;capable of holding up to 465 GB. I've been working on a show for YouTube which is mainly comprised of recorded clips from a computer game, and these clips take up a lot of space on my laptop, so I would transfer them
 onto my external HD once I either need to free up space or am done with a video for YouTube and don't necessarily need the clips on my laptop anymore, but still want to keep as a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this big awful&nbsp;Windows 10 update/upgrade, I've realized that the icon for&nbsp;my external hard drive wouldn't show up in the "My Computer" window after I've plugged it in. After looking&nbsp;it up, I found out how to make Windows 10&nbsp;"recognize" it again,&nbsp;but
 I was only able to use it again under one condition -- if I format&nbsp;the external&nbsp;hard drive, or in other words, delete every single file on there and start from scratch. Not knowing what else to do, I went ahead and let the computer format it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, I'd really like to find a way to get all those&nbsp;files back. They are over 3,000 of the video clips that were lost in the process, which consist of the clips I put together for the videos,&nbsp;along with a number of the complete videos themselves&nbsp;that
 are already up on YouTube. I really want to recover them in case something happens to my YouTube account, to keep as a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a program called Recuva, and after running it, it seemed to be able to identify most if not all of&nbsp;the missing video clips, but all of them are labeled "Unrecoverable". I transferred all of these "unrecoverable" clips back onto my external HD but,
 as expected, none of them will open. Even trying to put them into a converter isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what can I do now?</p>

            It sounds like your external drive has failed (according to both <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=average+hard+drive+life+span" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Google: Average Hard Drive Life Span">
Google</a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=average+hard+drive+life+span&amp;qs=HS&amp;pq=average+hard+&amp;sc=8-13&amp;sp=1&amp;cvid=EF00BA53F2B64212AA989C901C04491C&amp;FORM=QBLH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Bing: Average Hard Drive Life Span">
Bing</a>, hard drives only last about 4 years, but that's just the middle average, some die younger). &nbsp;Unless you have yet another backup copy (perhaps in the cloud storage), the files may be unrecoverable. &nbsp;If they are truly valuable, and Recuva wasn't able
 to help further, it's probably time to consult a professional data recovery service.

            <p>I didn't know that external HDs also have a limited lifespan. Well that's not good. Mine is around the four-year-old mark if not more by now, but after the formatting, it looks like it's working again. So I don't think it died.&nbsp;Like I said, I just had to
 format and start from scratch, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had Windows 10, ShadowExplorer was a program I used that could sometimes help me recover deleted or lost files that I wanted back again, but only from about a week ago or so. Are there any similar and easy-to-use programs for Windows 10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or does anyone have any other ideas?</p>

            <p>Yeah the life span for external ones are actually lower because they get moved around.&nbsp; Inside the drive the plates are spinning at over 7200 RPM, and they wear out over time.&nbsp; Now some last longer, some die younger, but the average is 4 years.&nbsp; You can
 read the details in the links (or even on the website of the company that built the drive: they are required by law to publish their statistics).&nbsp; But on average, 80% of drives last 4 years.&nbsp; That means 20% of drives die in that time, and it only goes up from
 there.&nbsp; That's why you should always, always have backups of anything you care about.</p>

</p><p>You might consider running a check-disk on that drive to search for and repair any bad sectors on it.&nbsp; You can do that by right-clicking the drive in the Explorer "This PC" folder, then going to properties. On the tools tab you'll see the option to check
 for errors on the drive.&nbsp; I say this just in case the reason for the failure was a bad area of the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your old program, I take it you can't use it in Windows 10?&nbsp; Or is it just no longer available?

<h2>            Error 0000</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed the 64 bit Windows 7 onto my computer, and all was well until this last week when an error began appearing immediately upon logging in to the desktop. I believe the code is Error 0000. Any direction towards a solution would be appreciated.</p>

<div>Hi Aaro,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Do you remember any changes to your machine prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b) Are you able to boot to the desktop?</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Boot your computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following article to boot your computer in safe mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong> <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Restart your computer back to normal later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not persist, then there could be a third party software that is conflicting and causing the issue to occur, hence, I'd suggest you to put your computer in a
<strong>clean boot </strong>state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</div>

<p>Have you checked to make sure a proxy is not in use?</p>
<p>You might consider temporarily uninstalling Bitdefender, rebooting, then seeing if anything changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a DNS related issue you might want to try an alternate primary DNS server like Google's 8.8.8.8. Your DHCP server/router's time is off by nearly 90 years, that might also be creating an issue. I suggest addressing that. Your log file was huge
 mainly due to excessive crashes brought on by&nbsp;ygopro. I am not sure what effect this has on your everyday desktop stability.</p>

<div>Hi Bill33308,</div>
<div><br />
Are you able to boot to the desktop?</div>

There are many reasons where the Windows Updates fail to install, most of it is caused by security software.</div>

            The SFC scan reported no problems that could not be corrected.&nbsp; In fact none of the the processes reported fixing or finding any problems, from what I could see on the display.&nbsp; I will try the PA Bear processes, but the computer has been protected by McAfee
 , for the internet and virus since day one.&nbsp; In addition there is a router between the internet point and the computer that was installed far before this problem occurred.

You should be using Step #2b ("Run this scan instead: <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Did a McAfee or Norton free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<h2>            1440p resolution with 120hz, AMD free-sync and HDR600</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought monitor supporting all technologies mentioned in title and huge part of its usage ment to be gaming on Xbox one X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I managed to set 1440p with 120hz or AMD free-sync (for some reason I can't use both at the time).
</p>
<p>I also managed to set HDR, but in 4K mode, problem with it is that once I do it colors are washed out and in calibration tool, black and white colors have limited range.</p>
<p>I read about HDR in Xbox One Support Site, but mentioned HDR requirements match only HDR10. My HDR600 have no use now.<br />
</p>
<p>My monitor is Samsung C27HG70, it's great and colors are just awesome, but this lack of support is really annoying and I waste hours to adjust settings to state in which I use it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to use all of this at the same time? Or is there any information about solving this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please inform me if I picked wrong category</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi all you guys,</p>
<p>I am sorry for such late reply, I had less time for gaming and tweaking, but I think that I've found settings that suit me the most. For now I use two sets of options 1440p, 120hz, fast response and 1440p(4k mode), HDR, 60hz, Freesync. First one I think
 it's a matter of very own preferences, while the second one was tricky to set. This video helped me a lot:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/Q1fE58tg_S8</p>
<p>It was also a base for my settings, but I use my own variant soo:</p>
<p>Game tab:</p>
<p>Picture mode: Custom</p>
<p>Black equalizer:16-17</p>
<p>Freesync: Standard Engine( or Ultimate if you don't spot that much little blue blurr)</p>
<p>Picture tab:</p>
<p>Change Color before you enter a game to 100 Red, Green, Blue, Color Tone Custom, Gamma mode2</p>
<p>Brightness 100</p>
<p>Contrast 60</p>
<p>Sharpness 68</p>
<p>System tab:</p>
<p>Local dimming on (just to be sure that it work)</p>
<p>Now colors with HDR seems to have wider range and deepness, before it was too washed out, using colors on 100 it looks juicy during bright scenes, but black was to red-green, I turned on freesync that seems to create some more blue, ultimate ever little
 blue blurr, contrasting objects and that solved my problem to the end.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>
<p>That was really helpfull discution.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>hinek</p>

<h2>            Canon MP Navigator EX 3.1 fails to start in XP SP3 &#40;CanoScan 9000F&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Just purchased CanoScan 9000F - installed software from the supplied disk.&nbsp; Completed sucessfully.&nbsp; Connected scanner.&nbsp; Can access all associated software - however when attempting to start Navigator form either the quick menu, from the shortcut or from
 the program menu - mpnex31.exe starts graps 515 of the cpu and will run forever and never actually start up.&nbsp; I've actually let it run over 60 minutes of cpu just to see what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; No error messages - just no Navigator screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalled Navigator - reinstalled 3.1 - then tried 4.0 same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall all of the sofeware associated with the scanner - reinstalled again succesful - but Nav will not start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

<h2>            Printing emails off windows mail</h2>
                    <p>This is the second time this has happened to me since the 1903 update. I can't print off any of emails that i receive in Windows Mail, no matter which printer i choose. Forward the emails so i can read them in Outlook or Virgin Media Mail and there is no
 problem. I have tried to go into settings and reset the mail and calendar app but i does no good. If i do work in office and print that there is no problems.</p>

            Hi George
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Several users have been reporting this issue for some time now with Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />It appears to be partially broken. You can try the steps below, but ultimately, it is probably best you use a different Email client such as the free Mozilla Thunderbird. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<br />
<br />In Mail, click the Settings represented by the gear icon at the bottom
<br />Click Manage accounts
<br />Select your account
<br />Click Delete this account from this device.
<br />
<br />Restart Mail, then set it up again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Scroll down to Mail
<br />Select it
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Check the Store for updates 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: powershell
<br />Right click powershell
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

            Hi George.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A workaround until we can get it fixed is to Save the email from the Settings Hub (three dots at top right next to URL box), then print the file you saved.  
<br />
<br />What often works is to go to Windows 10 Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  See this setup guide to make sure you get everything set as you like:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-mail-app-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>but i can hardly ever find a game on here, people need to get back on and play!</p>

<p>I find it to vary between the modes, although there are sometimes in "Wanted" it does take up to 5mins to find 5 more members to get a game going.</p>
<p>Personally, I think all the dedicated players got bored of the headless chicken acts that happen within the game.... I;ve only got back into it due to the same reason!</p>
<p>Best bet is to make friends, then at least you've got a few people to get a player match started</p>

<p>Yes it takes a while to find a session but there are some people around.</p>
<p>I don't have the DLC and I don't have that much trouble finding a match. Just don't be too picky about it, most matches are always Wanted or sometimes Alliance</p>

<h2>            Different desktops for different users</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just bought new computer with windows 10. I've created 2 user accounts, both as an administrator. I expected, that both users have their own desktop, with their own shortcuts. After new software installation (on one account) new shortcut is automatically
 added on second user's desktop. Deleting this shortcut on 2'nd user desktop automatically delete it on 1'st one's. How may I fully separate both users dekstops?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Kuba</p>

            I don't think this is a Windows desktop issue but more of an issue of when you installed the software. 
<br />When you install some software it sometimes asks if you want to add a desktop shortcut for "current user" or "Everyone".
<br />The default for most software installs is "Everyone".
<br />And so when you removed the icon it removed it for Everyone.
<br />
<br />If you just want to add it back for one user just go to the program in the start menu and drag it to the desktop.

    <title>windows 10 activation &#40;think i nearly got scammed&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakelilley  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 activation &#40;think i nearly got scammed&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a custom built PC from Overclockers UK a few years ago, It had windows 7 (I assume an OEM version). When windows 10 came out I upgraded, a while later I changed my motherboard not realising it would deactivate my copy of windows. Around a year later
 and I am finally trying to activate, I did some research and found I could by an OEM key from the internet for pretty cheap, so I went to Kinguin as I have used them before to by games and they had been recommended by a popular tech youtuber. Since the pro
 and home versions were pretty much the same price I went with the pro version, I found this didn't work and after some more research I came to the conclusion that it would activate if I had windows 10 pro installed, it seemed the only way to do that was to
 get the media creation tool from Microsoft&nbsp; and use it download windows 10 pro, this didn't work as it didn't give me the option for the pro version, I imagined it might give the option after downloading and installing it. Before I did that I tried the windows
 10 home key that Kinguin sold, that key didn't work either. So I did a clean reinstalled of windows 10, tried both the keys again and they still did not work. I went back to Kinguin and checked there activation instructions, they say that the keys are not
 for upgrading which explains why the pro key didn't work but not the home one, they also recommended. I followed there activation instructions that ended up not working in which case I was to activate by phone, the instructions had me type SLUI 04 into the
 run thing in windows, this then provided me with a number and a long code, I called the number and they asked for the code and the activation key and then they asked me to activate it exactly as I already had, when this didn't work I was passed onto a support
 team who did the same stuff then passed me onto "Microsoft support", Microsoft support did the same as the other two then verified that the key was real and provided me with a case number that I could provide to Microsoft support to verify the legitimacy of
 the call. He then went on to ask for access to my C: drive at which point alarm bells started ringing, he sent me to a micro soft support page for remote access which had terms and conditions to accept at which point I told him I was going to go verify the
 case number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR; got 2 dodgy windows keys they didn't work so I called support who tried to gain access to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Was this a scam or would Microsoft support actually ask for access to your PC to fix something?</p>
<p>2. Should the method of activation worked?</p>
<p>3. Were the keys fake?</p>
<p>4. Is there actually a legitimate way of activating windows without spending £120?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading and any responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*edit: Also, how do I contact legitimate Microsoft?</p>

            Hi  Jake.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are no discount product keys so if you buy one you're throwing away your money.  
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you originally upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.  
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;We recently learned the Troubleshooter will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />If not you'll need to contact Microsoft Support, asking for Activation help, then keep asking for an agent.  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />1. Yes, sometimes Microsoft support may ask for access to your PC.
<br />2. It may work for some time, and it may not work, but this is not significant, because you do not have a license.
<br />3. Likely, see below.
<br />4. There is no  a legitimate way of using Windows without _buying_license_. Please note, "Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed." (c) EULA
<br />
<br />Microsoft warns at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop....</a>
<br />
<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 System Backup can&#39;t unselect other drive.</h2>
                    <p>So when I want to use the Windows backup function it wants to backup my games HDD as well.</p>
<p>There are no pagefiles on it, it is not active, bootloader is on C etc. etc.</p>
<p>All I have installed there is Steam, Origin and GOG things... I don't need my games backed up but it just wont let me choose. When I unplug the "Games" drive it lets me backup just fine.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply but this is not an external drive so unplugging it is troublesome as I have to open my case every time I want to make a backup.</p>
<p>Is there a reason why this particular drive must be in the backup and not one of my 3 other internal drives?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong> for Windows 8.1 Pro using Windows 10 ADK 10.0.17763.1:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters</p>
<p>DWORD: IRPStackSize</p>
<p>VALUE(decimal): 50</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Stuck with</strong> Windows 10 PE still, well the PE only has ~500MB space at system drive X: while booted from DVD and can't figure out why the "Not enough free space.", while the drive having the WIM and exporting the ESD has over 900GB of space.
 Perhaps I am missing something like explaining dism.exe where the "temp\" or "tmp\" is located. I did try "set TMP=C:\TEMP" and "set TEMP=C::\TEMP" where C: is the 1TB HDD, but seems still ending up same
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if someone else has this error at installed system there's sort of solution, if someone got idea how to solve the Windows PE side error would be nice.</p>

<p>Boot with your install media or Windows PE. Get a Command Prompt (SHIFT-F10 from first screen of install media setup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you run your export from WIM to ESD, create the folders <strong>\Recycler\Scratch</strong> on the partition that has 900GB empty. When you run the export command, add
<strong>/ScratchDir=C:\Recycler\Scratch</strong> or use whatever drive letter has the 900GB space. You need a drive with minimum 1024MB for a Scratch directory.&nbsp; Windows PE does not have 1024 room in its RAM disk (Drive X:).</p>

<p>That worked miracles, thanks for the solution for WinPE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes me wonder, if the ScratchDir could be located in ramdrive like extending the PE WIM or using 3rd party solutions to have that ~1024MB. Assuming ScratchDir being written same time at same drive where WIM is read and ESD is written causes quite some
 IO loss. RAM/Memory would be way faster solution.</p>

    <title>Fan Speed during startup &#40;Win XP &#40;Home&#41;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sheronalvinloop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fan Speed during startup &#40;Win XP &#40;Home&#41;&#41;</h2>
                    Sometimes when my computer gets to the windows logo screen during loading, the fan speed goes very high and the computer slows down. Another thing that usually happens with it is that my low-resources theme settings are automatically reverted to the default
 theme. I can only restart the computer then to make it come back to normal. And the theme settings are back to the customized settings again. Anyone know about this or can explain it?<br />
Thanks.<br />

"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart . We're Just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you. If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (igdkmd64.sys)"<br />
<br />
This will only happen if I am connected to the internet, my PC will stay on if I unplug my network cable but as soon as I reconnect to the internet it will appear within 1 minute. Please help me correct this issue. I am currently accessing the web via my laptop
 so I can download files if necessary and transfer them to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rory</p>

            Hi Rory,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your interest on windows 10 and also providing issue in detail. Don't worry about this issue we will help you to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt&nbsp;network adapter drivers and also due to incorrect network settings.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall network adapter drivers from manufacturer web site and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not work so I would suggest you to <br />
Try to go in safe mode and perform clean Boot and Run SFC scan and Run DISM Tool .<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Follow the link to get in safe mode:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to follow these methods and check. </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1. Clean Boot</strong><br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;Disclaimer: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</div>

<div><strong>Method 2. Run SFC scan.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to scan your system files and to repair
 missing or corrupted system files in Windows.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><br />
&nbsp;Note: This article is also applicable for Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3. Run the DISM Tool. <br />
</strong>&nbsp;Run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;1. Click on 'Start'. <br />
&nbsp;2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<br />
&nbsp;4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:<br />
&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
&nbsp;to close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.</div>

            <p>My wife and I upgraded to Windows 10 and I had no issues, but she did. &nbsp;We have all of the same hardware except CPU. &nbsp;Hers rebooted with the "system thread exception not handled in windows igdkmd64.sys" error repeatedly a minute or so after boot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way it didn't was if the system is started in safe mode. &nbsp;We tried uninstalling video drivers and rebooting because a forum said it was a GEForce driver manager / Windows updater compatibility issue ... didn't work. &nbsp;So, we tried to go back to Windows
 7 and it wouldn't allow it because all users had to be deleted. &nbsp;We didn't figure out how to log in as admin and remove the user she was currently logged in as so one more try on removing the nvidia drivers and now it just boots to a black screen, audio works
 and can hear it log in along with skype launching ... never having any video from the graphics card or the motherboard. &nbsp;We don't have OS software on disk ... windows 7 we have the upgrade DVD but can't switch it to boot from disk because there is no display.
 &nbsp;</p>

            <p>So ... I pulled out the graphics card and the MOBO displayed worked. &nbsp;I also pulled the ethernet cable and the system didn't error/reboot. &nbsp;I ran through the above stated method 2 and 3. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the sfc scan:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. &nbsp;Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios.<br />
</p>
<p>After the DISM.exe ... /Scanhealth</p>
<p>The component store is repairable:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The operation complete succussfully</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the DISM.exe ... /Restorehealth:&nbsp;</span>Error: 0x800f0906</p>
<p>The source files cannot be downloaded</p>
<p>Use the "source" option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature. &nbsp;For more information on the specifying a source location, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077.</p>
<p>The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm definitely out of my league here, but if sfc/DISM can't connect to the internet to repair because the system reboots it doesn't help. &nbsp;I'd just go back to windows 7, but I can't because I can't delete the user.</p>

 exact same results. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To go into depth regarding the sfc scan, the corrupted file was some png image for microsoft edge (C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\Assets\MicrosoftEdgeSquare44x44.scale-125_contrast-white.png)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>And the error I&nbsp;received&nbsp;with the BSOD 1-2 minutes after plugging in the ethernet cable was:&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE:</span><br />
I also receive the same BSOD error (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA_(igdkmd64.sys)) when trying to download intel graphics driver updates from a flash drive.</span><br />
I rebooted into safe mode and installed the intel graphics driver updates from the flash drive without getting the BSOD halfway through the update. After restarting (as prompted) I got a BSOD before reaching the sign-in screen; again with the same error (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA_(igdkmd64.sys)).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This cycle of restarting and blue-screening continued a few more times until I got the option for advanced startup, which then let me restart into safe mode again so I could uninstall the intel graphics

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I am now back to square one: unable to plugin ethernet cable without getting the dreaded BSOD,&nbsp;</span>with the same error (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA_(igdkmd64.sys)).</span></p>

            <p>This would have been helpful about 2 hours ago...I was able to boot into safe mode then. When I was in safe mode I turned off what I thought were the offending startup programs and drivers. However one of these drivers was the network which made it impossible
 to actually upgrade the network driver to support windows 10...see the issue here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has since progressed to the point where it boots, tries to log me in, will not let me attempt to set safe mode start and reboots right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no boot media for windows 10, and this is my main computer with basically my life on it...any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and I am not getting the BSOD just a silent reboot.</p>
