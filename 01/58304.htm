            <p>Hello Hanifthotathil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can Download and Install the Printer drivers from the link below and check.</p>

    <title>Windows Unexpected Shutdown with no blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> westonvorderberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Unexpected Shutdown with no blue screen</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a brand new Dell XPS 8300 desktop computer. The day of first use I received 2 blue screen erros. Dell had me reinstall the operating system and drivers the next day. The following day I received another blue screen error. Dell repeated
 the last solution. Yet again, the solution did not solve the problem. They also ran a diagnostics test to find an issue in one of the USB ports (it wasn't plugged in). After going through several other technicians and "solutions", they finally sent me replacement
 parts (hardrive, memory, motherboard). The technician installed all of the parts and everything looked great. After using it for several hours, though, it shut down and restarted on me. The blue screen did not show up and I received no indication of automatic
 restart due to updating. What could be the problem? The computer is not getting hot and the reliability history only tells me that windows experienced an unexpected shutdown. Please help me resolve this issue. It was an expensive computer and I've only had
 it for a week!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unexpected Shutdown could be because of an issue with Uninterrupted Power supply (UPS). If you are using a UPS, make sure it is connected properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, update graphics card and other drivers from the manufacturer’s website and see if that helps:</p>
<p>Follow the article mentioned below:</p>
<p><b><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</span></b></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Also make sure that the newly installed hardware has updated drivers.</p>

            Hi Davee,
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can install that application
<br />
<br />Please do not leave Controlled Folder Access turned off permanently

<h2>            Windows 10 64-bit pro reserves 8GB of RAM for hardware out of 16GB installed.</h2>
                    <p>Windows version: 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>Installed RAM: 16GB DDR3 running in 10-10-10-27 1600Mhz</p>
<p>AMD x6 965 BE Processor. Not overclocked.</p>
<p>Gigabyte 970A-DS3P Motherboard.</p>
<p>8GBx2 RAM Corsair vengeance.</p>
<p>BIOS shows RAM as 16GB correctly.</p>
<p>Windows shows 16GB as screenshots show below.</p>
<p>Yet, over half of it is hardware reserved.</p>
<p>I have tried all usual mechanisms: Boot max memory option uncheck/check, Registry for PageFile, updating BIOS, sfc /scannow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing works.</p>
<p>I even shifted RAM sticks correctly, installed one at a time, and they work perfectly.</p>
<p>What's weird is my GTX 750Ti shows a approx memory of 6080MB !&nbsp;<br />
Anyone can help me map all RAM to Windows ? Screenshots with info are below&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Anandasubramanian,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did your graphics card GTX 750Ti come with 6GB of Video RAM?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some of the graphics card share the systems&nbsp;RAM with the graphics RAM, so that you can play games with few more frame rates therefore games play more smoothly.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-750-ti/specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-750-ti/specifications</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can please check the specification of your graphics card and confirm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GTX 750Ti comes with 2GB GDDR5 memory. CPU-Z screenshot is shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6610eece-e223-4b24-ba30-d646c54d498b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6610eece-e223-4b24-ba30-d646c54d498b" /></a></p>
<p>However, when i probed DxDiag, i got the info about 6GB. Screenshot from Dxdiag below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0541580-7c6f-42d1-891a-90dfd2e5d47d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0541580-7c6f-42d1-891a-90dfd2e5d47d" /></a></p>
<p>Even assuming an additional 4GB was "smart" allocated to Graphics card, what happened to the rest 4GB??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can Windows 10 do that arbitrarily? I need the RAM for running MATLAB.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            I am experiencing slow web page loading.  Less than 10&#37; of my ISP 1 Gbps service.</h2>
                    I am experiencing slow web page loading and I am only getting download speeds of less than 100Mbps&nbsp; I am paying for 1Gbps with 50Mbps uplink.&nbsp; Uplink speeds are normal.&nbsp; I down speeds were almost 1Gbps when I first upgraded to 1Gbps service but have been
 less than 10% of that for several months.&nbsp; My ISP sent a technician to resolve the issue but he informed me that my NetGear R6220 is not allowing the speed and that because the router was just over two years old, Netgear no longer supported firmware updates.&nbsp;
 I installed a new Medialink&nbsp; WIRELESS GIGABIT ROUTER MLWR-AC1200 and that failed to increase the internet speeds.&nbsp; I attached my PC 1Gbps Wired LAN directly to my Arris SB6190 and the tested speeds were above 900Mbps download and above 50Mbps uploads.&nbsp; Is
 there any way for me to be able to force my ISP to stop throttling my router speeds?

            What router did they recommend you have?  The ISP usually can't throttle you unless you are doing something they have deemed to be illegal, which I assume you are not.  What ISP are you using?  <br /><br />The easiest way to bypass this would be to try a vpn to see if it makes a difference or use a router based on their recommendations or their proprietary one.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Yomy Thomas

<p>Suddenlink.net out of Texas is my sISP.</p>
<p>The tech saw the Mediabridge 1Gbps AC1200 router that I already had on hand and said it would work.</p>
<p>I had planned to use it as a wifi AP in the house farthest from the working router.</p>
<p>I am not a novice user and I try to stay up with the latest technology.</p>
<p>I usually wait untill the bugs have been worked out of the newest and fastest products before making a purchase decision.</p>
<p>I purchased the Mediabridge router early this year but had not put it in service yet because I had intended to test it before programming it and giving it a SSID and existing passwords to allow family members easy connection.</p>
<p>I am not doing anything that is illegal</p>
<p>I have run speed tests on my LAN to check my LAN health and have checked for possible RF interference possibly leaking into the ISP RG 6 coax cable prior to the cable modem (I installed shielded direct burial RG 6 coax prior to having cable ISP setvice over
 ten years ago. &nbsp;I know that my ISP had to nond channels and I had to purchase a DOS36coax</p>

<p>CABLE MODEM DOSC 3 to order the 1Gbps service. &nbsp;All was well until the cable servive raised their rates again and I turned in all the leased video hardware. &nbsp;I started noticing slower than normal web page loading and ran speed tests and LAN tests to rule
 out my hardware being a possibility for the slow speeds.</p>
<p>I will really be surprised if both of my routers have the same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ordered t new Cat7 shielded patch cables to install between the modem and the router and between the router and &nbsp;my pc and LAN.</p>

            Hmmm...... very interesting, you know your stuff but it's usually no real way to circumvent a ISP from doing what it wants other than switching ISPs.  I've switched a few time due to slow downs and typically if I complain enough I either got a lower bill or a higher speed.  I'm currently using comcast and my speeds are great but sometimes I get slowed down when someone is  using Netflix and I'm gaming at the same time, but it's not noticeable.<br /><br />Let me know the outcome Mr. Jerry,<br />Yomy Thomas

<p><em>I have two PCs in the office&nbsp;</em><em>directly behind this PC.</em></p>
<p><em>They are configured the same as this one except they both have 4Gb more RAM, ARE THREE YEARS OLDER, and one has a normal SATA HDD, and the other has a SATA SDD like this PC.</em></p>
<p>I access all of my LAN pcs using Chrome Remote Desktop software by Google.</p>
<p><em>Last night I checked the one with the normal HHD to see if the Microsoft updates had been successful. The&nbsp;LAN speeds were somewhat less than I had expected with the 1Gb LAN ethernet&nbsp;DELL motherboards but the test did verify that the LAN was OK.</em></p>
<p><em>I also downloaded, installed, and ran the Okla&nbsp;internet speed test&nbsp;and was surprised to see the ethernet download speeds were above 900Mbps and uploads speeds were above 60Mbps.</em></p>
<p><em>The one with the SSD is connected to the LAN via wifi&nbsp;(no other ethernet&nbsp;cable is readily available in that office&nbsp;</em><em>and&nbsp;that PC has no monitor, keyboard, or mouse attached.&nbsp; I just have it on so auto updates will take place without my assistance.&nbsp;

            ITunes and the ipod are not the problem. My device manager is blank. I can't see what I have or troubleshoot anything. The ipod and GARMIN problems led me to look in the device manager and that was when I found it blank. While reading the boards looking
 for a solution, I noticed that many of us are having this problem with the device manager in Windows 7,&nbsp;and setting Plug and Play to Automatic and checking the registry is not the answer.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Suspect 3rd party applications especially antivirus programs. Is Device Manger available<br />
in Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot)? <br />
<br />
Run SFC /scannow and checkdisk (chkdsk /f r/ ) and then if needed try a Clean Boot. Check<br />
again in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

            As usual, blame any company BUT Microsoft for something that is obviously an OS issue and is documented all over the internet in various forums. The bottom line is that one day the Device Manager is populated as it should be and the next day is suddenly
 a blank screen with nothing but a title and menu bar. How can you as an MVP even consider blaming a 3rd party especially with the problem being discussed in so many forums online?
<div><br />
<div>Try to resolve a hardware or driver issue without Device Manager functioning as it should. Even worse is upgrading/rebuilding a system and having a blank Device Manager when the hardware isn't detected or working properly. That is what I was faced with
 recently and had no idea whether the hardware was the problem or something with the drivers. I do know that the same time the Device Manager went blank other functionality of the system seemed to have been effected as well.</div>

<p>What your saying is that your WLID is linked to 2 accounts? But you can't recover the other account b/c you don't know the password to the old one? You will need to contact support for a password change request, for the account of JR, but in the mean time
 you will need to change the WLID attached to this account.</p>

<h2>            Skype privacy holes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have uncovered that the skype app for mobile shows contact suggestions with 'mutual contacts'. However, this is in my opinion a severe breach in privacy. If you have friends on skype, who themselves have no friends, they can directly see which
 friends you have. It is also highly unprofessional in a business setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I disable it so that I do not share my skype contacts with this discovery feature? Since I do appreciate my privacy and don't like to share my contacts with other people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p>

            Yes, this is probably a last straw for me with Skype.&nbsp; Someone on my contact list who has an account just to talk to me found this out, and now can see everyone that I talk to on Skype, which is now creating all sorts of problems.&nbsp; There appears to be
 absolutely no way to prevent this, and who knows how long this has even been possible.&nbsp; Also the option to hide the number of contacts you have on the Skype profile is inexplicably gone.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I actually noticed this as well yes. For me not nearly as big of a problem as the former, but still annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is, is that nowadays every app wants to be the go-to app for everything. Every app has to have video chatting, messaging, 'stories' feature, social networking etc etc. Instagram already made this mistake once by trying to be more like
 snapchat with messages and stories, and lost a lot of market to snapchat because of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree for you, if there's no proper response from microsoft to this, I will have to shift to a competitor like discord as well.</p>

<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "Discover" feature is HIGHLY intrusive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very presumptuous of the Skype developers to believe we want our Contacts to be listed in the "Discover" feature, or ourselves to be included in such a list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to make it very clear that this functionality MUST be an option and that our anonymity is guaranteed. &nbsp;At the moment, our privacy is being eroded.</p>

<p>Hello Rockzers, tiamat89 and&nbsp;CharliCat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we understand that you want to disable the suggested contacts option in Skype, it is currently unavailable. However, you can opt out from being searched in the public directory or suggested friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To opt out of being discoverable in Skype search:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chats </strong>screen, tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Tap the <strong>settings</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2fsettings_new_1.png" />&nbsp;button.&nbsp;</li><li>Tap <strong>Privacy</strong>, and then tap <strong>Include me in search and suggestions</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
You can make yourself discoverable again by turning this option back on at any time.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>This new feature does make it slightly easier to add the right people on Skype, and it doesn’t really step on your privacy. Your contacts cannot see your suggested contacts and vice versa. Skype App is evolving into a social network by introducing mutual
 contacts suggestion. We ensure that we will build the next generation of Skype.&nbsp;For more information, please see:

Who can see my profile information in the new Skype?</a><br />
​</p>
<p>Should you have questions and concerns, please do not hesitate to reply.</p>

<p>I still don't understand the move towards a 'social media platform'. What is wrong with just being the best at what you do? I don't want 10 different websites who all claim to do everything, consumers just want one app for video calling, one for social networking,
 etc. If an app like instagram for image sharing wants to become a social networking site, it is a bit strange but still sort of okay, since there is already sharing and friend groups forming. This is not the case with skype. Highly peculiar that Microsoft
 is wanting to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if this is the case, rivaling platforms all have options to disable this. Let's take for example Instagram, they have an option that removes your friends from showing up in the suggestions of other friends. Why can't skype do the same? Why is a user
 forced to share his/her contacts with others? Even if the move is towards a social media platform, the key in that would always be privacy, no other social media platform violates privacy like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the 'next generation of Skype', then to be honest, I also expect that this is the downfall of Skype.&nbsp;</p>

            I just want to share that I had a similar concern and agree that it is a privacy hole, which also appears to be intentionally put in place. As pointed out by Rockzer, it is a fundamental requirement for becoming a successful social platform to carefully
 respect users privacy. It is clearly not the case. The least you could do was to make it feasible for the users to actively prevent this.

<h2>            SSD hard drive locked, how to &#34;unlock&#34;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Toshiba laptop</p>
<p>Windows 8</p>
<p>1TB SSD, 500GB hd</p>
<p>Windows recovery USB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in the process of salvaging files from my friend's computer when my computer randomly crashed. When I tried to boot up, it got past the Toshiba screen then a black screen where it scanned for media. It told me there was no media to boot from and asked
 for a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I plugged in the Windows recovery USB. Tried all available options. Refresh and Restore don't work, says the hard drive is locked. I have a very limited understand of DOS. Disklist shows disk 0 (main) and disc 1 (recovery I think). Disk 0 has no partitions
 (weird?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues while booting to the computer. We will certainly help you with the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the BIOS settings to make the USB drive detected. You can also refer to the manual provided by the computer’s manufacturer to check how to do and change if required.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to follow the suggestions by<strong> Phanlon7</strong> on October12, 2013 to fix the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I ran the Bootrec commands. The automatic option didn't work for me, and I ended up resetting the computer. I used my spare drive for this, so the information on the SSD is intact(ish). I tried to swap drives, since the reading I've done made me think the
 issue is with BIOS and that issue has been resolved. It appears I'm wrong, and the SSD is still not a recognized drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can use my recovery USB, I would say drive is being detected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read in places that changing UEFI settings could do the trick, or something to do with RAID vs. ACHI... I have no idea what any of those things are, though.</p>

    <title>1803 issues with AMD hardware and software Dell Inspiron 15 5576 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelshanks1  say:</h3>
<h2>            1803 issues with AMD hardware and software Dell Inspiron 15 5576</h2>
                    <p>I have recovered from a Full PC Reset and chose option All drives for full reset and waited for the work to finish.</p>
<p>When TPM popped up I chose Esc to keep my TPM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the same issues with the same up to date drivers as before on the other configuration....</p>
<p>I just got done updating all of Dell's drivers 2 days ago and the machine is showing the signs of stuttering with audio and hangs and freezes with the SSD Drive where the OS is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to get out of the not being able to click or select anything on screen...I have to ctrl+alt+delete....and then I can click a button or whatever I can do online...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and ,I haven't tested the Baffin drivers version 17.7.1 yet..but will once all my steam games get re-installed....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bios,CPU security and performance update for the FX-9830p,GPU switchable Graphics R7/RX560-aka the Baffin series...Firmware updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio is stuttering at times and crackling during web browsing and gaming and as well as watching youtube videos at times...as well as kinda not good quality sound volume with the drivers during games,..some games like Doom have a low sound when using Sony
 headphones...and other games as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just think someone should be testing the machine wright now with all the up to date drivers in a test room if you don't believe me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh and for the CPU update ,I read about the AMD Security Issues and saw my system wasn't affected....I find that hard to believe....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is a link to the issues I have had this video is similar to my issue...yes different systems but similar issues:

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I also see that the Bios you guys write the OS support for is limited...</p>

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)

            <p>All I have seen, is the obvious choices that anybody with a few brain cells would have found, such as the "Adjust brightness" slide bar.&nbsp; For lots of us, the problem is that this option does not show up in the first place, and updating to the latest monitor
 driver, makes no difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, it just blows my mind that the answers given are always the answers that are of absolutely no help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, what I did instead was load a free program called " Gamma Panel ".&nbsp; I then added it to the windows Startup program such that the windows startup included the Gamma Panel program. That way windows automatically starts up this program&nbsp;when I power
 up my computer, and thus I don't have to do anything myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gamma Panel allows you to adjust the Gamma, the Brightness, and the Contrast. Once set, you just save it under a file name of your choosing, and that file will automatically be used by the Gamma Panel program itself in the future. You can make several different
 files, but which ever one you last selected (loaded), will be the one the the Gamma Panel program chooses automatically in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, to make adjustments for a SAMSUNG monitor, I had to set Gamma as .074, Brightness as -0.27, and contrast as 0.70.&nbsp; So it did take a bit of fine tuning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 acting crazy, bizarre, strange. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron2inrr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 acting crazy, bizarre, strange.</h2>
                    <p>OK, I wanted to post this just in case others are seeing strange behavior with Windows 10, beginning in roughly July &amp; August. &nbsp;I upgraded my desktop system last year (roughly Nov or Dec) from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;The upgrade went flawlessly and Windows
 10 worked equally flawlessly for maybe 6 months (I could not have been more pleased). &nbsp;As a side note, I also replaced my wife's 4-year old laptop with a new laptop with Windows 10 installed in Dec -- again it worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now (last couple of months, and her laptop also) I am experiencing some serious problems with Windows 10, some requiring a power off/on reboot of the system. &nbsp;It always comes back up rather quickly and works great for maybe a few days, maybe a week before
 strange things start happening. &nbsp;My recent problems were:</p>
<p>- some icons in task bar not responding to mouse clicks</p>
<p>- (task bar has 3-browsers, WLM mail, file explorer, Word, Excel, Google calendar &amp; few executing Apps)</p>
<p>- could load browsers (IE 11 or Edge), but they came up with an empty blue screen that just set there</p>
<p>- right-click on task bar to get Task Manager worked -- and everything there looked OK (no not-responding's)</p>
<p>- slowly/soon, the only icon on the task bar that would work/respond was File Explorer</p>
<p>- (could not even get the right-click to work (or multiple ctl-alt-del's) to bring up the Task Manager</p>
<p>- then the screen cleared when I clicked on Task View and would not come back</p>
<p>- couldn't get Contana or Windows Start Menu to come up (clicks on these guys ignored)</p>
<p>- clicked on a bunch of keys before power off/on reboot (and the escape key re-filed my screen with about 20 displays)</p>
<p>- began terminating every thing on the screen -- about 10-15 went away and then the Exit buttons quite responding</p>
<p>- a lot of Apps had been terminated, yet the little line in the task bar under the App icon did not go away</p>
<p>- eventually "nothing" would respond -- so I was once again reduced to a power off/on reboot</p>
<p>- machine came back normally (quickly in fact, probably less than a minute) and "everything looked and acted normally"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is that I have been experiencing a "much more than normal" system/App hangs where certain things "just quit working" -- many do not respond to the big Red Exit and I am forced to Task Manger "End" them. &nbsp;Often the problems are isolated to
 a few Apps and everything is acting pretty much normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[I will also mention that there is one Internet connection (investors.com) that "continually" screws up the browsers (IE11, Edge, Chrome) connected to it -- AND I MEAN REALLY SCREWS THEM UP - hangs, window won't even display (come to top) when clicked, not-responding,
 long script running errors, browser offers to Recover the session (which usually works), browser had to close and re-open the connection, etc., etc. &nbsp;I strongly suspect this connection, which I use all the time, is the reason behind some of my problems, but
 can browser problems like this spill over into other things in my system.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my "Can I do a Windows 10 Repair . . . . . ." post (don't know how to do the Link thing) for some similar behavior with my wife's Windows 10 laptop (NEVER used or has used investors.com). &nbsp;We are not aggressive Windows 10 users and have a minimum of
 Apps installed on our systems. &nbsp;I keep hoping it was a bad update that is causing my/our problems, but the problems do not seem to be diminishing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just posting this in case any others are seeing this strange or similar behavior -- and will keep updating it for awhile, when/if the strange things keep happening, in case I strike a nerve with someone. &nbsp;I am even considering a re-install of Windows 10
 since it initially worked so well, but as a last resort -- and I don't even know if I can do that since this was a free upgrade, which I think no longer exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. &nbsp;I typed this post up yesterday and got busy and did not send it -- but this morning, Edge refused to even respond to a Search request (in the Edge Find/Where to Next search window or in the address bar -- it just ignores the search text typed in and
 just clears the search request). &nbsp; I finally got it to respond (Search) when I closed a bunch of the Tabs (don't know which one brought it back to life). &nbsp;AND then I did a right-click on the Edge icon and brought up a new copy of Edge -- just to check if I
 got the wording on the "Find/Where to Next" phrasing above correctly -- closed it -- the did another right-click to bring a new copy up again -- and guess what -- it will not even respond to the right-click on the Edge icon now. &nbsp;AND again, once more, as I
 was typing this comment in, about 1-2 minutes after the Edge icon was not responding to a right-click, up pops my new copy of the Edge browser. &nbsp;LIKE I SAID, SOME VERY STRANGE HAPPENINGS, OPERATIONS OF MY WINDOWS 10 SYSTEM -- and finally, yes, I have run every
 security checkers at Microsoft I can find plus Malwarebytes -- don't trust a lot of the others -- none &nbsp;found anything funny in my system.</p>

            <p>OK - this is an Immediate Update after the above post - MORE BIZARRE BEHAVIOR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after the above post:</p>
<p>- went back to Edge and clicked on a Search link</p>
<p>- new window came up and Edge locked up</p>
<p>- cannot close the tab &amp; close browser gets me the "Close All Tabs?" popup</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(I reply Yes, and nothing happens)</p>
<p>- Other windows working, but right-click on task bar gets me nothing</p>
<p>- several CTL-ALT-DEL's gets nothing - and then about 20-30 seconds later, about 6 of them popup</p>
<p>- End'd Task Edge</p>
<p>- brought Edge back up - now it is not responding to Search requests</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(as before in the above post)</p>
<p>- brought up IE11 (already up from previous activity) and did a address bar Search</p>
<p>- search worked, but browser locked up when I clicked on a search link</p>
<p>- again, the Task Manager will not come up with right-click on the task bar</p>
<p>- left it alone and went to my Chrome browser (it also already up from previous activity)</p>
<p>- did a address bar Search, and it worked</p>
<p>- but when I clicked on a link, it also locked up</p>
<p>- only thing common here is something in Windows 10, isn't it</p>
<p>- again, had to do a CTL-ALT-DEL to get the Task Manager up</p>
<p>- AND while I was just looking at the Processes, the entire screen went black</p>
<p>- waited -- nothing -- had no choice but to do a power off/on reboot</p>
<p>- Windows cycled through the reboot father quickly</p>
<p>- BUT when the System came back up -- MY START-UP SCREEN HAD CHANGED</p>
<p>- My start-up screen had been the cave picture looking out onto the ocean for 10+ months</p>
<p>- SO WHY DID IT GET CHANGED NOW</p>
<p>- This is exactly one of the same complaints I had about my wife's laptop</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(See my "Can &nbsp;I do a Windows 10 Repair . . ." post (don't know how to do the link thing here))</p>
<p>- OK, Windows 10 is back up and is working good, normally (at least for a while)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is just another chapter in the bizarre behavior of Windows 10 I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried. &nbsp;I should be worried, shouldn't I.</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To resolve your issue, we recommend that you restore your computer from a system restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create
 a restore point manually</a><span>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>

<p>
</p><p>OK, thanks for the help -- and I have no Restore points -- I guess because System Protection was not turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never checked before because I thought that Restore points were automatically created every time the system was updated -- and I didn't realize that this was an option (I guess the Windows 7 -&gt; Windows 10 update came in with this option turned off/disabled
 -- so I guess I can't get help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with my wife's Windows 10 laptop that is also behaving strangely. &nbsp;I do remember checking it and finding no Restore points (See my Can I do a Windows 10 Repair . . . post) -- and got side-tracked and did not chase down the reason,
 but her system protection must also be disabled. &nbsp;So I guess we are out-of-luck for help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, let me ask a couple of more questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;I have a 1TB hard drive (20% used) - what is a normal/suggested size of the Restore area?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;Since a Backup Restore option is not available. can Windows 10 be reinstalled without affecting "anything" (current files, current Apps like Word, Excel, Photoshop Elements, WLM Mail, IE 11, Chrome, etc.). &nbsp;I think I remember when I went from Windows
 7 -&gt; Windows 10, all of that stuff was still there after the upgrade. &nbsp;this seems like a reasonable approach before considering what I think they call a Clean Windows 10 install.</p>

</p><p>Since the restore point is not available, we will not be able to restore the computer from its

<p>Moreover, we recommend to refresh your computer by following the steps below:</p>

</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> If you just recently installed Windows 10, you will be prompted that you cannot recover back to Windows 7/8.1.</span><span> All Apps you installed from the websites, DVD's, apps that came with your PC and apps that you installed
 from the Windows Store will be removed. Windows will show the list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC. All removed apps can be reinstalled from Windows Store or as long as you have the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>
</p><p>So you are saying that a Clean Install is just about the only option available to me at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let me ask about my upgrade from Windows 7 -&gt; Windows 10. &nbsp;If I remember correctly, I did that upgrade and I didn't lose anything -- i.e. not only did my data files survive intact, but I think/thought all of my Apps and everything else remained intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Am I mis-remembering</strong> -- which is why I was asking "why isn't there a similar option for a re-install of Windows 10".</p>
<p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you helped me out with the change in the Start Menu, but is the change in my Windows Start-up screen a result of one of the Windows 10 upgrades. &nbsp;I have been getting the "cave looking out to the ocean" start-up screen forever, so why did that get changed
 -- things like that bother me. &nbsp;I am looking for clear indications that something has changed in my Windows 10 system.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t save a file to removable disc</h2>
                    Running Windows 8.1. I&nbsp;&nbsp;want to save a Word file to a&nbsp;CD-R (Drive E)&nbsp;(the disc has several files on it, but is far from full). I go to 'save as' and save it to the drive, and now I have a window that shows the files already on the disc as well as "Files
 Ready To Be Written to the Disc". This the file I want to save. But there is no dialog box that allows me to actually&nbsp;write the file to Drive E. What do I do next? I also tried actually saving the file to the disc directly while in Word ("save as" and selecting
 Drive E), but when I try that a dialog box says, "You can't save here. Please choose another location." What am I missing?

            After 2 days and much gnashing of teeth, I finally figured it out. When you put the disc in the drive, you have the option of treating the disc as a CD/DVD or as a flash drive. I originally chose the former (silly me ... seemed obvious since it IS a DVD).
 I finally decided to try choosing option of saving&nbsp;the files as though the DVD was really a flash drive, and voila! It worked perfectly.

<h2>            One website won&#39;t load on any browsers unless I start the computer</h2>
                    I use one online banking website daily, and just after upgraded to Windows 8.1 I noticed that page can't load properly. It works only if the computer has been restarted, but it once I leave the page and try to go back it will give "This page can’t be displayed"
 message. I also tried Firefox, Chrome. It seems if one browser failed to load the site, then none of the browsers work. I then have to restart the computer to be able to open the website.
<br />
<br />
I also tried to delete and reset all browsers, clear cache, cookies, histories, log out and try a different user, malware scan, call the ISP, turn off Windows Defender, firewall, check "hosts" file, restart the modern, but they all failed. The only way to go
 back to the site is to restart the computer. If I am contentiously browsing the site, it works. the problem happens when I leave the page open without any activities for around 10 minutes, or close or leave the page, and the problem only appears to that particular
 site. <br />
<br />
So my last options are now leave a question here or contact the bank.<br />

            not working, tried both setting options. After restart, as described, I can open the website (www.anz.co.nz) using one of the browsers, then try to use IE, and Chrome, both failed. Firefox is working for now, but it is typical. eventually, it will fail
 too. It doesn't matter which browser to start with, same thing will happen. Also try to open website www.anz.com, Firefox is working at the moment. IE and Chrome failed.

<br />
Also, once the page loaded in private mode in Firefox it will sometimes load in normal mode, but not guaranteed.

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. I tried before posting here. it doesn't work either. I think it has to do with the how the information is stored in the cache and how the website is designed. It seems very strange that the website would not load after clearing the cache
 and cookies, but works after a reboot. I am not computer engineer, but I think some temporary information of the website can't be delete by clearing the cache or cookies without a reboot.
<br />
<br />
Also, I think the ANZ website is a bank website so it could also be how the website is designed for protecting users. I am just guessing here, when there is no activities for an amount of time from a certain IP address it might have placed some protections
 over its website and the redirection failed when the user try to use the site again.<br />
<br />
I am sure either Microsoft or ANZ will address the issue if the number of users who have the same problem increases. Of course, it also could be somewhere has gone wrong in my computer.<br />
<br />
Since I need to use the website daily I just can't reboot the computer all the time. There is no where else that I can seek for help without knowing exactly where the problem is. So I have restored my system back to Windows 8 for now and everything works fine.<br />

            Same symptoms. Neither ANZ New Zealand or Australia would load, but it loads if you perform a reboot.<br />
<br />
I also notice it takes a lot longer to load other sites that require log in, even just the help page of that website. Sometimes the "time out" site will appear, but if you keep refresh it will eventually load, just really slow.<br />
<br />
I have now restore the system back to Windows 8 and I haven't come across those issues. But I think it is still to early to say it is a Windows 8.1 issue, the website, or just the settings in the computer.<br />

            <p>Not sure if a related problem. but I also cannot access one specific website with my new laptop running Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried with IE 11 and also Chrome, but the site returns URL not found /404 messages.&nbsp; Yet, on my other laptop and desktop (both running
 XP), the website comes up fine- same residential wireless network for all three machines, so I assume it is a Windows 8 issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The website is <a href="http://www.themagicgadgetsite.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.themagicgadgetsite.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my own site, which sells&nbsp;magicians supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to find out why I cannot access it on this new laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone else open this site using Windows 8?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for any advice or help.</p>

            <p>I have the exact same issue. Cannot open anz.co.nz using Chrome or Explorer. It only has happened in the last few days I think, but it's not my regular bank so I don't use it all that often. But I don't think I have updated windows lately. I am running 8.1.
</p>
<p>I can open these from my work computer, and from other (non windows) devices on same home network.
