<h2>            If I add Korean Language to my computer, How can I switch between English and Korean&#63;</h2>
                    My wife is Korean and My computer is set up in english.&nbsp; Is there a simple way to select between the two languages and is there a problem when I download the language update?

            You can configure a user account for your wife in Korean, and another user account for you in English. Your computer must be running Windows Vista Ultimate or Windows Vista Enterprise, though. You can't install additional language packs in the other versions
 of Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you have Windows Vista Ultimate what you have to do is to go to Windows Update (<em>Start</em>,
<em>All Programs</em>, <em>Windows Update</em>) and,&nbsp;if your operating system validates as genuine, you will have the option to download the Korean language pack. Once you've downloaded the language pack, you have to install it:<br />
<br />
<strong>Install a display language</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Install-a-display-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Install-a-display-language</a><br />
<br />
Next, log into your wife's user account and change the user interface language to Korean:<br />
<br />
<strong>Change the display language</strong><br />

            <p>Because I searched for DAYS, I will add my comment. I had the same problem with my PCut CT1200 vinyl cutter, running through a COM port in Windows 7 fine, then disappeared when I upgraded to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the LXi VinylExpress software, and re-installed. I didn't use the driver on the CD with my old software, but had downloaded another copy so it was on my computer. I installed the downloaded driver in compatibility mode back to Windows 7, just
 as Sachin instructed, but wanted to add that my cutter didn't show up still, until I unplugged and re-plugged the USB from the cutter while it was on. As soon as I plugged the USB cable back in, the new COM port showed up in Device Manager, and finally I could
 run a test cut. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 phone companion not working with windows phone 7</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 phone companion locates my Windows 7 phone when plugged in via USB, it locates the more than 6 thousand photos and videos on the phone. Defaults to select all to import to c:/blah blah. Which on my first attempt I selected a different drive (one
 with ample space), but the import failed. The Windows 10 companion simply saying "something went wrong". And no options to investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second attempt, I let the phone companion use its default import location but received the&nbsp;same result: "something went wrong".</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so something went wrong...WHAT? And how do I get the photos off the old phone and onto my new PC, so I can then put them on OneDrive? The idea of selecting individual items one by one is NOT appealing, nor feasible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a file limit on what can be imported? Am I supposed to only import X number of photos at a time? Is importing a mix of photos and videos not possible?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions ThofikhAhamad, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When plugging in the phone with USB to either port on my pc there is no "Autp Play pop up".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to "This PC" the device is not listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to Hardware and Devices via the control panel (because search for Toubleshooting, view all did not work) I managed to dig up the Control Panel and an icon for it now lives on my task bar. Hardware and devices located the connected phone but lists it
 as a Media device. Troubleshooting says the USB Composite may not work with USB 3.0, please try a different 2.0 port. There are only 2 USB ports on my 2 in 1 Nextbook Tablet PC , but I switched ports anyway and received the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following through with troubleshooting it returns the message this device is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the icon in Hardware and Devices in and the pop up window says everything is working properly!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone Companion finds the device, as stated in my first plea for help, even assembles and selects the images and videos for import. But then returns: "Something went wrong" and fails to import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Phone Companion locates and displays and selects the images that are on the phone, obviously the USB ports and cabling are NOT an issue and are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a limit (file size, type or quantity) on what can be imported in one selection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More than 6 thousand images and 50 plus videos, it would be nice to import them in bulk not one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I should be able to manipulate the images from the device directly as simply a USB drive. I was able to do just that on my Android tabet connected to this PC. Why won't my two windows devices pay nice with eachother?</p>

<p>Again, I appreciate your response ThofikhAhamad but there is NOT an issue with the USB ports or controllers. The ISSUE, as I have managed to ddiscover myself, is that phone companion ha problems with importing combinations of videos and photos. As stated
 in my first and second requests for help, there are over 6 thousand image and video files on the phone. Apparently nobody at Microsoft thinks that people would want to import ALL of their images an videos at one time and furthermore they do not bother to specify
 that when the Phone Companion links to the device! </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone which is an old phone, but I have continued to keep charged just because I needed to port the image files to a better place, the images are in albums. Albums which I created according to photo content. NOT Dates!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who reviews their photos according to days of the year? Any normal human being will group photos according to subject. As a matter of fact I just may take several photos on the very same day of many different subjects - don't you? After I take the photo,
 it gets moved to a specific album based upon its subject. Like this: </p>
<p>January 1st lets say I took photos of a New Year party, and the dog, and the ferret, and my horse, and my friend. Then I will put each of those photo subjects in their respective albums such as: Dog photos, ferret photos, friend photos, party photos etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But NOoooo, Microsoft Phone Companion obliterated my Album heirarchy and grouped the photos according to date taken!</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO thank you very much Microsoft, you are now on the same level as Google Plus (they do the same thing with photos when uploading to google drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I finally, ON MY OWN, got Phone Companion to import my images and videos to my PC. However I now have to go through over 6000 images and reestablish a folder/album heirarchy according to photo subject matter!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of these photos were taken from my mobile service business of hoofcare for horses. Horses have 4 hooves, I took multiple images of each hoof on several different service dates! I serviced several different horses on the same day. There are several hundred
 horses on&nbsp; my roster. Can you even imagine the difficulty I now have to reestablish albums? No, I doubt you can. I don't think many people at Microsoft actually live in the real world or actually use their own products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to recap: Somebody needs to put a disclaimer or notice on Phone companion that there is a file size/type/ quantity limitation during import. They also need to revisit why Import images and videos works across the USB cable, but electing to use File explorer
 fails to even find the device.</p>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>Sorry, I failed to say that the HP w2408h is an HDMI monitor so of course it has HDMI in. &nbsp;Like I said, it also has One square USB IN and two USB OUT ports. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the wireless adapter uses the USB for Power?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I have two questions: (1) SHOULD it work with the w2408h (2) DOES it work with the w2408h, meaning has any one gotten it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it needs USB power. Not sure if your monitor will provide that. Also your monitor probably won't handle the audio transmitted over HDMI.

</p><p>The miracast adapter always have some small lag associated with it is not like realtime movements like hard wire...you may have some issues when moving the mouse or things like that. The adapter is more for presentation and to show some one the display.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Notice of Xbox Live enforcement action - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itsecman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notice of Xbox Live enforcement action</h2>
                    
<p>I have recieved an email notifying me of the above. Checking on the Enforcement website, I can see that this is against my sons account that details:-</p>
<p><span><b>Activity Detail :- </b>An activity feed item or comment created by this account was found to be inappropriate. This content may include harassment, profanity, sexual topics, hate speech, controversial religious topics, references to notorious people
 or organizations, sensitive current or historical events, or any content designed to sound like, look like, reference, or allude to these topics. The offending activity feed item or comment was removed.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
What I can't see is what he has done nor what the enforcement action is. There is no option for case review, so I can't find who to contact in order to understand what he has done nor what the punishment is. Obviously this is a concern to me and, as a parent,&nbsp;
 I need to understand what he has done so that I can decide if any additional punishment is appropriate.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Can someone please tell me who to contact to find out more?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would also like to understand what impact this has on my account as we share the xbox Live subscription.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Many Thanks<br />
</span></p>

<p>Your son has written something wrong on either one of his game clips or someone else's , to me it sounds like there is no case review because there is no case! It looks like its more of a warning and I don't think it will have any impact on your account.</p>
<p>You should ask your son what he wrote, you could explain you've had the e-mail and Microsoft are going to investigate the comments so it would be better if he told you first.</p>
<p>That's just my opinion of course good luck !</p>

<p>^^ The enforcement forums are not used anymore.They stooped using them in August last year.</p>
<p>You need to log in here <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enforcement.xbox.com/home</a> &nbsp;with the suspended account.</p>
<p>Mr Boozyhead has pretty much nailed it.They now send out warnings on some breaches of the ToU/CoC instead of taking action straight away but if it happens again your son could end up with quite a hefty punishment.</p>

<p>Hey TarrierCub57!</p>
<p>Use of profanity is a violation of the CoC for online interactions, this is most likely why you have received a warning and/or ban, you have not specified what, if any action was actually taken against you.</p>
<p>Just be a little more delicate with your choice of words in future and everything will be fine, when things are written they are much easier to see and record.</p>
<p>Even 'Sounds like or Looks like' profanity is a violation, therefore using "-" to replace one letter does not take away from the intended wording as you have used above.</p>
<p>I hope this helps for future reference :)</p>

<p>I think the best course of action you can take is to sit down with your son and ask him what he did, it looks like the offending item has been removed, so you cant really check, but that's the best thing to do.</p>
<p>Once your son tells you what he did, you can then explain to him why he shouldn't have done it.</p>

    <title>Audio Problem - Win 7 64Bit SP1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> open_dev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Problem - Win 7 64Bit SP1</h2>
                    I have dell vostro 1015, Core 2 Duo T6670, 2GB Ram. 64Bit Windows 7(Genuine no Cracks etc.). I Installs all the windows updates. The problem is with the Audio. Before it used to be that if I plugs in the Headphones, the windows automatically detects it
 and transfers all of my audio to that port, and when I used to remove it, the in-built speakers handled everything. But now this does not happen. It is constantly on the headphones or speakers, I have to manually "Set as default" the device I wish to use from
 the Control panel. Please help. I have installed the Dell audio driver from the Dell website and it sent no issue. Its really upsetting!<br />
<br />
Note: I am using Win 7 from quite a while, 1 and a half year almost on my this laptop. Never had this problem. Few months before had a virus, installed new copy of Windows. Now from 2 - 3 days I am facing this problem. I am using Original Eset NOD32 Smart Security.
 PC is completely clean now.<br />

            1) After installing Windows 7 - have you installed the newest audio drivers? If not download them from the manufacturers website, or if they don’t have any try Windows Update. Update driver for hardware that isn't working properly:<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly<br />
<br />
<br />
2) If you have external speakers - are they connected properly to the computer? If they need power are they plugged in? Are they turned on?<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Have you set the correct sound device? Click Start, type: sound. Then click Sound under Control Panel. Then set the default sound device.<br />
<br />
<br />
More options:<br />
<br />
4) Is the sound device disabled?<br />
<br />
A. Right-click the speaker icon on your taskbar<br />
<br />
B. Select "Playback Devices"<br />
<br />
C. In the white empty space right click and select both Show Disconnected/Disabled Devices<br />
<br />
D. Do you see icons for your sound device now?<br />
<br />
E. If you now see it you may need to right click on the correct sound device and select "Set as default device"<br />
<br />
<br />
5) You can also try the troubleshooter to find any connection issues:<br />
<br />
A. Click Start, then click Control Panel<br />
<br />
B. Type troubleshooting in the top right search field and select Troubleshooting<br />
<br />
C. Click Hardware and Sound, then select Playing Audio.<br />
<br />

            Hello Wanikiya, Thank U for your reply.<br />
<br />
1) I have installed the latest driver from Dell's official website. And things became more worse. Its now just outputting the audio to Headphone jack not to the built-in speakers.&nbsp; Whether the Jack is plugged in or not.<br />
<br />
2) Obviously bro.<br />
<br />
3) It is not showing any Disconected/Disabled devices; I had tried it before posting on the forum.<br />
<br />
And all other options, I have tried. But no luck Uninstalling the driver and letting windows do that is resolving the issue but not like the same as it used to be. I have to "Set as default" the device I wish to use. This was not the case before.<br />

            OK, here comes the bad news.<br />
<br />
Why did you install a 64bit OS ? There are no drivers at the Dell support website for that OS version. See<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/vostro-1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> here</a><br />
<br />
I suggest you back up any personal data you may want to keep to CD or DVD then format and install the 32 bit version of W7. You can then go to the above website and get the necessary 32 bit drivers, including those for audio.
<br />
<br />
Sorry but you won't ever have correct functionality using 32 bit drivers on a 64 bit machine.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Jerry<br />

            Brother thank you for your reply, But I have been using this laptop for around 1and 1/2 yrs now. And is using Windows 7 Prof(64Bit). Windows 7 automatically installs the drivers for it namely High Definition Audio. And if you go at dell's driver and downloads
 to download any driver and selects Win 7 32 bit. After that it gives you a bunch of drivers. The ugly and surprising thing is dell have such a bad bunch of webmasters. The drivers that we get are for 64 bit as well. See here:<br />
https://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/DriverFileFormats/Product/vostro-1015?DriverId=H05DN&amp;FileId=2731109649&amp;urlProductCode=False<br />
<br />
Go down and expand "Compatibility".<br />
<br />
Everything had been working fine but I don't get what has happened now. :S I will have to reinstall windows I think.<br />
<br />
Take Care.<br />

            Hello everybody, Just to add to help you people with things, I have CCleaner installed. Now what has been noticed is if I run a registry check it gives a bunch of COM Issues. After I have fixed them, the audio problem is resolved. But after few days the
 problem starts again. And if I run a registry check the things become fine again. :s what really is the issue! I don't get! Win 7 is irritating me a lot.

<h2>            Developer Mode and Backwards Compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hello guys.</p>
<p>I don`t know if this is the right place to post, but here we go:</p>
<p>1- The Xbox One Developer Mode runs only&nbsp;<strong>debug games (unsigned code)</strong>&nbsp;and not retail games?</p>
<p>2- Does the Xbox One uses the **** executable format (like 360)?</p>
<p>3- Since Xbox One has backwards compatibility through emulating the Xbox360,&nbsp;<strong>does XB1 runs unsigned **** files in Developer Mode?</strong></p>
<p>I am asking these questions, because i have a Custom Game Engine which develops 3D games for Xbox 360 (homebrew), it outputs a file default.****, which is unsigned, and only runs on a Xbox360 Devkit, and
<strong>i would like to play my homebrew xbox360 game on xbox one.</strong></p>
<p>Supposing that with developer mode xb1 can run unsigned code, i imagine that it could run also unsigned **** files from Xbox360.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>OEM partition causing problems with system imaging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff berg  say:</h3>
<h2>            OEM partition causing problems with system imaging</h2>
                    <p>I recently created an image of my system &amp; decided to test the image by restoring it to another laptop that is a similar model, but not identical to the original.&nbsp; The restored laptop had a 63 Mb UNALLOCATED space which I could not seem to eliminate.&nbsp; Later
 I came to realize that space should be the OEM partition which does exist on the original laptop.&nbsp; I am attempting to verify the image, but if the OEM partition is missing I do not have much confidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used MACRIUM REFLECT to create &amp; restore the image, but on multiple attempts could not image the OEM partition.&nbsp; I also attempted to use both EASEUS, ACRONIS, &amp; PARTITION WIZARD&nbsp;to label the OEM partition &amp; neither would do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included a screenshot of the original laptop configuration using both DISK MGR &amp; PARTITION WIZARD. Note that both do not indicate a file system for the OEM partition, and DISK MGR indicates an EISA configuration. I could not view the OEM partition
 using DISKPART in administrator mode, but could do so when I booted from a rescue DVD. DISKPART indicated that the partition was RAW &amp; the partition is hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should&nbsp;I convert the filesystem, assign a drive letter, &amp; reimage the computer to clear up the
 boot problem or will that ruin the original laptop? </p>

            <p>Well any OS installed to a pc along with its data,probably would not run</p>
<p>on another pc,unless its chipset were exact,repair,wont cut it..Either way,</p>
<p>in windows,to manipulate HDs,one would go to run,or cmd,type:</p>
<p>diskmgmt.msc&nbsp; in msc,the disk(s)/partitions,should be shown,click on Help-</p>
<p>tab,for services..Also,diskmgmt.msc is nice,but for other actions,open cmd,type:</p>
<p>DiskPart&nbsp; In DiskPart,list disk&nbsp; list volumes&nbsp; All on pc show with more details.</p>
<p>Also,disk,or HD imaging in xp is easy,it already has software built in,called:</p>
<p>XCOPY&nbsp; XCOPY can/will ghost entire data from one hd to another.</p>
<p>Also,a hidden partition from the oem,can be manipulated,one needs to run</p>
<p>recovery console (boot to xp installation cd),in recovery,type: DiskPart&nbsp; only</p>
<p>MS-DOS will let you remove hidden partitions</p>

            There are several ways -
<br /> 
<br />1. Press Print Screen key - This takes screenshot of entire computer. (ALT+Print Screen leaves out Taskbar)
<br />
<br />2. Use Snipping tool &gt; Type snipping in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click Snipping Tool &gt; Click New &gt; Choose area
<br />
<br />3. Use Onenote 2016 if installed &gt; Right click on Onenote icon &gt; Take screen clipping &gt; Choose area (I personally use this as Onenote nicely sits in my system tray)
<br />
<br />4. Word, Excel, Powerpoint &gt; Insert &gt; Screenshot
<br />
<br />After taking screen capture, paste it into any application say Paint, Word, Excel, Powerpoint.

            Hi Kathy, <br />2 easy ways. Press “ctrl+printscreen” keys - and then you can paste that into word, paint, etc. <br /><br />You could also click start and type “snipping tool” and use that to take snips/portions of the screen thay you desire. <br /><br />Let me know if this helps!<br />- C

<h2>            Mouse lagging a lot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been having this mouse lag issue for a while now and it's really really annoying especially when playing games.&nbsp; It will lag every 5-30secs and I have tried so many different things to fix it.<br />
<br />
I have tried....<br />
<br />
~Updating the drivers<br />
~Reinstalling the drivers<br />
~Taking the USB hub out and plugging it in with a USB extention<br />
~Updating the USB port drivers<br />
~Updating the GPU drivers<br />
~Updating Windows<br />
~Using a different mouse<br />
~Disabling permission for the system to turn off the device to save power<br />
~Disabling USB selective suspend setting in advanced power settings<br />
~Running extended Memtest - passed<br />
~Deactivate "Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them"<br />
~Stopping and Disabling Realtek HD Audio Manager<br />
~Disabling Cortana<br />
~Cannot find&nbsp;"ATI HotKey Poller" to deactivate that service in order to stop it (so I assume I don't have it)<br />
</p>
<p>I am out of ideas..<br />
<br />
<br />
My specs are...<br />
<br />
Operating system: Windows 10<br />
Motherboard: ASUS AM3+ TUF Sabertooth 990FX R3.0<br />
CPU: AMD Octa-core FX-9590 4.7GHz<br />

<p>
</p><p>I would love to try more troubleshooting methods</p>

            I believe you have tried almost all of them. I can recommend following additional troubleshooting steps
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt;  Click Hardware and Devices &gt; Click Run the troubleshooter and follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />

            I would recommend a repair upgrade of your Windows 10. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Before doing the reset last night, as it says to uninstall 3rd party antiviruses I did that step and restarted my computer and then the mouse was working fine now.<br />
<br />
So the problem was having 2 antiviruses on the computer.&nbsp; I forgot to uninstall my old antivirus after installing my new one!

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried different searches and unable to locate an answer to my scenario. I recently purchased an xbox one and still own a 360 as a media center. I would like to transfer my siblings (two non xbox live accounts) 360 profiles to my xbox one without a
 gold subscription (they don't play online).</p>

<p>I tried transferring via USB but that didnt work. any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
Basically I am running Vista 32-bit and wish to upgrade to Windows 7 64-bit.<br />
Using my student discount through 'digitalriver' I can pre-order it for the 22nd October and a link will be given to me on the day to download the OS.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I need a bootable install disk because I need to do a fresh install and I can't find anywhere what to do about that, microsoft have lots of FAQ's and such saying that a fresh install is required for certain upgrades but I have found no detail
 on how to do it with the electronic download, or if it's possible with the electronic download.<br />
<br />
Digitalriver offer what they call <strong>' Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit Disk Kit '<br />
</strong>Which has the description;<br />
<strong><strong>'</strong> Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit Disk Kit<br />
Suggested if you do not have a good broadband connection or would like to have a bootable CD available for future installation.'</strong>
<br />
<br />
So I believe that is what I want because I probably (knowing me) will do a re-install at a later date.<br />
With that I am confused because oh what happens when I add it to the basket.<br />
<br />
Title : <strong>Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit Disk Kit</strong> 
 <br />
Description : <strong>Microsoft® Office Ultimate 2007 Back-up DVD<br />
Suggested if you do not have a good broadband connection or would like to have the software available for future installation.</strong>
<br />
<br />
I am wondering wether it is a typing error by digital river because the Javascript calling the message (if thats the right term) is nearly the same except the message when its added calls a message 800 numbers greater (163936900) than it calls before we add
 it to the basket (163936900).<br />
<br />
So I am completely confused, from what support I have had from the Contact us section it just lead me to links I had already visited and read 100 times already.<br />
So taking the final piece advice from an response I am posting here in hope of a clear answer because I only have about £60 and cannot afford to waste money ordering the wrong item.<br />
<br />
So I hope you can help me, Thanks for taking the time to read the message.<br />

            You really need to call Digital River support about any technical difficulties you are experiencing when ordering the upgrade. If you chose to download the .ISO file which the Windows 7 Professional software will be provided as, you could use a tool such
 as ISO Recorder to burn it to a blank DVD so you can have a physical backup copy of the software:<br />

                    <p>I made a guest user account, (windows 10) and now the computer has a black screen with the pop up shell infrastructure host has stopped working. &nbsp;I can access task manager , however I am not logged on as an administrator. &nbsp;I accessed the task manager and
 CMD , however I do not have admin access. &nbsp;I phoned microsoft and chatted with someone there. &nbsp;They said I should get all my stuff off the computer, (see a tech), and then install windows 10 again. &nbsp;Really, over adding a guest user. &nbsp;I'm at a loss and was
 hoping there is another option. &nbsp;I should never have upgraded to windows 10. &nbsp;Any info would be grateful on how to fix this?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>PowerShell </strong>commands from the following steps in the guest user profile and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows <strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open an Administrator command window by</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right click </strong>on the taskbar and select <strong>
task manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on<strong> More details </strong>located at the bottom of the task manager window.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>File </strong>and select <strong>Run New Task</strong>. Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>CMD </strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 4: </strong>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 5: </strong>Check the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If not, <strong>restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new
<strong>Administrator user account</strong>. </p>
</li></ol>

            Hi RI.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 bricked after recovery attempt. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 bricked after recovery attempt.</h2>
                    So here's the situation, after a recent update my computer was really slow, touch screen was glitchy and type cover would stop working off and on. And I had an odd blue ring around the screen whenever I watched a video in full screen. I figured the update
 did it so I was going to just slick it back to factory and go from there. I used the utility to create a recovery drive and let it do its thing. It got as far as formatting the hard drive then errored out. Now every time I power it on it goes into the firmware
 settings, the only way to get it to power off is to reset it with the recovery thumb drive in the USB slot and using the power down button in the setup. Also every time I try and reinstall using the recovery drive it errors out. Thankfully I backed up all
 of my important stuff first. Its a brand new 16gb thumb drive I picked up just for this purpose so I doubt that's the problem but it could be. Unfortunately I am on deployment currently and away from my main PC so I cant really

<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>

<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>

<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>

<p><br />
Depends which Windows 7 version do you have.<br />
In order to change language to English, you need to install Language Packs.<br />
If you have Win 7 Ultimate or Enterprise, you can install the Language Packs.<br />
If you have Win 7 Pro, you can also install the language pack, but not through Windows Update as Ultimate does.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Home Premium or lower, you can't install language packs.</p>

To install English you need Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise.<br />
<br />
<br />
﻿Language Packs (or MUI - Multilingual User Interface) - Language packs provide a translated version of Windows dialog boxes, menu items, and help content. Switching to certain languages with a Language Pack, such as
 you can do an Anytime Upgrade to Ultimate.<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125894</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Type Anytime Upgrade in the Search programs and files box in the Start menu and click on the Windows Anytime Upgrade icon.&nbsp; From there, you can buy an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate. Then your can enter your Anytime Upgrade product key and perform a
 simple upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate so you can install a different language. All programs and files will stay on the computer. If you're unable to buy online in your area a local store may sell Anytime Upgrades, or you can buy the version of Windows 7 you
 want.<br />

<br />
<br />
</span><br />
1. Start -&gt; All Programs --&gt; Windows Update --&gt; Optional Updates. <br />
2. Open optional Updates and go to the section Windows 7 Language Packs. <br />
3. Tick the Multilingual User Interface (MUI) you want and click OK <br />
4. Proceed with Install Updates <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Go to Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Clock, Language, and Region / Change the display language
<br />
2. Switch the display language in the Choose a display language drop down menu. <br />
3. Click OK <br />
4. Restart for the changes to take effect (this will affect only the user profile under which you are currently logged on).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>If you have Win 7 Pro, you can also install the language pack, but not through Windows Update as Ultimate does.</blockquote>
<br />
You can not install Language Packs with Windows 7 Pro. Only with Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise.<br />

    <title>Schannel Error 36888 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> defiantclass1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Schannel Error 36888</h2>
                    I am getting this Schannel Error 36888 over and over and over again. There NOTHING listed on the help site about it. I have no idea what it is, but my computer is crashing over and over again. I don't know if this is the reason, but it seems to be the
 most frequent event listed in the event viewer. <br />
<br />
I restored my computer to the image I made after the initial installation back in July, and did this only after going back to restore points to 12/6/09.
<br />
<br />
It does not seem to be a Windows O/S issue or else these various restores would have fixed it. Nothing else has changed though. No new hardware added and any external devices I did have connected, I have disconnected to rule them out. All I have connected is
 one external hard drive (which I need for my backups) and the keyboard and mouse.<br />
<br />
The computer goes to a blue screen, usually after doing something like opening Windows Explorer or something like that. Just sitting idle, it doesn't seem to happen. Or at least not as often.
<br />
<br />
What is Schannel Error 36888. I found posting on different sites but none that are conclusive or tell me what EXCATLY to do about it.

            <p>Getting the same error.&nbsp; Just installed Trial Version of Outlook 2010 and noticed the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error occurs when I allow Outlook to set up e-mail accounts on its own.&nbsp; The first try is on a encrypted&nbsp;connection which fails, then the option to use an unencrypted&nbsp;connection succeeds.&nbsp; The error happens during the encrypted attempts and occurs 3
 times in succession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My POP3 server just uses a password, so it seems the attempts to use a encrypted protocol is involved.&nbsp; But maybe someone who understands more about how it works will know what type of scenarios might generate such an error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I notice if I let Outlook set up the accounts, it will succeed using the incorrect server name.&nbsp; Mine are
<strong>pop-server</strong> instead of just <strong>pop</strong>, but Outlook sets it up anyway.&nbsp; But e-mail access does not generate the error even using the wrong server name.</p>
