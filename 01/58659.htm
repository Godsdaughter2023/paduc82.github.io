    <title>Two Factor Authentication Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Two Factor Authentication Issue</h2>
                    <p>I'll start by saying this is a temp account I created specifically to ask this question on the forum.&nbsp; I recently switched mobile devices and I had the Microsoft Authenticator app set up with my actual account on the old phone.&nbsp; When i transferred data to
 the new phone, i didn't think about the fact i'd have to take special steps to transfer over the account to the app on the new phone until after the old phone was long gone (for reference, neither phone are Microsoft devices).&nbsp; This became an issue when i
 tried to reset the password on my actual email account that was previously tied to Microsoft authenticator, as it wants to sources of authentication to validate you are a real person.&nbsp; In my case, my sources were 2 email accounts i had (1 Microsoft email and
 one other) and the app itself.&nbsp; I could use my other email as a source of authentication, but both the app on my new phone AND the password reset on my Microsoft email account require 2 step Verification to work ...... and I only have one step..... the process
 keeps trying to send a random number to the Authenticator app that is theoretically tied to my old device (but has already been deleted).&nbsp; I also tried calling the Microsoft support hotline (he directed me to this forum) and tried the Microsoft account recovery
 procedure (after which I received an email stating that, since I had signed up for 2 Step Verification, they were basically going to ignore my account recovery request.... :(.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, TLDR -&nbsp; My only options now are to try random passwords until I finally remember the right one for my Microsoft email account, or hope for an as of now unforeseeable miracle to appear on this forum - any takers?</p>

            You gonna have to go back to technical support and speak with another agent. Whoever you spoke to was likely too green to handle issue. 
<br />
<br />I am currently going through a similar issue myself trying to log into my Office 365 portal, but unable to do so because it is sending a verification code to a number thats been disconnected and the alternatives are still text or call.
<br />
<br />So, I am going to have to speak to an agent to reset this.

<h2>            Display fuzzy&#47;blurry&#47; pixeled in some old system dialogs and programs like uTorrent after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    After updating to Windows 10 my display gets fuzzy/pixeled in some particular dialog boxes, all administrative tools console, programs like uTorrent. I have an 21.5" 1080p LED Display, GT610 Driver 353.62(Latest). I have 125% Display size. In Windows 8.1
 ifaced this problem earlier but changing scaling level to 125% to match display zooming solved the issue. But in Windows 10 nothing helps. I know that Disabling High DPI Scaling for particular app will solve the issue for that app but system dialogs does not
 get fixed. So I want a system wise general solution like that helped me in Windows 8.1. Thank You in Advance.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c387734-5fc5-40f5-961d-a51c622e0e5b" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22a79ac0-87d6-4ccc-82cd-d7fd69bee4c7" />

            <p>Having the same problem on my laptop (Dell XPS15 L502X). &nbsp;I found settings for ClearType and this has resolved any basic screen/ windows 10 dialogue blur - which wasn't much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the legacy dialogue boxes reached via the Windows 10 settings panel (such as advanced settings for anything) are still blurred - this I can just about put up with.
</p>
<p>But (and it is a big but) my Adobe CS5.5 programmes such as InDesign are blurred even when I select High Quality Display from within the programmes (not very helpful when trying to ensure the accuracy of something for web or print purposes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise love Windows 10 - so Microsoft please do a patch to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Search for application .exe in programmes <br />
right click and trouble shoot compatibility<br />
run through until Hi DPI settings get changed.<br />
Fixed!</p>

            This is a common problem on high definition displays using Windows 8.1 and 10. I'm trying to find the best fix, other than a registry edit or running a fix-it program. It's not an issue of corrupt files or bad drivers...&nbsp;

                    <p>Any Insiders here who got to mess around with the Groups feature? After a long back-to-back of Xbox releasing dashboard updates that'd undercut nearly everything I bought an Xbox for in the first place, this was a welcome addition. Now, ever since a patch
 replaced the dashboard's Entertainment tab with "Game Pass" (yuck), the Groups feature has been glitched to where my Groups disorganized themselves and can't be reorganized back to where they originally were— even after a restart, full-shutdown, network disconnect
 and a hard-reset (involving holding down the power button for ten seconds, disconnecting the power cable and leaving it out for up to a minute before reconnecting and booting the Xbox up again). Weirder still: Every time I try to move a Group to a different
 spot, I get an error pop-up message directing me to Xbox.com/ErrorCode along with a code (0x800c000c) that doesn't exist on the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other Insiders running into this issue? I came here because the Insider Hub's been directing me to this site for a while now.</p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

    <title>USB HDD driver&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenbombik  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB HDD driver&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Running HP ENVY 750-514 with Windows 10. Internal drive bays are full so am trying to use an external SATA 200Mb Samsung SP2004C drive connected through a USB 3.0 to SATA Hard Drive Adapter (drive has some old data I want to transfer).&nbsp; The drive is recognized
 in ControlPanelDevices but doesn't list in Windows Explorer, therefore it's not accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device properties list the device as SAMSUNG SP2004C SCSI Disk Device, and list driver details as using DISK.SYS, EhStorClass.sys, or partmgr.sys. But SCSI?? It's a SATA device??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another drive connected through USB is recognized as Seagate FreeAgent USB Device, and list driver details as using the same three files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone suggestions please? Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
<br />
You may need to get the correct drivers of your hard disk to make it accessible, kindly check the manufacturer's website/support for all the required drivers. You may also want to check your computer's manufacturer for instructions on how to detect the hard
 drive by changing the settings in the BIOS. <br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for other Windows concerns.<br />

<p>Ar Rom: Thanks for the reply but I found the driver(s) weren't the problem. Turns out that all I had to do is assign that drive a drive letter. Ta-Da...the drive now shows up in windows explorer. Perhaps others have had this trouble too.</p>

    <title>Speedlink Headset Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flamingnights  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speedlink Headset Adapter</h2>
                    
<p>I just got the Speedlink Headset Adapter which should allow me plug a headset with a 3,5mm plug into my xbox 360 controller. However, I don't hear any sound when plugging it in. Xbox Support told me they don't support guides anymore on how to get it to work.<br />
Also, my headset (Philips Citiscape SHL5205BK) has a built-in microphone, so there's no second cable for the microphone to plug in.<br />
Anyone know how to get it to work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will never hear game audio form that adapter. &nbsp;It only will let you use a normal PC headset like you would the default headset. No game audio comes through the controller only chat, party chat, and a couple system audio ques for party chat.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would need an Red and White Stereo RCA to 3.5mm adapter and get the audio from your 360 AV cable or from the stereo RCA output on your TV. Would then need a 3.5mm Y spliter to plug into the headset stereo cable into the chat adapter and get audio from the
 RCA to 3.5mm adapter. Complicated with wires everywhere.</p>

            Hi BarbaraJNM,<br />
<br />
An MFC application is an executable application for Windows that is based on the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. MFC applications fall into five types: standard Windows applications, dialog boxes, forms-based applications, Explorer-style applications,
 and Web browser–style applications.<br />
<br />
Firstly, we need to check which application is responsible for PML Service (PML service is a non-microsoft service). Based on my research, I came to know that the PML Service allows you to transfer a scan from the printer to the computer. So, it should be a
 Printer Service. <br />
<br />
Anyways, let us re-check. Right click on Taskbar and click on task manager.<br />
<br />
Go to the process tab, right click on PML service and click on Properties. Check out the description and the location in the proerties window. This should give you the Application name.<br />
<br />
Once you find out the application responsible for PML service, then uninstall the application from the Programs and Features Wizard in the Control Panel and restart the computer. Now check if you’re still receiving the error message.<br />
<br />
As an alternative, you can try putting the computer into a clean boot and check if you’re able to figure out what application is causing this error message. You can also check if you’re getting this error message by booting your computer in Safe mode.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135
</a><br />
<br />
Note: Once you figure out what application is causing the problem, then uninstall that application. Do not forget to put the computer back to the normal startup.<br />

            Hi Richard, after reading your article and subsequent references, I read that the Windows 8.1 Firewall may be blocking my ability to send and receive messages from my Outlook Account in Windows Live Mail 2012. I turned off the firewall and immediately
 was able to send and receive mail to my Outlook Account. when I turned the Firewall back on, it blocked the Outlook Account. Can you tell me what settings in the Firewall would be blocking the&nbsp; Outlook.com Account?

            I am using Internet Explorer. Please advise which settings in the Windows Firewall may be blocking access to Windows Outlook Account, as the Bigpond. com mail, which is POP3 will Receive &amp; Send, even though it does not retain the password. Microsoft is
 very lax on providing information on email options with Windows 8 &amp; 8.1. Sorry to be a&nbsp;problem but specific information should be available on this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I have tried all the suggestions, that I could find on the Forums. I have got to the point of reinstalling Live Mail 2012 &amp; recreating the Hotmail accounts, the email headers download, but I cannot open any of the emails, also I can not sign in to my Live
 Mail/Microsoft account in Live Mail. The drop down window shows, I put in my account &amp; password, then it just goes back to the inbox screen. I can log on without any trouble, through Internet Explorer &amp; Outlook.com, all emails show. On my main desktop, I am
 running windows 7 Pro., with Live Mail 2012 &amp; do not have any problem. I am convinced that this is a Windows 8.1 problem, as 8.1 will not let me establish my Microsoft account (Hotmail.com) as my Microsoft Account, gives an error message, try again later.
 I have done this and entered the Code sent to my mobile, but to no avail. Have tried a number of times &amp; the code does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can't be the only person having a problem of this nature, if so I should give&nbsp;up using computers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            In the MS Bluetooth pairing routine, how can I clear an existing, unknown passcode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on an HP 15-f039wm notebook, with Windows 8.1 x64.</p>
<p>I've upgraded it with an Intel AC 7260 WLAN card and a Bluetooth 3.0 keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AC 7260 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 combo WLAN adapter works well, both</p>
<p>on Wi-Fi and on BT.&nbsp; My cellphone connects, but the BT keyboard only pairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Bluetooth pairing routine apparently has a bad passcode for the keyboard already entered into it - by my mistake, no doubt.&nbsp; It won't accept "0000" or any other passcode I have tried, including the one printed on the UPC label.&nbsp; How do I remove
 the passcode stored in the notebook and start over?</p>

            <p>I accept Frank Boyne's explanation of how to add or delete a device using</p>
<p>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Audio &gt; Add a Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I thought I had added the keyboard by way of Bluetooth, it had not connected, and therefore, it was not on the Device list.&nbsp; I had to add it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Control Panel, the Add a Device scan found the Bluetooth 3.0 keyboard.&nbsp; Attempting to add it caused it to ask again for the passcode, which I didn't know.&nbsp; But this time, below the blank passcode query box, there was an option which allowed me to make
 changes to the keyboard properties.&nbsp; THIS OPTION DID PROVIDE A FRESH 8-DIGIT PASSCODE TO ENTER ON THE BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD.&nbsp; Now it is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Device list includes your keyboard, however misconfigured, you can delete it there and then add the device as explained above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are Frank Boyne's step-by-step instructions, which I have edited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;quote&gt;From the flyer, here are the instructions for pairing the keyboard... </p>
<ol>
<li><em>Press and hold the power button on the right hand side of the keyboard for ~3 seconds [or press "Connect"] until the blue LED starts to flash slowly.&nbsp; It may alternate two flashes and a pause.</em>
</li><li><em>On the Start Menu, click</em><em> "Control Panel."</em> </li><li><em>Under "Hardware and Audio," click "Add a Device."</em> </li><li><em>As the Device scan proceeds, the Bluetooth keyboard should appear in the device list.</em>
</li><li><em>Select the keyboard.&nbsp; You should be presented with a passcode.<br />
If not, click the link below the empty passcode query box for a new passcode.</em>
</li><li><em>Type that passcode on the Bluetooth keyboard and press Enter.</em> </li><li><em>Your keyboard is now ready for use.</em> </li></ol>
<p>The flyer also emphasizes that, when turning the keyboard off and on, you should press the power button for only ~2 seconds until the blue LED comes on [or press "Connect"].&nbsp;&nbsp; Release the power button immediately after the LED comes on, or else the keyboard
 may end up&nbsp;back in pairing mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also a troubleshooting section in the flyer...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you have previously paired your Windows system with the keyboard, but it does not seem to function, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue (you can also refer to the release notes for any further issues you may encounter).</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>First check the keyboard batteries and make sure they are fresh [or the internal battery is charged].</em>
</li><li><em>If the batteries are good, go to the "Add a Device" routine:&nbsp; from the Start menu, click Control Panel, and under Hardware and Audio you can find "Add a Device."</em>
</li><li><em>Select the Bluetooth keyboard from the list of Devices which the Device scan finds.</em>
</li><li><em>Select "Remove Device" (or perhaps press "Delete")..</em> </li><li><em>Click "Yes" to remove the device.&nbsp; The Bluetooth keyboard will disappear from the list.</em>
</li><li><em>Follow the steps in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Discovering and associating the keyboard with Windows</span> section above to reconnect your Bluetooth keyboard.</em>
</li></ol>

            Hi there Rohit, could you try the following fixes for me?
<br />Method 1:
<br />
<br />Use the DISM tool and System File Checker for repairing any missing or corrupted system files:
<br />
<br />1.      Click Start.
<br />
<br />2.      Type cmd, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to open elevated command prompt (I.e. Command prompt with admin rights).
<br />
<br />3.      If the User Account Control dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click Continue.
<br />
<br />4.      Type or copy paste the below command lines into it:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. Reboot your system to see if problem still occurs.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Perform Clean Boot.
<br />
<br />Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in clean boot state.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X key. And select Run.
<br />Type msconfig in the Run box and hit Enter.
<br />On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then tap or click Disable all.
<br />On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open Task Manager.
<br />On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click Disable.
<br />Close Task Manager.
<br />On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click OK, and then restart the computer.       
        </p>

    <title>How to determine if a exe was installed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to determine if a exe was installed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Gurus:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have Windows 7 and Norton Anti-Virus/Firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came across a strange popup message when I logged into my Computer today. A popup window said that "Do you want to install &lt;path&gt;\SYSWOW\MAClean.exe (not sure about the path or the exe name)?" While I was researching on it using another Computer, it
 disappeared. What is causing concern is that I do not find any exe with MA*.exe in the Computer. My Computer also seems to be hanging while logging - it logs in normally - no delays - if I remove the Wireless connection; other times, it logs in okay, even
 with the wireless connection is ON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:-</p>
<p>1) How can I determine whether an EXE was installed (I do not see any installations in the Uninstall or Change Program" window in Control Panel)?</p>
<p>2) Is there a way to list out all the "Alerts" or "Popup" messages that appears on the screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>San</p>

            <p>Hello San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may occur if the corresponding .exe file is associated&nbsp;with some program installed on your computer. To check the instance of the file, you can check in the list of Programs and Features&nbsp;in the Control Panel. Apart from that, it may be caused due to
 a virus infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know about the various pop-up alerts and notifications, you may open the Action Center in Windows and check for any important notifications or tasks, Windows needs to accomplish. To do so, you may refer to the following path:
<strong>Start &gt; Control Panel </strong><em>(view by:&nbsp; Large icons)</em><strong> &gt; Action Center</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may also check for any error messages in the Event viewer for more information.</p>
<p>(Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong><em>Event viewer</em></strong> in the Start search and hit ENTER.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for the third party program/service giving the pop-ups/alerts, you may start the computer in a selective startup with no third party software in operation. This process is known as
<em>Clean Boot</em>.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, if your computer hangs or freezes often, I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link.</p>

<p>I've had the same exact problem as described in my Toshiba Laptop and removing the FAT SD card as suggested solved the problem for me.</p>

For example, 14393.1066.</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Just to confirm, when you mentioned "touchtone", did you mean your device used to produce a sound whenever the screen was touched? Did you make any changes to your device before this started happening?</li><li>Did you get any error messages? If yes, please post a screenshot.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>

<h2>            Right-Click Contextual Menu No Longer Works</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a "<em>Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-Bit</em>" operating system installation that has originated from an upgrade from a "<em>Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit</em>" operating system installation. The upgrade has taken place on the fated date of July 29th,
 2015, that is, four (4) months and nine (9) days ago.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Right-clicking on the "<em>Microsoft</em>" logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen produces a contextual menu. Somehow, a few days ago I have noticed that it is impossible any more to start any commands from that contextual menu. The only commands
 that are still working appear to be "<em>Search</em>", "<em>Run</em>", and "<em>Desktop</em>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The "<em>Start Menu</em>", as it has originated in the "<em>Microsoft Windows 95</em>" operating system version, is nowadays too intricate for a simple and innocent mind. However, that right-click contextual menu was a gem and its use greatly enhances the
 efficiency of operating the personal computer system.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Please advise on what to attempt in order to revive its commands that are no longer working. For instance, let us take the case of the "<em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em>" command that is currently no longer working.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Best regards,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Varada Prada,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bucharest, Romania,<br />

<br />
It could be a Startup or Shell issue.<br />
<br />
Check&nbsp;Startup Programs.<br />
<br />
Right Click in the lower&nbsp;left hand corner - Task Manager<br />
Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager<br />
Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Check the StartUp tab.<br />

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Joy Kemprai.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for responding so promptly to my question.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before asking my question, I had already checked the second (2nd) method on your answer by myself. The "<em>scf /scannow</em>" command did produce some results. At least, it restored some links in the "<em>Start Menu</em>". However, the overall effect was
 not the expected one. The issue still persisted.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As regarding your first (1st) method on your answer, there is one problem related to its first (1st) point. The issue itself prevents such selection of the "<em>Task Manager</em>" software application. Still, I was very lucky, as the "<em>Task Manager</em>"
 software application was already executing. However, after executing the "<em>Microsoft PowerShell</em>" command line that you have instructed me to, the issue still persists.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Rob Brown.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for answering so fast to my question, too. It is overwhelming to see so swift and dense support, all at a time. I also love Mark Twain. He had a very clear view upon life. I have recently read his "<em>Prince and the Pauper</em>".</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; My "<em>StartUp</em>" Tab of the "<em>Microsoft Windows Task Manager</em>" software application is empty. However, I have a problem with a notification that always pops up telling me that I have more than three (3) software applications that start upon
 the system start-up. I have disabled that notification recently. I have described the situation at the following Uniform Resource Locator:

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for listing the utility software applications. It seems that the Contextual Menu has a long history within the Microsoft Corporation. I shall check them all. Hopefully, they will also help other people who might want to troubleshoot their personal
 computers.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Use Autoruns to see more startup programs (there are more than the one default<br />
location). You can try a Clean Boot to see if it is a StartUp program.<br />
<br />
If mot a StartUp it is probably a Shell issue.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Rob Brown.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have installed Mark Russinovich's "<em>Autoruns</em>" software application and it is indeed excellent! Many thanks to him and to his whole Klan! I have been using his "<em>Autoruns for Windows v 13.5</em>" version that is detailed at the following Uniform
 Resource Locator:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Autorun's Uniform Resource Locator">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is difficult to say which startup entry's disabling has fixed the issue. I have disabled almost anything that went through my head at the moment of the "<em>Autoruns</em>" software application's usage, excluding the grey matter. And, even before the
 reboot, the "<em>Start Button</em>"'s "<em>Context Menu</em>" had been revived! Moreover, after the machine's reboot, the operating system is still working! Wow!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I did not have to redo a clean boot in order to fix this issue. Again, I do not know who was the scapegoat software application that was messing up the whole landscape. However, I did remove a bunch of "<em>Context Menu</em>" options related to the "<em>Files
 and Folders</em>". I have left only the seemingly useful "<em>Context Menu</em>" entries.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not a clean install of the "<em>Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-Bit</em>" operating system. I have tried all the methods in order to remember when the previous "<em>Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit</em>" operating system had been installed, before the
 fated date of July 29th, 2015, when the upgrade had been performed. The "<em>C:\Users</em>" Folder looks that it had been created on "‎<em>Friday, ‎10 ‎July ‎2015, ‏‎12:05:28 PM</em>". This might be the previous installation date, but I am not sure about that.
 The methods to find out when this Creation has been started are detailed at the following Uniform Resource Locator:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.askvg.com/tip-how-to-find-out-the-date-and-time-when-windows-was-installed-in-your-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="The Tip's Uniform Resource Locator">http://www.askvg.com/tip-how-to-find-out-the-date-and-time-when-windows-was-installed-in-your-computer/</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the meantime, something must have come up and it must have messed up the whole installation. Anyway, now the "<em>Start Button</em>"'s "<em>Context Menu</em>" is again working, so the issue has been solved.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have also re-enabled the "<em>Control Panel \ All Control Panel Items \ Security and Maintenance \ Maintenance \ Disable apps to help improve performance</em>" option in order to check if the erroneous notification is still manifesting. It has not shown
 up again, yet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, the "<em>Task Manager</em>"'s "<em>Startup</em>" tab has always been completely empty. Nothing has ever been there.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks, Rob! Again, I love Mark Twain and his literary works. I consider "<em>Huckleberry Finn</em>" one of the best novels of the worldwide literature. I have relatively recently seen a German screening of this novel. It sounds funny to hear Huck speaking
 German, but still, we are all global today, are not we?<br />
<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; Bucharest, Romania,<br />

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Update:</strong> Unfortunately, the notification has just re-manifested itself again. I had to re-disable it. The "<em>Startup</em>" tab of the "<em>Task Manager</em>" software application continues to remain empty.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If it is a Startup program then it is a process of elimination. And sometimes</p>
<p>such an issue can be caused by the interaction of two or even more startup<br />
programs. 3rd party antivirus/security programs are always suspect. Use<br />
Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
Glad to have helped. Sounds like you did some very good troubleshooting!<br />

            <p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Rob Brown.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; One has to know when to rejoice. The haste is never a good idea.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was so happy that the "<em>Context Menu</em>" of the "<em>Start Button</em>" was again functional. Then, I had the idea to manually start the "<em>SurDoc</em>", "<em>Google Drive</em>" and "<em>OneDrive</em>" software applications. Nowadays, there is
 a fashion for the "<em>Cloud</em>" area of software applications.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After this action, I have discovered that the "<em>Context Menu</em>" of the "<em>Start Button</em>" does not work any longer, again. This might mean that one of those three software applications is messing up the whole picture.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, there is some history to this installation of the operating system and its associated software applications. The "<em>Asus</em>" "<em>X551-MA</em>" "<em>Quad Core Intel</em>" laptop has been purchased back on the date of September 26th, 2014. Some
 time after that date, unfortunately separately - instead of buying an "<em>Original Equipment Manufacturer</em>" license together with the newly bought laptop - the "<em>Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit</em>" operating system has been bought.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since then, the operating system has never been reinstalled. Microsoft is now recommending the "<em>Reset</em>" and "<em>Refresh</em>" actions. I have never used the "<em>Reset</em>" action, but I have used the "<em>Refresh</em>" action a few times, as
 the operating system has suspiciously failed a few times, for unknown reasons. The "<em>Refresh</em>" action is supposed to preserve the documents and even some settings. This preservation must have also kept some wrong things that would have been better wiped
 out through a thorough "<em>Reset</em>" action.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The "<em>Refresh</em>" actions might explain why the "<em>C:\Users</em>" folder has a creation date of July 10th, 2015. That might be the date of the latest "<em>Refresh</em>" action. That folder has surely been created much earlier than that, but somehow
 the "<em>Refresh</em>" action must know how to retouch the creation date of that folder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; To top all this, after nineteen (19) more days, the fated date of July 29th, 2015 has come, as one cannot stop the unstoppable. The "<em>Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-Bit</em>" operating system upgrade has been manually installed, using an executable binary
 file downloaded from the Internet, as the automatic update has naturally failed on that date. After that date, the operating system has been behaving strangely and I am getting tired of fixing and re-fixing it again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upgrading is not always a good idea. I simply cannot remember how the "<em>Microsoft Windows 3.1 16-Bit</em>" operating system was looking before the year of 1995 and I do not want to search the Internet for any old images. I still remember, however, the
 launch of the "<em>Microsoft Windows 95 16-Bit</em>" operating system and its newly introduced "<em>Start Button</em>". It was even accompanied by one great song sung by Mick Jagger and called as "<em>Start Me Up</em>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since then, twenty (20) years have passed and subsequent updates have been applied to the operating system. Frankly, I do not see much change in the way the operating system can be troubleshot or debugged. Nowadays, I do not trust much either the "<em>Reset</em>",
 or the "<em>Refresh</em>" actions, as it is simply much better to wipe everything and to restart on a clean slate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is increasingly more difficult to restart everything all over again, when the amount of data is of at least a half of a Tera-Byte of data. Even if the documents are backed up somewhere, the amount of settings is huge and it is difficult both to store
 them somewhere and to reproduce them after a clean restart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, if I ever attempt to solve this problem again, I shall surely have to perform it the American way. I remember a motion picture featuring Kevin Costner. It was a western. The guy entered a saloon. The bartender showed him a sign stating that no guns
 were allowed inside the bar. The guy aimed his rifle at the sign and shot it. Afterwards, he patiently affirmed: "<em>Look, now there is no sign</em>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before attempting to approach such a solution myself, I might still want to back some data up somewhere. I still do not know any good backup solutions. I have not found an Internet On-line Storage Solution yet where I might store a half of a Tera-Byte of
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; This would change the topic of this thread toward the issues related to the On-line or Off-line Backup Solutions. I guess that there is no standard and simple way for either of them. For the moment, I guess that tedious Troubleshooting and Debugging must
 replace those Solutions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, it is surprising that I have received so much support for the "<em>Microsoft Windows</em>" operating system, for free and so easy. My recent experience with the support obtained for the "<em>Canonical Ubuntu</em>" operating system has been rather
 difficult and extremely laconic, which is beginning to destroy the myth that Microsoft is not an open company.<br />

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Rob Brown.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As you may remember, there were three (3) software applications that looked suspicious and that appeared to threaten the normal functioning of the "<em>context menu</em>" of the "<em>start button</em>" of the "<em>Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-Bit</em>"
 flavor of the operating system: "<em>SurDoc</em>", "<em>Google Drive</em>", and "<em>Microsoft OneDrive</em>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, I have decided to rerun the "<em>Autoruns</em>" software application and I have removed again everything that went through my head, except the silence between the thoughts. I did not find anything related either to the "<em>Google Drive</em>",
 or to the "<em>Microsoft OneDrive</em>" software applications.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; This might mean that the culprit could be the "<em>SurDoc</em>" software application. What to do now?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; These might be the possible solutions for this situation:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Wait until the "<em>Microsoft Corporation</em>" buys the whole planet of the software industry and fixes everything. As things are going nowadays, this solution might not imply a lot of waiting time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Remove and forget about the "<em>SurDoc</em>" software application. Reporting this issue to its developers might involve another waiting time, which could be endless.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Use the "<em>Autoruns</em>" software application from time to time, in order to fix this issue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As things are going nowadays, I am inclined to use the third (3rd) solution.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have retained another good piece of advice from you, related to the usage of the Dutch "<em>Anti-Virus Guard</em>" software application that I have downloaded and that I have installed from its subsidiary located somewhere within the Czech Republic, South-Eastern
 Europe. This fine piece of software application could also mess up some things, even beyond my mere human understanding. Also, you were suggesting to use the "<em>Microsoft Windows Defender</em>" software application instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, no matter how much I have tried to completely remove the Dutch "<em>Anti-Virus Guard</em>" software application, using all its recommended removal software utility applications, I am not completely sure that I have eventually succeeded in doing
 so. Moreover, any attempt to start the two (2) services related to the "<em>Microsoft Windows Defender</em>" software application have failed. I have eventually ended up on a seven (7)-page support thread that was once even suggesting "<em>to Reset or to Refresh</em>"
 the "<em>Microsoft Windows</em>" operating system, actions that I am attempting to avoid, as nothing good has come out of either of them, so far.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consequently, I have decided to reinstall the Dutch "<em>Anti-Virus Guard</em>" software application and to wait until the "<em>Microsoft Corporation</em>" conquers and fixes the whole world of the software industry. It should not take too much of our time.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; Just in order to clarify out some things, the "<em>contextual menu</em>" of the "<em>start button</em>" is now working. I have just proudly started the "<em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em>" option using it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is the issue, if there still is any issue, anywhere, any longer?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The issue does not belong to the "<em>Microsoft Corporation</em>", or at least it does belong to it, after the interaction with the "<em>SurDoc Desktop Download</em>" software application. Whenever I start this "<em>SurDoc Desktop Download</em>" software
 application, the "<em>contextual menu</em>" of the "<em>start button</em>" does not work any longer. Its only options that are still working seem to be "<em>Search</em>", "<em>Run</em>", and "<em>Desktop</em>". Maybe also the "<em>Shut down or sign out</em>"
 sub-menu is still working, but I have not tried its sub-options yet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Rob Brown has wisely suggested already, I can use the "<em>Autoruns</em>" utility software application in order to remove any entries related to the "<em>SurDoc Desktop Download</em>" software application that might affect the "<em>shell extensions</em>"
 or the "<em>software applications that are executed upon the system start-up</em>". Whenever I do that, the "<em>contextual menu</em>" of the "<em>start button</em>" starts working again. After I manually start the "<em>SurDoc Desktop Download</em>" software
 application, it is again crashing somehow the normal functioning of the "<em>contextual menu</em>" of the "<em>start button</em>". It is very simple. I hope it is all clear now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no need to copy anything from anywhere. I have not modified anything manually. Just for clarification, this is the contents of the before-mentioned folder:<br />
