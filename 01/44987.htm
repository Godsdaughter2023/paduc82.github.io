<h2>            Will my System Mechanic work with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have System Mechanic 14.5 installed on my Dell OptiPlex and my Dell Dimension. This support program has some deep running apps involved with it. Will it convert to and run with Windows 10 without any problems? Also, I can backup my data in case there
 are any losses during the upgrade but how do I backup my programs and apps against any unforeseen losses?

            <p>I have no problem with it. It seems to work out fine. Please note: The Optimize System Drive...take a while, I don't know why, but I believe it's, cleaning up the junk left behind.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran this before downloading windows 10, it ran 5 mins. now it's running 30-40 mins.</p>

    <title>User folder name truncated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amacabama  say:</h3>
<h2>            User folder name truncated</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 from an iso as a completely new installation. My user name is my Microsoft account name
andrew@mydomainname but the folder set up in User has been truncated to five characters, so that Documents is at C:\Users\Andre\Documents and not at C:\Users\Andrew\Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have Documents at a different location on my Surface to my desktop, which&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;hard to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that reinstalling and using a local account name before connecting my account to my Microsoft account name would probably correct this, but is non trivial and would take a day to implement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can change the location of my User folder to what I consider to be the correct place?</p>
<p>

<p>or possibly andre</p>

            <p>I found I had to do a reinstall anyway so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I reinstalled using a local account in my name</p>
<p>2. I ran the mail app which converts the local account into a MS account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now okay. Drastic but effective.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hijack this thread, it was the only one I could see with a similar situation,&nbsp;but I have just reinstalled Windows 10 as a fresh install and noticed this when the batch files I had written to move my files back failed. It has created a user folder
 of only 5 characters. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be reporting this as a bug&nbsp;on the Feedback tool as it should&nbsp;not be doing this as it can cope with longer usernames if a local&nbsp;account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the reinstall, using a local account then converting it to a Microsoft account, which&nbsp;is not ideal as I believe it doesn't fully convert the account, is there any other solution?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will cause problems syncing files between two computers and confusion if two people with similar names share a PC. I think this is a mistake on Microsoft's part.</p>

            <p>This is an&nbsp;aggravating bug that's just plain&nbsp;disrespectful to people.&nbsp; It is unprofessional&nbsp;and rude to address another person whom you are not familiar with, not using their proper name. Whatever motivation Microsoft might have had was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is like saying, sure, I will store your files, whomever you, are in a folder you can't change, and I don't really give a rat's &amp;^% where I put them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your company has billions and billions of Dollars, and this is the best you all could do? Where does the money go? What do you all spend it on? Or did someone actually think, and I use that term loosely, actually think that this was helpful, or a feature,
 that someone might actually want their name truncated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, the screen fading effects during the install worked. Somehow you even managed to remove the way of fixing it. Somehow you managed to turn Windows 10 into the biggest piece of spyware, I have ever seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet, a PERSON'S name, a HUMAN BEING's name just didn't seem to get the same attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How much could you really about the user's feelings, the customer's feelings?</p>

            <p>I agree with the last comment. Windows 10 is a dud and intrusive with so much automated assumptions that it is unusable.&nbsp; Microsoft should have a fix for this which does not involve fiddling with the registry.&nbsp; I thought that the reply from the &nbsp;Microsoft
 software engineer offensive.</p>

            <p>This is a most frustrating issue. I have completed several dozen Windows 10 clean installations and every time in the User directory my users-name directory name is truncated to 5 letters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is interesting that with all sorts of techie issues outstanding in the teething years of Windows 10 this particular one brings out the worst in me and I think particularly nasty thoughts about Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware - Microsoft - this particular bug is a personal swipe at your users. Yes - for better or worse we are now allowed to identify our own gender, ethnicity, political stance - but our names - now that's Microsoft's business. Get real - sort this out please.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Very aggravating. To what purpose? To what benefit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please enable renaming the folder to the actual user name selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this is no bug. I feel confident this was a strategic decision to move folks off of long paths and folder names to "Quick access" and "This PC" via the explorer. It migrates you away from the hierarchical folder paradigm.</p>

<h2>            TrustedInstaller.exe Continuous Memory Consumption</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I’m having an odd issue with TrustedInstaller.exe on Windows 2008 R2, and no it is not runaway CPU usage.&nbsp; TrustedInstaller.exe runs continuously and steadily uses more memory.&nbsp;
 I have let it run for 3 days straight hoping it would work through its issue, but I ended up stopping the process after it hit 700mb.&nbsp; It started the day after installing .Net 4.5.2, rebooting and then installing the May Rollup for .Net KB4019112 and rebooting.&nbsp;
 I have another Win 2008 R2, which did not have this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>When I look at the Instance in Process Explorer, there are 100+ unnamed Event Handles, several EtwRegistration
 Handels and several TpWorkerFactory Handels, if any of that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>I am able to run other windows installs, so it is still doing its job, just not letting go of memory.</span></p>
<p><span>I have ran SFC and it found no issues.</span></p>
<p><span>I have noticed though that there are 2k+ files in winsxs\Temp\PendingRenames dated from later in the day when this started.</span></p>
<p><span>Any help or guidance would be appreciated.</span></p>

<h3> jeff_parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            SMS in Skype for Windows doesn&#39;t sync all the time</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Skype on my Lumia 950 set as the default SMS app, and also have the phone connected to Skype running on my Windows 10 desktop PC and a Surface Pro&nbsp;- all three devices with the same version of Skype, viz. 11.19.820.0. I prefer to use my phone's
 network to send SMSs and not via Skype, as I have no cap on SMSs on my phone's plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference for this is because I like to have all of my messaging history for my contacts available in the same thread (i.e. unified) as there are times when we might use Skype and other times SMSs, depending on where each of us are, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm finding is that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) There are times when I send an SMS from my phone and it does not show in the conversations history on one or both PCs.</p>
<p>b) There are many historical time periods (in one case about 3 months) where SMSs are not included in Skype, but do appear still in the Messaging app on my phone.</p>
<p>c) There are times when I send an SMS from one of the PCs, selecting the correct mobile phone number for the recipient, and it doesn't actually arrive, even though Skype says it has been sent; and times when it does arrive, but does not sync to Skype on
 my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main person that I wish to have the messages unified has changed their mobile number a few times over the years, and I keep their old numbers on their People app profile, in the hope that all of the backed up SMSs will remain linked to their profile
 and hence downloaded. This seems to work OK, but there are still gaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make Skype do a refresh download of all conversations, including backed up SMSs?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Jeff_Parker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret to inform you, Skype on Windows phones does not have an option to refresh chat history, so that it'll load all the previous and current conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are gaps on the messages history, please be informed that the messages can be viewed for a certain period of time only. If the messages are past 30 days, it will be saved on your hard drive and only current messages will appear on your chat messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you wanted to use your phone's native SMS feature, just log out your account in Skype to disable Skype's SMS, here's how:</p>
<p>1. Tap the Messaging tile on your phone.</p>
<p>2. Tap the<strong> ellipsis ('…')</strong> near the bottom right corner to bring up the menu and choose
<strong>Skype settings</strong> .<br />
3. Below your profile information you should see text that says <strong>Sign out.</strong> 4. Tap it and choose the
<strong>Sign out </strong>button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

<p>Karen,</p>
<p>I have a similar problem, but it is maybe even more straightforward; I am using Skype exclusively across my Windows 10 phone, and two Windows 10 PC's.&nbsp; The SMS messages are not syncing.&nbsp; The computer I am using to write this does not have the threads of
 several SMS messages from earlier this week, although they are clearly present on my phone.&nbsp; Is this a settings issue or a system flaw?&nbsp; I don't want to give up on Skype as my SMS platform just yet, as I like the concept, but I am loosing messages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm not sure this is comprehensively responsive to the question.<br />
<br />
You have established that there is no way to refresh chat history, and I understand that (even though disabling and reenabling the feature on a PC and a paired Windows phone seems to do precisely that with some aberrations).<br />
<br />
Let's review some of the additional use-cases in the OP that your response doesn't seem to touch on:<br />
<br />
"a) There are times when I send an SMS from my phone and it does not show in the conversations history on one or both PCs."<br />
<br />
In my case, I'm only using one PC and one Windows Phone, and in that environment, there are times where messages received via SMS are not displayed in Skype. Can you address the reasons for this behavior? To be clear, the Setting in Skype is referred to as
 "SMS backup and sync"; I understand "backup" and "sync" to have very specific meanings. Perhaps you can clear that up by telling us what Microsoft believes the words "backup" and "sync" mean. Presuming that "backup" means backup and "sync" means sync, can
 you explain why the application seems not to consistently backup or sync?<br />

<p>Thanks for adding to and supporting this issue jojunk31. I must say I was quite disheartened by Karen_E's reply to my post, which completely misses the point and is unhelpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The designed-in restriction of only 30 days of messages being in the cloud and the others being stored&nbsp;on my "hard drive" is a ludicrous feature, and I'm guessing only applies to Skype messages and not to SMSs - it would be good if this could be confirmed
 please. When I've had to restore or reimage my phone, SMSs are reloaded back&nbsp;from years ago - I think from when I upgraded to Windows Phone 8 from Windows Phone 7 and use of the Microsoft Account commenced on the phone. So Microsoft is thankfully storing these
 in the cloud. Why not also Skype messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 30 day thing is a reality for Skype messages (and other things like call history), then what happens when your PC crashes and your hard-drive is wiped? Surely this is a use-case that the Skype developers have contemplated? If they have and thought
 it is OK, then that's another story....</p>

<p>Hi, I've given it a good go but using Skype as the default SMS app is just too unreliable.&nbsp;I've gone back to using the WP10 Messaging app for SMSs and Skype separately, which is sub-optimal, but necessary until the issues get sorted out.</p>

    <title>Mouse and Keyboard on Fortnite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse and Keyboard on Fortnite</h2>
                    <p>First of all, Please don't come here and post&nbsp;how mouse and keyboard puts people in a disadvantage vs players with controllers. Getting sick of reading about this when the thread is a "how to" use the devices. Also, if PS4 didn't have this, then I could see the points. PS4 allows mouse and keyboard so the whole argument about fairness is out of the question.<br /><br />Now the main point, when I plug my keyboard, I cannot edit buttons but still works. Mouse however does not work. Any updates or anything on this? How can you use it on PS4 but not Xbox?</p>

            <p>To my understanding,&nbsp;Xbox already&nbsp;does support KB+M&nbsp;input, but <strong><em>only if the game developers individually&nbsp;implement support into their games</em></strong>. Minecraft is the only game I&nbsp;know that supports KB+M input.</p><p><br /></p><p>You must see if Epic Games is interested in adding that support into their Xbox port of Fortnite. Why it is only&nbsp;available on the PS4 version is anybody's guess.</p>

                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm just wondering about something I just noticed:</div>
<div><br />

<div>My Regisrty Cleaner (CCleaner) reports that wmpnscfg.exe is missing from Program Files (x86) for Media Player at startup, but the 64-bit version of the executable is in the Program Files Media Player Folder.</div>
<div><br />

<div>While I haven't noticed anything wrong, probably because I don't share media, why would the OS (Vista Home Premium 64, SP2) look for the 32-bit version of wmpnscfg in the first place if media sharing is on?</div>

<div>Just curious... thanks</div>

<h2>            Xbox one X Slow Download speed</h2>
                    Yesterday I purchased an Xbox One X but when I have started installing my games I have noticed my download speeds are at least 60% slower than they were on my standard Xbox, when I run the 'Detailed network statistics' test on my standard Xbox I get anywhere
 between 60-80Mbps Download speed and 15-20Mbps upload, but when I run the same test on my Xbox one X I only get between 10-15Mbps download and 2-5Mbps upload and this is using the same hardwired connection less 2ft from my router.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp;

            After a slow crawl through every setting, I found my issue to be a networking problem. I was flipping through the triple digit channels in the 5GHz band, but it was all the same until I went down to channel 48. That seems to have resolved my speed issues.
 I was previously keeping the channel&nbsp; at 153 on 5GHz, and only trying higher channels because I was told those would better because there should be less congestion there, but I guess everyone's router is set by default to one of those higher channels. That's
 my guess anyways. I'm all good now.&nbsp;

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you also referring to Windows Live Mail screen being too large? You can adjust the window screen when creating message by moving your cursor to the bottom right of the window. You will see the cursor change appearance then hold the left mouse button
 and drag the window to your preferred size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The windows should not be maximized to adjust the window settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to us with any results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Not necessarily too large...just full screen, and I can't make it anything but full screen. It is either full screen or minimized. When I click on the restore down box the top line&nbsp;of the screen seems to raise up slightly but the rest of the screen stays
 full screen. This just started happening the last couple of days. But my other&nbsp;computers in the office running live mail are fine.&nbsp;

<p>When you clicked on restore down button, you will be able to adjust the Windows Live Mail window. As mentioned on my previous post,&nbsp;move your cursor to the edge (up, right, left or down) of the window, then you will see the cursor change appearance&nbsp;(arrow

            <p>Window sizing is a Windows function, not part of the program. The program will however remember program and message window sizes and positions.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>... there is not option to restore down, only minimize or full screen!&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the <em>Restore</em> button isn't active, the window isn't maximized. Use the control menu (Alt-Spacebar) to move and resize the window using the arrow keys. For example,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press Alt-Spacebar <em>S</em> to activate <em>Size</em>.
<ul>
<li>Press <em>Down arrow </em>↓ once to select the bottom border;</li><li>Press <em>Up arrow </em>↑ three or four times to reduce the height of the window by 30 or 40 pixels;
</li><li>Press <em>Enter</em> to confirm.<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>Press Alt-Spacebar&nbsp;<em>M</em> to activate <em>Move.</em>
<ul>
<li>Press <em>Down arrow </em>↓ to move the window down 10 pixels.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Similar commands resize the window sideways. Holding Control while pressing an arrow key restricts the resizing manœuvre to one pixel per press for accuracy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For message windows, close all but one before resizing: the program will remember the size and position of the last one closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the program window at the size and position you want, close the program and wait a few minutes for it to finish its housekeeping. Now re-launch it - does the window open&nbsp;at the size and position it was before?</p>

            <p>Same, similar problem here: I have to scroll side to side to read every email.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; I just need to reduce the window size of the email message. Font size reduction will work, too ( I assume that would also work for any images in the email,
 but images aren't my primary concern.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your protocol here doesn't work. Alt-Spacebar-S gets me to a selection box where I can select
<em>Size. </em>The mouse changes to a 4-arrow figure, but nothing happens when I press the up arrow.&nbsp; Pressing the down arrow just moves the screen and gets me out of the Resize mode.&nbsp; I'm using Windows 8.&nbsp;

<p>I know it's a bit fiddly, but if you follow the steps precisely, it should work. For example,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-Spacebar opens the window control menu. </li><li>Pressing <em>S</em> then selects the <em>Size</em> function. The&nbsp;menu disappears and you're left with a 4-way-arrow-pointer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>One press of an arrow key then selects the edge to be moved. The pointer changes to a two-way arrow at the edge selected.</li><li>Subsequent presses of the arrow keys in the same plane (left-right or up-down) move that edge by 10 pixels per press in the direction of the arrow pressed. This naturally increases/decreases the size of the window.</li><li>Holding Control pressed while using the arrow keys to resize the window restricts the adjustment to one pixel per press.</li><li>When you're finished adjusting in one plane, press <em>Enter</em> to confirm. Then start again from the beginning to adjust the other plane.</li><li>To <em>Move</em> the window, press <em>M </em>instead of <em>S</em>.</li><li>In this mode, pressing an arrow key has immediate effect. One press will move the window 10 pixels in the dir
</li><li>To move less than 10 pixels in one direction, press an arrow key once, then hold Control and press the opposing arrow once to move the window back one pixel.
</li></ul>
<p>I may be sticking my neck out here, but these manœuvres work in both Windows 7 and Windows 10, so I assume it's the same in Windows 8. They have been the same since Windows 2.0, which will soon be 30 years old.</p>

<h2>            USB external DVD drive not visible in file explorer nor in device manager, unable to access the device</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: USB External DVD drive not being seen by Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer (Lenovo T440s, Windows 8.1 Pro, all updates installed) that I'm trying to connect an external optical drive to (Samsung SE-218CB).&nbsp; I thought this was supposed to be plug and play, but I'm not getting that response.&nbsp; When I plug the
 drive into a USB port, the light on the drive will illuminate, and the disc will spin for a bit and then come to a rest (like when you typically insert a disc into a drive).&nbsp; However, I'm not seeing the drive in either File Explorer or Device Manager.&nbsp; Any
 ideas how to access the device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet had a chance to verify that the drive works, as I don't have another computer sitting around to try it on.&nbsp; I did try the hardware troubleshooter (no luck), and also tried the following line of code in the command line (also with no luck):</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001</span></p>

            <p>I had the same/similar problem: Lenovo Thinkpad T440S wouldn't recognize a SSD in a external enclosure through any of the USB ports. Other computers had no problems recognizing and using that SSD in the same enclosure through their USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>In the BIOS settings (press F1 while booting, make sure FnLck is ON otherwise function key won't be recognized), go to:</p>
<p>BIOS-&gt;Config-&gt;USB-&gt;USB 3.0 Mode</p>
<p>change to "Disabled"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the USB ports will run in USB 2.0 Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Windows 8.1 had no problem "seeing" the external drive, in Disk Manager, File Explorer, etc.. I was able to clone the factory internal HD to the external SSD, then replace the internal HD with the SSD, and boot up &amp; run with zero problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something isn't quite setup right with the current, most updated USB 3.0 drivers for the T440S (as of Sept 6, 2014). &nbsp;I gave up trying to figure out why and/or find the fabled drivers that would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone save the 7 hours of time that I lost.</p>

            <p>Hi Masweig, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be some issues with the USB device controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me with the following information related to this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did you try to connect the USB External DVD drive on a different USB port?</li><li>Did you try to connect a different USB device to your computer and check if the computer recognizes the device?</li><li>Did you make and changes to the computer prior to this issue? Please follow the methods mentioned below.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Check if you are able to see the USB External DVD drive in Disk Management. If you are able to see the USB External DVD drive in Disk Management, follow the steps to assign the drive letter:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the drive that you want to change, and then click <strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To assign a drive letter if one has not already been assigned, click <strong>
Add</strong>, click the letter that you want to use, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>To change a drive letter, click Change, click Assign the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Install the latest Windows Updates. </p>
<p>This method will install the latest device drivers for your USB external DVD drive.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Control Panel.</strong> </li><li>Click on <strong>Windows Update.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. After the scan is complete, click <strong>
Review optional updates</strong>.</li><li>Click the check box next to the updates, then click <strong>Install updates</strong>. If prompted, review the license agreement, then click
<strong>I Accept</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the updates. If prompted, reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your problem still exits, proceed to Method 3. </p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: I would suggest you to un-install and reinstall USB controllers and check. This method resolves steps where the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupted.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>. </li><li>Right click a device and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Repeat for each device. Once complete, restart your computer. </li><li>Your USB controllers will automatically install. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn’t help, I would suggest you to go to the manufacturer website of your computer and install the latest chipset drivers and check.
</p>

<h2>            How to restore full Windows 10 Boot Menu after deleting previous version of Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I no longer need Windows 7 so I deleted the Windows 7 partition.<br />
Now no Boot Menu appears instead Windows 10 just boots.<br />
Troubleshooting menu options are no longer shown. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The<span> OEM installed Windows XP (network disabled) should be shown too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the basic (B/W text) Boot Menu showing just Windows 10 Pro via BCDEDIT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would RESET in Control Panel/Recovery do the trick?</p>

<p>UPDATE - I found how to add a second Windows to the menu using BCDEDIT however that doesn't mean it will boot.&nbsp; It will boot fine if just boot the XP drive in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has drive 1 with XP and boots first to drive 2 with Windows 10 and free space that was Windows 7.</p>
<p>This install of Windows 10 has no Recovery partition yet it had the full Windows GUI Boot Menu before deleting Windows 7 partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are the files for the Windows Boot Menu GUI with Troubleshooting located exactly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the&nbsp;<span>Windows Boot Menu GUI with Troubleshooting load automatically with multi-boot from Windows 10 boot finally repaired?</span></p>

            Instead of trying to RESET or REINSTALL Windows 10 I just waited for the April Update Windows 10 released in May. &nbsp; Note the build 17134 via Microsoft's MCT tool is newer than the Windows Insider download build.<br />
Immediately had the GUI Boot Menu return showing Windows 10, Windows XP and Optional (troubleshooting).<br />
Windows XP doesn't actually boot I will have to repair its boot files.

    <title>Update Bios and drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gillacutte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Bios and drivers</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I was looking for any updates for my Gateway Profile 4 and found a program called BiosAgentPlus which scans the computer to identify Bios version and check for driver updates. It found a bunch of updates but I am wondering where they would be from. I am
 not sure if these are available being I am not sure that Gateway has them available. Some of the drivers are ones that are recommended for a Windows 7 install. I would hate to take this computer out of use because it really seems to work great. Just would
 like to know if these updates can be trusted and the computer will function correctly.
</p>
<p>I am thinking maybe that trying the download and see if the drivers install correctly would mean they will work would be correct assumption?

            <p>If the drivers are not from gateway, than they might work or might not work. Since computer is working, than leave the drivers you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try install those drivers, than make sure to create a backup image of your computer just in case there is a problem. This way you can revert back to your original set up.</p>

            <p>Andrew is correct.&nbsp; Only use drivers from the people who made the hardware.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even for hardware that seems to be standard such as chips [&amp; hence bioses] sold to many computer makers, only the maker knows whether or not they tailored the hardware in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot know if drivers found by that utility you mention are safe, reliable&nbsp;or at all&nbsp;relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bios updates, in particular, are very risky as they cannot normally be undone.&nbsp; If you attempt a bios update using the incorrect software then you can write off your computer permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want safe guidance on tracking down specific drivers then see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/96eddd4e-4b0a-46f1-8c71-96ff380ad272?threadId=03aef37a-f353-4449-89b4-37f417c8a102">

            Okay I tend to agree with that Andrew but the Bios update was found by searching for the Motherboard version and updates. I get the impression with most computers that are made to function with the hardware they were built with. &nbsp;Even though there might
 be Bios updates available you might wonder why they should be used or not used. I suppose that would be determined by a qualified technician. Either way I happened to compare the Bios version that was listed for the update with the version I have now. The
 version I have seems to be a more recent than the one for that is from the update utility. I assume that the date which is part of the version number would indicate how recent it is?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Duncan,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Follow the steps in the link and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2530126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error code: 0x8007042c "Windows firewall cannot change some of your settings" when you try to turn on your Windows Firewall</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform a clean boot and check if it helps.<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the link above to boot your computer normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Run the fix-it and check if it helps.<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Diagnose and fix Windows Firewall service problems automatically
</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: </strong>Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows
 7</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected
 file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the
 cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>, the <strong>sfc /scanonce</strong>, or the <strong>
sfc /scanboot</strong> commands to repair its contents.</p>

<h2>            WFP Invalid Operation</h2>
                    <p>Hi so i keep getting this blue screen initially when idle the when i i start to play a game of LoL and finally when i was trying to update drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently reformatted my laptop because previously my wifi driver was acting very strange, it would disable by itself specifically when playing an online game (LoL). I tried to use a usb network adapter which initially worked but eventually it would disconnect
 while still showing the wifi logo and sometimes rhe wifi logo would be completely gone as in gone no option of wifi.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            The right-click on the desktop issue may be a separate issue.
<br />
<br />The blue screen error appears to be caused by the Qcamain10x64.sys, which is the Atheros wireless adapter driver:
<br />
<br />BugCheck 1D3, {3eb, 0, 0, 0}
<br />
<br />Probably caused by : Qcamain10x64.sys ( Qcamain10x64!ath_pcie_bug_check+3cc )
<br />
<br />Can you update the Atheros wireless adapter to the latest version available from ASUS for the laptop.
<br />
<br />Also, there appears to be an older version of McAfee installed so try also uninstalling McAfee and use Windows built-in antivirus and firewall.

</p><p>I just updated the Atheros driver but im not sure how to find the latest, i updated it through device manager but i checked the latest driver is dated 2019 but the installed driver is dated&nbsp;16/09/2018 and i did the update driver again and it said that windows
 has determined that the latest driver is installed, and am deleting the Mcafee, although how would i know if it is fixed, do i have to wait idly or should i try to play a game and see if it BSOD occurs?</p>

            Just a quick update: i successfully played a game without it crashing but am still kinda skeptical because before i reformatted it was also like that then the network adapter would just suddenly die on me. Hoping this problem is fixed. And is it normal
 for a laptop to boot 5-7 minutes (have quick boot or whatever turned off though)?

            For the Atheros wireless adapter can you check the following which may help determine if you have the latest driver:
<br />
<br />In the Device Manager double-click the wireless adapter &gt; Driver
<br />
<br />What is the "Driver Version" ?
<br />
<br />Then click on the  "Details" tab, then choose "Hardware Ids" from the drop-down menu under "Property".
<br />
<br />What is listed under "Value"?
<br />
<br />Also, 5 to 7 minutes to boot seems long.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling McAfee does the same issue exist?

            That is normal to have four. <br />
<br />
You could try the following driver only installation from Killer Networking: <br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.killernetworking.com/download/killer-drivers-installation-64bit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.killernetworking.com/download/k...</a>
<br />
<br />
The driver should work as there is a matching Hardware Id in the netathr10x.inf: <br />
<br />
PCI\VEN_168C&amp;DEV_0042&amp;SUBSYS_2B311A3B&amp;REV_31 ;for Asus <br />
<br />
After installing the driver check that the Driver Version is 12.0.0.832 <br />
<br />
If issues persist you could try an older driver available for ASUS for the laptop.
<br />
<br />
If other wireless adapters behave similar the issue may be not be related to the driver. Updating the BIOS may help in that case.

<h2>            ACPI error event 13&#58; a benign error or something serious&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been getting this weird ACPI error spamming me every now and then, sometimes as quick as 3 mins or as long as an hour. I didn't notice I have this error until I tried out various Windows diagnostic tools. Event Viewer gave me all these errors,
 but after searching online, I still couldn't fix it. Often this error occurs during blue screens, and its error message also signals something seriously wrong with embedded controllers and the BIOS or UEFI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have been spammed by these errors, I have no problems with using the laptop for daily usage, coding, gaming, video streaming, etc. My unit seems healthy and butter smooth in operations, but why I keep getting this serious error? Can you just ignore
 it? If not, can someone tell me how to fix it? I have updated my MS-ACPI-compliant drivers, BIOS and my Intel graphics drivers to latest versions. I read a post where you can fix the problem by disabling Intel's Panel Self-Refresh feature. I don't have that
 feature, so I don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My GPU is UHD 620 and CPU is i7-8550U, if this can help. If graphic cards are not to be blamed, is there something else within power management that has conflicting settings?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi ChunGoh0306,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.

<br />ACPI error 13 can be unnecessarily triggered sometimes. As long as your PC works fine, there is no need to pay attention to this.

<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the answer to this question. I will put it here so for future references, this question has an answer. It was due to Notebook Fan Control (NBFC) directly accessing my EC, therefore causing this error. You can check out similar report
<a href="https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/issues/239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I am currently disabling my NBFC to check if such problem persists. It seems to have gone away for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Goh.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes and they are scams so you should hangup - do not give them ANY information. As you did this<br />
time, come here if you have any contacts such as those that you specifically did not initiate.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Not reading disk in DVD drive in Parallels</h2>
                    I just installed Parallels Desktop 7 and Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit on my 1 year old iMac recently upgraded to OS X Lion. &nbsp;The windows 7 program will not read a disk in my dvd drive. &nbsp;The program is Liberty Street StampManage software for 2011. &nbsp;The
 software says it works on windows 7 64 bit. &nbsp; I was able to install this program on my older Dell with XP with no problems. &nbsp;Please any help would be appreciated, I want to use windows programs on my mac not my old Dell. &nbsp;Thank you so much.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur with all the disks or just the Liberty Street StampManage disk?<br />
2. What is the format of the file in the disk?<br />
<br />

            <p>I have a similar problem. Only the Mac side of the disk&nbsp;partition reads the DVD, the Windows side creates a new drive on the computer containing the music tracks on the DVD but the program being run on Windows (Sony SonicStage) cannot read it. Message just
 appears telling me&nbsp;to insert a CD/DVD into drive (which is already there!). Apple suggested closing programs on Mac that may be trying to access the DVD drive (such as iTunes) which I did but the&nbsp;problem remains.</p>
<p>However if I re-boot just into the Windows (not using Parallels) it will work as normal, but the point of using Parallels is to avoid any&nbsp;re-booting. I had to re-boot to load all my operating disks onto the new Mac for my cameras, scanner, Photoshop, Sonic
 Stage because every time I inserted a disk nothing happened when using Parallels partition.</p>

I have encountered an error of 0x80070490. Now I'm using win 10. Win 8 I have installed net framework 3.5. So I suggested microsoft should ditch this off.
