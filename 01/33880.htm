<h2>            Bootable Cloned HDD transfer to New PC with different MOBO and Processors</h2>
                    I clone my HDD in a bootable format on a regular basis as a backup should my HDD fail.&nbsp; My computer is now 7 years old and it needs to be replaced.&nbsp; I plan to build a new machine.&nbsp; Obviously the MOBO and processor will be quite different.&nbsp; How can I transfer
 my cloned HDD with Windows 10 to the new machine and associate the Win 10 license with the new machine?&nbsp; In the activation section of my Windows 10 settings it says that my license is activated with a digital license linked to my Microsoft account.

<p>You cannot transfer your existing Windows installation to the new PC. You must install Windows from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether your licence is linked to your MS account is irrelevant. What matters is the type of licence you have. If it is an OEM licence (=Windows 7 was pre-installed) then you must purchase a new licence. If it is a Retail version (you bought it separately)
 then it is transferrable.</p>

            Hi,
<br />How did you get Windows? 
<br />If it was preinstalled you may not use it after motherboard replacement unfortunately. 
<br />If you bought Windows in Microsoft Store or in local retail store, you may need to call Microsoft support during work hours and ask a help from support person.
<br />Digital license cannot help you because it is valid only for unchanged software.
<br />For easy transfer please make sure you old computer has hard disk controller in AHCI mode - this will allow to boot from old drive and Windows will auto-set almost all drivers. If  controller is set in legacy or raid mode the additional operations may be required.

            Thanks for the reply. Its been a while but i believe i purchased an OEM version of windows 7, then over time migrated to windows 8 and then 10. &nbsp;If i dont have the proper license can i follow the steps you mentioned and call/pay MS to activate the software
 on the new machine? &nbsp;

            Hi ME.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can always apply the image if you are happy with that install, whether you need to buy a new license or not.  It's just the install, not the activation. and WIndows 10 is surprisingly adaptable to different hardware like no WIndows before it.  
<br />
<br />Even if the underlying qualifying license is OEM which cannot transfer motherboards, Microsoft has increasingly made exceptions for Builder's OEM to move to new hardware.  Even the new Change Hardware procedure by signing into the MS Account on the new hardware and running the Activation Troubleshooter allows the Troubleshooter to issue an exception for underlying OEM if all else is Correct.  So that's worth at least trying.  If the Troubleshooter won't activate the new hardware,  I'd contact Microsoft Support via one of these methods:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works out then buy a new Product Key here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>.  You won't find any discount keys online that are legit.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You may buy new full Windows 10 license in Microsoft Store. Than there should be no any problems with its activation.

<h2>            Microsoft Called</h2>
                    This morning a private number woke me up about 7am EST after the 5th time in a row called me claiming to be with Microsoft it sounded fishy since the call came up private number and the 2 men i spoke to had middle eastern accents. They claimed my computer
 was at serious risk since it is 6 years old and Microsoft security runs out after 5. They had me run "eventvwr" "msconfig" and "iexplore www.ammyy.com" . I was skeptical but they had my computer id number or whatever it was so i played along and at the ammyy
 site i very briefly gave them access to my computer until i saw they had full access so i shut down the program revoking their access and hung up after they tried to sell me a software license for a lifetime at only $321 which is also fishy. I just want to
 make sure that my computer is safe and that this wasn't actually microsoft thank for your help.

            <p>Hello BryanGreene2224</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is simply a scam</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your PC periodically sends error reports to Microsoft. This helps Microsoft determine which problems are affecting users the most. During the transfer of these error reports technical information is transferred between your PC and the Microsoft server. NO
 personal details are transferred, so ask yourself 'how did they get my details?'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any company (or individual) can obtain a database of potential clients providing they are willing to pay a fee for that information. It may simply be an electoral list which could include your address and telephone number. Whichever list it is that list
 gives that company/person all the details they need to cold call you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unless you have a pre-paid support contract with Microsoft then Microsoft 'will never' telephone you regarding a problem with your machine. Yes there are Microsoft Certified Software technicians out there, but they don't work for Microsoft they work for
 independent companies.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you get a similar call again simply replace the telephone receiver and have no more to do with the caller. Under no circumstances should you allow them remote access to your PC. Doing so is fatal. All that they are after is your personal details such
 as computer password, banking details and passwords etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you let them have access to your PC they will obtain personal information from your hard drive. The best option if this happens is to completely re-install Windows. This will erase any application that they have placed on your PC.</p>
<p><br />

<div>I just had the same phone call from someone with a Middle Eastern accent with a telephone number (972-728-0074) supposedly located in Denver CO, saying he was calling from Microsoft. &nbsp;He told me that I had dowloaded a piece of software called esent.exe
 that would infect and slow down my computer. &nbsp;When I was sceptical, he said to verify by calling 1-800-642-7676 or e-mail *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;He purported to have my IPS number, which sounded correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I searched for the file on my computer and found none (well, it could be a hidden file), although there were several called esentutl.exe all dated 7/13/2009, which was probably when ACER built my computer and installed basic files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then called Best Buy and asked their Geek Squad if it was a scam and they said it was. &nbsp;I assume they are correct, but wanted to post this information so Microsoft can find these scammers and stop them. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Games keep constantly freezing or exit out</h2>
                    <p>For the past days I’ve been having trouble to even start games such as Fornite or Elder Scrolls Online, but they all seem to freeze and stop working. This didn’t happen to me before as i could perfectly play but now I can’t even get past tittle screen. I’ve tried turning off console ect. and nothing seems to work. Please help me resolve this as it makes me angry to not be able to play games that I own.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I’ve restarted it multiple times and just factory reseted it but the problem seems to keep occurring. I was able to play a couple weeks ago before the update for my xbox. No clue if that has to do with it as i can play destiny 2 which is on disc and its only occuring on some of my digital games.</p>

<h2>            Missing Icon Images and Folder Tree in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an unusual Windows Explorer problem. Basically I am not seeing any of the default folder icons. My folder navigation tree on the left panel only shows Quick Access. And sometimes, the "address bar" slowly fills green as though it is loading a
 search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My temporary fix for this is to open the Task Manager, close Windows Explorer, and reopen it. But this fix lasts only for a few minutes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version of League of Legends are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to click on this Microsoft Compatibility link and check if the game (League of Legends) you are using is compatible with Windows 8.1 or not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If installing the game in compatibility mode doesn’t work, you need to contact the game vendor support and check for latest update, which might help you to run the League of Legends on Windows 8.1.</p>

    <title>New Lenovo Laptop running Windows 10 shutdown after a recent Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jac_118  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Lenovo Laptop running Windows 10 shutdown after a recent Windows update</h2>
                    <p>After a recent update I was unable to logoff ... my laptop would appear to be shutting down but would then jump to my desktop screen. After a couple of days I decided I would&nbsp; use the power switch to shut down, rather then trying to logoff; that did it.
 However the next day when I powered up my laptop, rather than opening my desktop screen, the first screen I saw was to check whether I want my keyboard in US or some other language; following that I am then brought to a screen that gives me a number of options
 to fix my laptop, however none will help. This is all I get on my laptop that is now less than 3 months old.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. <br />

It seems that your operating system is running properly that's why you're always see the keyboard layout and the Recovery Environment. Since the Advanced options didn't resolve the issue, we suggest
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a Media Creation Tool</a></strong> to repair your Windows 10.

<p>In this case, you need to clean install your Windows 10 using the ISO.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Charger light turns off for a second in approx 10s intervals</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Surface Pro 3 crashed today and I suspect that battery/power cable got damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start my SP3 (or a hard reset by holding the power button for 30s), I get nothing. The charger light is semi-stable (it is on most of the time, with occasional 1 second interruptions in between).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to clean the contacts with little effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering whether some of you might have encountered the problem and if so, how did you solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should a part (or an accessory) of my SP3 be changed, does Microsoft support shipping to areas outside where SP3 is sold?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>A quick check. Bluetooth and WiFi are on the same chip.</p>
<p>If Bluetooth does not work along with your WiFi you have a hardware failure.</p>
<p>What does the device manager say about both?</p>

    <title>Windows Aero Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robby db  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Aero Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Dimension 4600 (not my primary computer), which came with Windows XP Home Edition. Recently, I upgraded it to Windows Vista Home Premium, and Windows Aero worked completely fine, and the screen resolution, 1920x1080 @ 60Hz, worked completely
 fine as well. When I installed Windows 7 Home Premium on the secondary hard drive, everything worked except for Windows Aero and the screen resolution. I have looked around the internet, and tried different hacks, but none of them seem to work. My graphics
 card is a "<strong>NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM)</strong>" according to device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to upgrade this computer to Windows 7 Home Premuim, because Windows Vista is certainly not a version of Windows that I particularly enjoy. I know that I could get a newer graphics card, but if this one clearly has the capability to do
 what I want it to do, I see no reason in going to get a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any workarounds? Am I missing something? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Robert</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some system conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run the <strong>Aero troubleshooter.</strong></li><li>Open Control Panel and type Troubleshooting in the Search box.</li><li>Select <strong>Find and fix</strong> problems.</li><li>Under<strong> Appearance </strong>and <strong>Personalization</strong>, select
<strong>Display Aero desktop effects.</strong></li><li>In the Troubleshooter dialog, click the advanced link and place a check mark in the Apply Repairs Automatically option.</li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>to run the <strong>troubleshooter.</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>(EDIT: Oops - Fredric posted the succinct version while I was typing and searching for the file name ;) )</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows folder is generally not one which you should be deleting <em>anything</em> from.</p>
<p>Is there a problematic driver that led you to System32, or just browsing Windows out of interest ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you verified McAfee is not listed in Programs and Features ?</p>
<p>You may not have intentionally installed McAfee AV, but it may have been installed with another</p>
<p>software you have recently installed or updated. </p>
<p>It can be easy to click past the option to install various programs such as Chrome browser and McAfee
</p>
<p>as the option generally defaults to 'yes install', leaving it up to the user to clear the tick box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If McAfee is listed in Programs and Features uninstall it, and if these files are still there after</p>
<p>(or if McAfee is not installed ) try renaming them. </p>
<p>I usually add a 1a at the front as this pushes the file to the top of the list, making it easier to find later.</p>
<p>If no issues develop over the next few weeks you should be able to delete them safely later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>mfeaack.sys&nbsp;&nbsp; .69e6.deleteme</em></p>
<p>The first part is the driver itself. I don't know what the rest is about, but believe anything</p>
<p>after a file extension (.sys - for driver) is a footnote of sorts.</p>
<p>I expect someone at McAfee would have an idea what this is about.</p>

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />

If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

<h2>            Chinese Fonts Rendering Problem on Windows 10 Pro &#40;English&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Window 10 Pro on my laptop with <strong>English as the display language and Chinese Language Pack installed</strong>. In some places, the Chinese characters are not rendering correctly. For example, file names containing Chinese in the File
 Explorer, characters in some desktop apps or the context menu etc. while in some other apps like the preinstalled Office (I bought my laptop in China with Windows Home version and Office Home Edition and upgraded the Windows to Pro using a key from my university.)
 or the web browser, the Chinese characters are displaying well. See the screenshots in various scenarios below. I set the region to Germany because I live now in here (I guess region setting has nothing to do with the font issue but nonetheless I also provided
 the info here) and<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I don't want to use Chinese as the display language because some German programs will then get problems</span>. So I was wondering, how should I adjust the setting so that the Chinese characters will
 display uniformly correctly?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5af8f202-1e9b-4e6e-9fdb-1a1bc47ab2a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5af8f202-1e9b-4e6e-9fdb-1a1bc47ab2a5" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So far, I tried&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Language\Advanced settings\Apply language settings to the welcome screen, system accounts, and new user accounts\Change system locale</span>
 to Chinese but it didn't work;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I searched the Internet and someone suggested it might be a problem of incorrect font mapping, that is, the system first searched the characters in Japanese fonts, if not found, then it would search in Chinese fonts. So I also tried
 to modify fontlink in the registry to prioritize the Chinese fonts over the Japanese fonts
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(HKLM–&gt;Software–&gt;Microsoft–&gt;Windows NT–&gt;CurrentVersion–&gt;Fontlink–&gt;SystemLink)</span> but had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really annoying and I hope I can finally find a way to deal with the problem here.
</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your generous help!</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to remove the driver, re-install them, install the latest for 8.1 using compatibility mode...</p>

            My normal LAN adapter is a TP-Link USB WN822N v3.&nbsp; This was not available after upgrade and despite reinstallation didn't work.&nbsp; The TP Link SW isn't allowed to take control of WLAN management.&nbsp; My Realtek wired port is also not working, traffic flashing
 on the port, but I have no network connections.&nbsp; I've also had to roll back to 8.1.&nbsp; I'm frustrated because the experience as an Insider on my work laptop has been seamless

            I had the same problem and what I will say next, I could using a cable to connect to the internet. If your wireless driver is Intel, enter the site that update drivers intel, download the program that scans for new drivers. This program automatically found
 an update for my wireless drive, which started to operate after the update.

            That was the first thing I did, but all my NIC drivers were screwed.&nbsp; I finished up formatting the system drive, reinstalling windows8 , applying all the updates, upgrading to 8.1, then doing the 10 upgrade from DVD. That's a day of my life I won't get
 back.&nbsp; All my other devices worked fine, including my Lind 10 tablet which I was really concerned about.

<h2>            Start From Fresh</h2>
                    <p>I have, for over a year had problems because of having, somehow, a new user folder created as UserName.MachineName.&nbsp; I tried all of the steps I was advised on 30 October 2017 by, amongst others, Darleen Pen, Donna Men, and by reading similar problems that
 Vijayj.r had experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, again, after defragmenting Drive F, the problems I had before have started again eg I am unable to access my File History except via the File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an experienced user.&nbsp; What I would prefer to do is to sacrifice all of my files and user information.&nbsp; (I have downloaded what personal files I wish to keep to disc) and START AGAIN with all of my user and&nbsp; personal files .&nbsp; I am assuming that my
 System files are OK but I could , if necessary, us System Restore if necessary.&nbsp; This seems to me to be the only answer although I realise I may be naïve about the solutions available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that something is very wrong.&nbsp; My screen is jumping up and down in a very unstable way.&nbsp; Please tell how to start again on this computer.&nbsp; I do not care about my personal files.</p>

            Hi Haz, 
<br />
<br />I’m sorry you have gone through this issues, but we can try to get them resolved via a reset or clean install. I’m glad you’ve already backed up your files. 
<br />
<br />We can do this 2 ways, a reset, and remove everything. Or if you have a USB drive (8gb at least) you can use, we can build media and go that way. I’ll list both below:
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings
<br />
<br />Click on Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery 
<br />
<br />Once in that tab, click on “Get Started” under Reset this PC. 
<br />
<br />This should take a moment, and you’ll be prompted to “Keep my files” or “Remove everything” - The process will start once one is chosen, your pc will reboot and a clean install of windows will start.
<br />
<br />This will probably be the easier of the 2 options. 
<br />
<br />Next, is my preferred route:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />The two links above are to the Windows 10 iso, and how to build the bootable usb.
<br />

<br />Once you build the media, you’ll boot your laptop to it. you’ll elect to install windows. It’ll then go to a page where it shows you all your partitions, highlight and delete them all, until you have 1 unpartitioned drive, then click “next” and the install process will start.

<p>Thank you so much Charlie for replying so soon.&nbsp; You are dealing with a completely self-taught novice who has made many mistakes in the past.&nbsp; I want to take the easiest route (although I did create an ISO file on F drive and also on OneDrive but I think
 I will probably play safe and download from the Network again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To show you how little knowledge I have, when I ask, during the Reset, to remove 'everything'&nbsp; will this allow me to start with new usernames and if I do start again
 will any of this data reappear eg from my F drive - should I clean off F drive first (including my ISO file)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I have no confidence that my ISO file will achieve what I need anyway.&nbsp; Please bear with me.</span></p>

            No worries at all, this is why I’m here. 
<br />
<br />I think a “reset” removing everything is your best bet. This bring you back to the point where it asks your keyboard layout, region, username, etc. Like a clean build, only you’re letting windows doing it instead of you. 
<br />
<br />Your files in OneDrive and Box will be accessible, as long as you have your login information for both of them. Your OneDrive account is probably your microsoft account, correct? 
<br />
<br />And a Windows.Old folder will be available in your C drive after you do the reset. You’ll be able to wipe that out if you’d like, or, keep it, as it won’t hurt anything but take up some hard drive space. if you have room to spare, I’d leave it. 
<br />
<br />I will be here for you thoughout the process, let me know and we’ll move forward!

            I really appreciate your help Charlie.&nbsp; If I do not do this today, it is not because I do not want to get on but I have physical issues and I have to feel at my best before undertaking this.&nbsp; It is really good to know I have support through it.&nbsp; Speak
 soon.

            No worries, make sure you’re feeling up to par and then go from there. Make sure to drop me a line later or tomorrow morning regardless so this thread stays open. I’m not sure how long it is, but a certain period of inactivity will close it. <br /><br />You’re very welcome btw. I’ll be here!<br />- C

<p><span>Charlie, I have a further problem which threatens to scupper my plans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have copied all of my documents, etc to disc but I had not thought about emails which I would not be able to access when I delete my user.computername files.<span> &nbsp;
</span>I have spent the morning exploring how to download these emails, have ended up with Archive files in an .mbox extension format, which I now find that I can only now return, using eg’Thunderbird’ program, into
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If I intend to erase all trace of these user.computername files and I cannot save my emails into eg Box, it would seem that I must sacrifice my email folders when I ‘Remove Everything’ from my computer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, when I remove my username from the computer, surely, this will mean that I can not access even my OneDrive files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I rename my username account name as my old username won’t the old user.computername files also just reemerge.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It seems to me now that I must sacrifice EVERYTHING even my Box files because, again, these files are accessed using my own username as the Account on Box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure it is my own ignorance which is not able to find a way through this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am sorry to ask but can you help me yet again?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think that I must be driving you mad and I have not started the Recovery work yet.</span></p>

            Ok... your email account, who is your provider? Hotmail, yahoo, gmail? If it’s a web/cloud based email, you should be able to log into it and retrieve all your emails. 
<br />
<br />Next, your OneDrive and Box accounts live in the cloud. As long as you have your credentials, you can log into ANY computer, and retrieve those files. You can create a username called Bananas, and still log into your OneDrive account.. again, as long as you have your microsoft/OneDrive account credentials. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this is making sense :)

<p>Hello Charlie</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you say about Cloud-based accounts being accessible after I have 'purged' my computer.&nbsp; I am still a bit perplexed about how I can use the
<p>When this first happened over a year ago, I read on the Microsoft Community that my problem (above) could be caused by having a SID (sequence of numbers and letters) - an unknown user - given in the permissions of my folders in File History, instead of my
 own username - possibly my user account from a previous install?&nbsp; I did, at the time, try to change back ownership to my username but it would not change.&nbsp; If you have any thoughts on this before I remove everything from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry that these problems are taking me so long to finally resolve, but I want to be sure, before I make such a big jump, whether&nbsp; I could resolve the issue.&nbsp; Otherewise I am convinced that these rogue username.computername files will just return again.</p>
