<h2>            Fixing locked XP Home OEM after motherboard replacement</h2>
                    
<p>I'm repairing an HP Pavilion with XP home SP3 locked to the fried motherboard as a favor to a friend.&nbsp; My friend insists on XP and wants/needs to preserve the installed programs &amp; data on the drive (which is still good when tested elsewhere).&nbsp; It has some
 business radio reprogramming s/w that only runs under XP.&nbsp; We know he'll need to buy a retail version.&nbsp; I can't find what really works, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292607 says it can be upgraded to XP Pro (which he'd like) but that only covers SP1.&nbsp; My
 proposed seller says home can't be upgraded to Pro without a full reinstall and hasn't answered home oem to home retail.&nbsp; XP Mode under W7 pro isn't an option, if the serial port -&gt; radio timing isn't exactly right the expensive business radios become expensive
 bricks and he won't risk it like he will with XP on new MB/CPU.&nbsp; He has current image backups but they're still locked, of course.&nbsp; The drive passes the vendor's test (in another machine, of course).<br />
<br />
Can XP Home SP3 OEM be upgraded to XP Pro SP3 without a reinstall (i.e reformat &amp; install)?&nbsp; Can XP Home SP3 OEM be "upgraded" to XP Home SP3 Retail without reinstalling?&nbsp; Is there a better way (keeping XP)&nbsp; to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Final result:&nbsp; After installing the new motherboard the retail XP Pro SP3 install disk would not recognize the installed of XP home SP3, said there wasn't an OS on the partion, and did not offer an upgrade option.&nbsp; The sofware supplier was right, and the
 KB article quoted above wrong, at least for SP3-&gt;SP3 on this particular configuration.</p>
<p>I then booted off the original hard drive and attempted a phone activation, which failed.&nbsp; The robovoice said to try updating the license key, which I did using the one on the COA, then trying phone activation again.</p>
<p>That worked.&nbsp; There's still a few more drivers to dl and install, but the box is working again with a new MB and dual core CPU without a reinstall or OS update.</p>
<p>So despite all the stories about tattooed motherboards and being unable reactivate XP if they're replaced, the actual reactivation was relatively straightforward.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Windows Installer 3.1&#59; &#34;Not enough storage is available to process this command.&#34; How can I fix this and install it&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've recently had some troubles uninstalling java 6 x32 and x64. I manually deleted the files causing some error that does not allow me to uninstall them from the control panel. The java installer couldn't uninstall them either; I got an error 1723. I did some
 searching and some solutions came up for this error.<br />
<br />
I tried stopping the windows installer service. <br />
Deleting a java registry under some directory(I can look it up in further detail if requested)<br />
Stopped the windows installer service then proceeded to delete another registry&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSIServer<span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S</span><span style="font-style: italic">M</span><span style="font-style: italic">IServer
 subkey.</span>&nbsp; <br />
Ran Microsoft fix it for the Java issues. (No luck because I cant reinstall them anyway.)<br />
<br />
I then attempted to reinstall windows installer 3.1 but got an error "Not enough storage is available to process this command." "Installation not completed"<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss for what else I can do right now, can anyone help me reinstall Windows installer?<br />

<p>How much space is there on the c:drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download Windows Installer from&nbsp;the following link and check:</p>

            There is currently 170GB free on my hardrive.<br />
<br />
I've also tried all of the links there(minus the server files) and when running they all tell me that the update is not applicable.
<br />
<br />
I also ran the fix-it and had no luck. I couldn't find the installer program on the list it gave, too. Any other advice?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Method&nbsp;1:</strong></p>
<p>I would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7&nbsp;from the above provided&nbsp;KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method&nbsp;2:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>If clean boot does not work, it may be prudent to use system restore to go back to a time before you have deleted all of these registry keys.</p>

<p>I'm having exactly the same problem on a Windows 10 system, despite the fact that I've been able to install heavyweight software like Visual Studio Enterprise and SQL Server 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own belief is that the Windows Installer 3.1 installer is reporting an incorrect error. Given what I have been able to install, I cannot believe that there is insufficient storage on my system. I have 8GB of physical memory, 21GB free on my C drive and
 899GB free on my D drive. I simply cannot believe that Windows Installer requires more than 21GB of storage, or that it needs more than Visual Studio or SQL Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix-it program was also a chocolate teapot. It gave up when I selected Not Listed because of Windows Installer 3.1 not being listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I've also tried Windows Installer 4.5, and after an annoying game of pick-the-right-version, finally received the same error message as 3.1 was giving me.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 User Login Icons missing at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wjasons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 User Login Icons missing at startup</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 on an HP Elitebook 8470p.&nbsp; After installing the Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 driver, the user login icons disappear from the login screen.&nbsp; I've tried installing this driver before and after installing the video driver with the same result&nbsp;
 Obviously, HP got it to work since the product worked out of the box; however, HP Support told me to re-image.&nbsp; This problem seems to have been around since Windows 7 was released but I can't find a solution.&nbsp; I've encountered the problem on other PCs (both
 desktops and laptops) and with random drivers.&nbsp; Was hoping Microsoft would have&nbsp;a fix for this by now.&nbsp; Otherwise, does anyone know for sure if it might have to do with the order in which drivers are installed?

    <title>Is Avast a safe Antivirus&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dairyproducts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Avast a safe Antivirus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently found a free antivirus software called Avast. I'm just wondering if it is safe to install and if it is worth it.</p>
<p>If you can, please answer ASAP. My McAfee is running out.</p>
<p>I have seen other users encounter BSoD(STOP) errors and viruses that made its way onto the PC.</p>
<p>My PC is a Dell Inspiron 11 Series 3000. I have no malware or any history of malware(after a reset). I do have an active firewall at the moment(McAfee), but it will run out in a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Comder.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run a full scan with Malwarebytes free scanner: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />You can turn off the free trial at any time in the app's Settings &gt; Account Details.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Comdervids
<br />
<br />Which Security solution you use on your PC is a personal choice, Windows 10 itself has a very good built in Security Center, which is plenty for most users
<br />
<br />I have used Avast Free for many years, I have never had an issue or any sort of infection on my PC whilst using that Avast Security Suite, it is probably the best of the free solutions.
<br />
<br />The only thing I did find, is when it installs, choose Custom install and only install the features you need on your PC, it can tend to install a lot of stuff you will never need
<br />
<br />NOTE: before you install any new security suite, you need to completely remove McAfee, which is not easy to do. McAfee know there is an issue removing their software and provide a tool (MCPR) to completely remove that:

<p>I don't claim to be an expert, but I've used <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>Avast Home Free</em></span> since 2005 and the only problems I've had is an occasional false positive,</p>
<p>but I have never had a virus or malware in that time.</p>
<p>(Note the '<em>free</em>' part. The full paid for version does have some bloatware, as do all the major 'Security' programs.
</p>
<p>McAfee, Norton, Kasspersky are perhaps the most notorious system hogs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Avast Home Free has very little impact on system resources and has never caused performance issues on my machines in that time.</p>
<p>Having said that.... All AV's are known to cause issues from time to time. There is no perfect AV. Not even Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do<em> not </em>run two AV's real time concurrently. This does have potential to cause conflicts and hamper performance.</p>
<p>It's OK to have two installed so you can run manual scan to cross-check your main AV's scan though.</p>
<p>I run Malwarebytes on files I download now and then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"I have seen other users encounter BSoD(STOP) errors and viruses that made its way onto the PC."</em></p>
<p>- The bad guys are always bringing in new virus\malware. The best protection is due diligence. Top on my list (aside from</p>
<p>having my AV running and updating full time) is never open an email without being certain who it is from
</p>
<p>(including familiar companies you have not contacted directly in the past few days), and don't use torrent download sites.</p>

<h2>            csrss.exe - application error </h2>
                    
<p>CSRSS.EXE - Application Error "the application failed to intialize properly oxc0000005" (WIN XP Pro SP3)</p>
<p>Have been trying to fix this issue for the past few weeks. for the most part been restarting the PC to correct this issue. As of today it has been comming up more frequent. When this issue does come up have does not&nbsp;create a&nbsp;blue screen failure event. With
 some of the other research found that this may be caused by a corrupt logon user. I am ruling that out as this failure will happen on any user including the administrator user logon. Also ruling out virus infection in the system 32 folder as task manager showing
 only one "csrss of 3814kb" being used. system scanned with "exterminate it" and "bitdefender" with no activity and system clean.</p>
<p>On attempt to correct I have gone back in system restore&nbsp;with no sucsess, I have also ran the "SFC/SCANNOW" also on attempt to corrrect concern with no success. What I mean by no suscess is that above error still continues. Disk scan utility , defrag was
 used also with no success , csrss error continued.</p>
<p>I do not believe this is user issue it is deeper. I do use RDC (remote desktop connection) terminal window&nbsp;and found today if attmpting to use RDC&nbsp;with correct IP address that the error failure for CSRSS.EXE will pop up. RDC will not connect.&nbsp;I also have
 tried to make a back up using NT back up utility and the program freezes,does not open uses resources in task manager.&nbsp;(to eliminate possible corrupt user folder)</p>
<p>Next step is ?</p>

<p>The csrss.exe is the Windows Client Server Run-time Subsystem and is a frequent target of malicious software.&nbsp; You should always see one instance of it running in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Even though you have run Exterminate It and BitDefender, realize that:</p>
<p>Malicious software also knows about popular scanning tools and has practiced learning how to hide from them.</p>
<p>Just because Exterminate It and BitDefender do not find anything does not mean your system is clean.&nbsp; It does mean that they did not find anything they know about or recognize.</p>
<p>No malicious software scanning tool seems to know about everything, so expand your anti horizons a bit with some different tools.</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow is a waste of time and will never help you unelsss you are trying to update files in this folder:</p>
<p><strong>%Systemroot\system32\dllcache</strong> &nbsp; (this is the only folder sfc /scannow cares about).</p>
<p>Tell us more about your environment and run a couple different scanning softwares and then troubleshoot any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />

<p>Was this once a Windows 2000 machine you upgraded to XP (just curious).</p>

<p>Was a W2K Pro when born. Upgraded to WXP Pro in 2007. Up till&nbsp;now have had no issues and no errors.</p>
<p>The "C" drive was replaced the first part of this year due to failure. The OS was built from the ground up as I have all the original OS disks. From that point till now again no issues or concerns.</p>
<p>I will run the two programs and report back later on. My thought process is this also could be hardware related due to other&nbsp;OS functions and features also have&nbsp;not run as they should. (Recently NT back up, remote desktop, and hang time on other programs
 that run. See first thread) Hardware as in a memory stick(s) not reading or&nbsp;writting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's what I thought... &nbsp;The C:\WINNT gives it away...</p>
<p>Let's see how things look after the scans. &nbsp;I don't know much about Remote Desktop, but at least when you get done, you will know what it's not and you will have a better starting point.</p>
<p>What are you currently using for malicious software protection?</p>
<p>If you suspect and want to test your RAM, do this:</p>
<p>Run a test of your RAM with memtest86+ (I know it is boring and will cost you a CD).<br />
<br />
Memtest86+ is a more up to date version of the old memtest86 program and they are not the same.<br />
<br />
The memtest86+ will not run under Windows, so you will need to download the ISO file and create a bootable CD, boot on that and then run the memtest86+ program.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If even a single error is reported that is a failure and should make you suspicious of your RAM.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple sticks of RAM you may need to run the test on them one at a time and change them out to isolate the failure to a particular single stick.<br />
<br />
Always keep at least the first bank of RAM occupied so the test will find something to do and there is enough to boot your system.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, reseating the RAM in the slots will relieve the error but a failure is still cause for suspicion.<br />
<br />
The file and instructions are here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
Here is a link that shows you have to create and use the memtest86+ CD:<br />

<p>If someone says to run memtest86, you can tell them to go pound sand and that you know memtest86+ supercedes memtest86 and here's why:&nbsp;<br />

<p>Yeah - I know what&nbsp; PUM is...</p>
<p>I don't know what your csrss error is though, so I would look for more clues in the Event Viewer right after you see one.&nbsp; If you Event Viewer logs are clogged up with old stuff, consider clearning them so there is not so much stuff to look through and focus
 on events from the time of the message.</p>
<p>Look in the Event Viewer for clues around the time of the incident.<br />
<br />
Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default<br />
settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If<br />
you enable the logging for them the logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with<br />
all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity<br />
or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.&nbsp;<br />
Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.&nbsp;<br />
Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp; Try to find just the events at the date<br />
and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are<br />
black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like<br />
two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button<br />
under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste<br />
or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp; Remove any personal information from your information<br />
after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />

To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered),<br />
then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the<br />
events that are happening when you have your issue.<br />
<br />
You can look up events on the following World Wide Web site:<br />

<p><strong>Since the above program is what I would call "Latched" (opened in task mamanger but hanging) it is listing the above in the event viewer and has been going on and on. I have a total of 80 of the above events while posting this reply. (System sub

<p><strong>I am up for a good challenge , but this issue has me stumped. What would cause this and again a correction ? Preventative measure would be also be a great discussion piece.</strong></p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many problems are solved by getting the latest firmware for your Miracast adapter. We suggest that you visit the Support section of the manufacturer's website, search on your specific device, and follow their instructions to download and install that firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can also check the Windows Store to see if there's an app from the manufacturer of your Miracast adapter that updates firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you require further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>How to set up radio stations in Windows Media Player get error &#34;No - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debbiequesinberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set up radio stations in Windows Media Player get error &#34;No FM Signal&#34;</h2>
                    I have followed the steps for setting up windows media player and have been unsuccessful. I specifically would like to get a radio station and locate it on the desk top. A friend had it working at one time and I somehow deleted it and have tried repeatedly
 to retrieve it. I have done system recoveries without any success. When I do select music I get a message that states, "no FM signal". It had been working properly, the speakers work fine. I've tried everything I found on the internet to correct the problem.
 It's possible that I have put it in trash and need to retrieve it, I don't know. Any suggestions for restoration?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptops these days tend to try and save on power requirements by including two graphics cards in laptops. The Intel HD graphics might sound impressive, but it's the low end display unit and is just a chip on the motherboard. It's good enough to run things
 like flash video on Youtube and minor animations in web pages, but anything requiring high end graphics will use the main graphics card which will be dedicated with its own memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking, a laptop with at least an Intel i5 processor will have a dedicated nVidia graphics card with its own memory onboard, but anything less such as an Intel i3 or an Atom processor should be avoided if you want to play medium to high end games.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the game's official minimum system requirements, but a new version of Minecraft for Windows 10 is due to be released shortly and the requirements to run that are unknown at this time:

<p>just bought elite bundle a few days ago and the controller is already bad read other posts about returning to retailer but my local gamestop has no more so I spent 500 dollars on this system I hope it can be resolved quickly. the whine is so&nbsp;high pitched
 and loud you can hear it in the next room it is driving me crazy I may take whole system back for a&nbsp;refund and go back to my old xboxone which I was still using original controller that had absolutely no problems at all&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there bobbibob.</p>
<p>Definitely a strange sound to be hearing from your controller and definitely not normal. If it's a constant noise I definitely recommend either an exchange at the retailer you purchased from. If they don't have any available for an exchange your next best option is to set up a repair/replacement over on our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>.</p>
<p>Definitely want you to have a fully functioning controller ASAP. Really sorry to hear this is happening for you.</p>

<p>hi all,</p>

</p>
<p>I got today my new laptop but windows 8 was preinstalled.</p>
<p>so i give it a try now i just wanna remove a few things.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First that right side tap, no clue what they call it, the one with "search" in it.</p>
<p>I wanna have it gone, removed or uninstalled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>second, how do get back the start button?, i find it very unorganized the way this windows works, like a bag of icons put together, and tussled anything around.&nbsp; *will be even better if this whole *title i think it's called to be removed* and just load into
 the basic old fashion desktop style.</p>
<p>*if possible*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thank you,</p>
<p>for the help you can provide.<br />

 care about the menu, you can get Windows 8.1, which is in beta release right now.&nbsp; If you need the menu, there are a few third-party alternatives, including Start8 and&nbsp;ClassicShell.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Canvio 2TB Cloud external drive...PC won&#39;t recognize or let me map it</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Canvio 2 TB external cloud. &nbsp;I set it up using an HP laptop. &nbsp;Everything went fine. &nbsp;Then i went through mapping it has a drive to make it easier to use and it went fine. &nbsp;I was able to do the same process on my other laptop. &nbsp;I have been
 trying for 2 days to do the same thing on my HP TouchSmart 420 with no luck. &nbsp;I have uninstalled the original software multiple times. &nbsp;I have removed it from the devices list. &nbsp;I have restored my computer back to an earlier date in. &nbsp;Nothing will fix the
 situation. &nbsp;The&nbsp;computer sees the canvio...but i can't access files on it&nbsp;from&nbsp;my desktop and i can't map to it as a drive. &nbsp;Every time i try to start over and windows "installs" the drive i get a message that says the installation failed because windows could
 not find a driver. &nbsp;There&nbsp;is no driver for the external drive. &nbsp;The&nbsp;other two computers are working just fine with it would appreciate any guidance anyone can provide.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to mind is to ask what file system your HP laptop is formatted in? If its not NTSF or exFat, then a drive that large won't be recognized. Only those file systems can recognize drives 2TB in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that's the case, you'll need to backup your hard drive externally with something it can recognize, and then reformat the drive as either an NTSF or exFat formatted drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps you out. Please let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Can changing computers affect a Toshiba Desktop External Hard Drive, I went through the whole set up on a laptop than I put it in another laptop to edit videos (as one has the vids the other has the software to edit them).</p>
<p>Does changing computer do something to it. I plug it into a power point and a usb3.0 slot, the lights come on but I get an error saying that the device could not be recognised.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks </p>
<p>Wallace</p>

            <p>Hello Wallace,</p>
<p>A USB 3.0 slot? Is the drive USB 3.0? Is the computer USB 3.0? A 3.0 drive should work on any laptop that is backwards compatible - are both your drive and computer backwards compatible? Like to a 2.0?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That may in fact be your problem. Unless the drive and computer are backwards compatible, you are going to have a problem. What is the exact model of drive and laptop do you have? And, what specific model are you trying to get the drive to work with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could respond with the answers I might be able to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>
