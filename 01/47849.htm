                    <p>I've logged into XBOX beta and can play Microsoft Solitaire Collection daily challenge.
</p>
<p>I have also downloaded Jigsaw, Mahjong and Sudoku. I've tried to load these using Xbox after logging in the&nbsp;games start to load and quits on the log in page. The log in page shows that I'm not logged in. I have uninstalled and reinstalled these games. I

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device
 so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer
 to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling the Microsoft virtual network adapter, I can't find it anymore here to update/enable it. I even reset the PC(without deleting the files) and it didn't help me either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d66188ee-95de-4a11-93a5-b782ea3c1501" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtual Machine Network Driver for Microsoft Device Emulator link you've given me redirects me to Microsoft's Virtual PC 2007.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's a Microsoft driver, I don't think I would find it in the manufacturer's website too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my only solution is to perform a clean install of windows again? If I do so, will my problem be fixed? The reason I had to fiddle with the driver is because I was getting BSOD whenever I try to host a virtual network. (I never had this problem when I
 was using Windows 8.1)</p>

            <p>If you were trying to run a previous virtual machine, you will have to update from VPC to Hyper-V manager.&nbsp; Go to Start | All Apps | Windows Administrative Tools | Hyper-V manager.&nbsp; Then read the help files.&nbsp; You probably need to set up a new Virtual Switch
 to connect the virtual machines and you may need to reactivate your previous machines.&nbsp; See this forum where the experts on Hyper-V in Win10 are:&nbsp;

    <title>impossible to close My Documents, the window keeps reopening and is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikitaghosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            impossible to close My Documents, the window keeps reopening and is always in foreground, can&#39;t use other programme</h2>
                    I have a serious problem with the windows explorer. It keeps opening in "My Documents" and it is impossible closing it. I can close it but it immediately reopens within seconds - not enough time to click anywhere else.
<br />
<br />
It is also locked in the foreground so that I cannot use any other programme, the cursor immediately switches back to My Documents as the active window. I cannot even go to Start - Run- or Start - logoff or anything because as soon as I click anywhere the active
 window is my documents again. <br />
<br />
I am not sure what happened but I think my 1 year old pressed some weird key combination when she was playing with my laptop. It's not a virus because I have run a full Kaspersky scan and everything seems fine. It all works fine in the safe mode as well. It's
 only when i go into the "unsafe" mode I have this problem. I have tried looking at the registry key as some similar issues on these forums pointed to it, but I cannot find any userinit registry key. What can I do please?

<h2>            Windows 10 restore to earlier time failure</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on my laptop. Installation went OK but then problems. Wifi was randomly getting turned off, Skype click to call was disabled as was Avast online security. On checking these extensions there was no button present to re-enable.just
 a message saying disabled (with 8.1 I never had these problems). I decided I would restore to earlier time ie to the date of 10 installation and try to see what had changed to create the problems.Two restore points were offered so I chose the first. Laptop

<h2>            DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I always have problems with boot up of Windows. Sometimes it is very slow. Even when I suspend it, if I resume after a lot of time it can crash and I am forced to cut power and restart. This happens also everytime I switch on after a suspension + switch
 off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last times I have registered even two blue screen. this are the details:</p>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

            <p>There are both technical and contractual considerations.&nbsp; I also use my phone for my PC's internet connection, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Tethering mobile phone to computer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Technical</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; USB connection [what you are doing already]</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.1&nbsp; To connect the phone to the PC using the phone's MicroUSB-USB cable, you would normally have to install the phone's drivers on the PC.&nbsp; All phone makers supply drivers but they might be integrated within their sync software rather than as separate files
 so you would have to follow the instructions for using that even though you might never want to&nbsp;use the sync software itself.&nbsp; Your phone's handbook, your phone maker's support site &amp; its support forums are bound to give you suitable advice for doing this
 task.&nbsp; If the drivers exist as separate downloads from the support website then you can keep things simple by only installing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.2&nbsp; Go to the phone and into its settings.&nbsp; Somewhere in there will be a set of entries for mobile network sharing ["tethering"].&nbsp; Make sure you have selected the entry for sharing the mobile phone's network connection [rather than the other way round -
 which would normally be called "Internet pass-through"].&nbsp; You might find that your phone has a setting for automatically deciding which of these it needs so you might prefer that if you intend to work the other way round on occasion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; WiFi hotspot connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.1&nbsp; If you have a "WiFi hotspot" capability on your phone then switching that on creates a "WiFi Access point" that a WiFi-enabled computer can detect and connect to.&nbsp; If you then switch on the phone's data connection [the same&nbsp;one you'd use for the phone
 to use the internet] then that WiFi Access point will give other devices the ability to connect through the phone to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.2&nbsp; Look in the settings for your phone to find the WiFi hotspot connection details&nbsp;- the hotspot&nbsp;will have an SSID [a name] and a password.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.3&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;your computer TaskBar's network icon then select the network that has that SSID [name], enter the password and you should connect to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.4&nbsp; You would not normally have to alter&nbsp;the settings [see para 1.2 above] for the computer to be connected straight through to the internet this way as it's part of the way WiFi hotspots are set up.&nbsp; It would not hurt to look in settings&nbsp;but I don't think
 you will find that you need to do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.5&nbsp; As soon as you are confident with the setup, go back to the phone and change both the SSID [name] and password because hackers&nbsp;are able to exploit the default ones that phone makers put in.&nbsp; Then repeat the 2.1 - 2.4 procedure with these new parameters.&nbsp;
 This time, you can set the checkbox you'll see on the computer for "Connect automatically" so you can, in the future, just turn things on and let them sort themselves out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Connecting through your local network</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.1&nbsp; If you have a network router then you might be able to use the phone's USB cable and / or its WiFi hotspot and / or its own WiFi capability to connect your router's network to the phone for internet use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I know nothing about routers and have never tried any of these methods so am not fit to advise you about them.&nbsp; All I know is that some other people have things set up this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Contractual</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ISP's only allow the mobile device itself to connect to the internet.&nbsp; Some of them have payment plans that allow computers to use the data connection as well - ISPs&nbsp;use the term&nbsp;"tethering" to mean both USB cable connections and WiFi hotspot connections.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.2&nbsp; You need to find out if your ISP allows your computer to use the connection.&nbsp; So you need to check the terms &amp; conditions to make sure you are allowed to tether - you might find the info easily or it might be buried in a "fair use" policy statement
 or a "network traffic management policy" statement.&nbsp; If your ISP does not allow tethering then you might find that the connection gets slowed down or blocked - you might even find that your account gets suspended.&nbsp; It's also possible that an ISP states that
 it does not allow tethering but then does nothing about it so you could abuse the contract to use tethering without incident [but you'd only find that out by trying it and seeing what happens - if they monitor for tethering then you might be penalised].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.3&nbsp; If you have a "fair use" policy on your ISP's internet connection then you might find that tethering your computer to the phone eats through your data allowance quicker than you could imagine.&nbsp; You need to consider both the internet use you are aware
 of and the other things that happen automatically without your direct knowledge - Windows &amp; application updates, subscriptions to customer feedback programmes etc.&nbsp; There are several examples in WMP alone so look in&nbsp;WMP, Options, Privacy tab for the setting
 "WMP customer experience improvement program" [look around the other WMP options and you'll see several more items that involve background internet data usage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.4&nbsp; Mobile data connection price plan prices vary enormously.&nbsp; So do warning systems for exceeding the data allowance.&nbsp; I was with one ISP that sent warning texts at 80% then at 100% of data usage &amp; actually interrupted my web browsing with a webpage explaining
 the situation so I would not incur excess use charges without deliberately deciding to do so.&nbsp; I later switched price plans with that same&nbsp;ISP without checking the details and I found that I was charged extra because the new price plan did not include these
 warnings.&nbsp; I've changed to another one that does issue warnings and I&nbsp;intend to stay.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this has answered your question.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Yes, if your computer has a wireless communication device that's compatible with whatever wireless technology is used by your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, Apple permits you to tether an iPad to an iPhone using either or both wi-fi or Bluetooth, both of which are wireless communication technologies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that your mobile phone permits tethering using wi-fi, then your computer must have a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; Almost all laptops sold today have one of these built in.&nbsp; Most desktop/tower systems do not, but such an adapter can be purchased relatively
 inexpensively.&nbsp; It can either be external (some USB wi-fi adapters look very much like typical USB flash drives) or it can be an internal card (like a video or audio card).&nbsp; The latter, of course, can only be used if the computer has an available internal
 connector (usually called a "slot").</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use Bluetooth (a short-range wireless technology), your computer needs a Bluetooth adapter.&nbsp; Again, most laptops will have this and most desktop/towers will require the purchase of such an adapter.</p>

 It is not compatible on Windows 10. I wish and hope they will update it for all the old gamers. It is too bad I cannot finish this part of my game because of a retarded error! Please fix this soon Windows people!</span>

<h2>            Upgrade from Win7 to Win10 dislikes my Epson Stylus Photo R200 Printer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd been using successfully and for a long time an Epson Stylus Photo R200 on my HP desktop PC with Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once&nbsp;I had accepted the online upgrade to Win10, this printer is no longer functional. I mean, the printer is not itself broken, only that it won't work with my Win10 computer now..</p>

</p><p>(FWIW, I recall watching&nbsp;my monitor during the upgrade and there were one or two instances where a fleeting message said something to the effect of, "We are removing this software from your computer because it is incompatible with Windows 10." The messages
 were not stored anywhere for me to review, and they came and went almost instantly before I could ingest them, so I have no idea what was removed (the nerve!) but then this R200 printer stopped&nbsp;working&nbsp;with my&nbsp;PC so it was a casualty of the upgrade process.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer is cabled to my computer, not wireless. I can disconnect the cable and my PC recognizes this with&nbsp;the expected&nbsp;downbeat
<em>BUH-Buh</em> sound, and when I reconnect it, my computer sees that too, with&nbsp;the upbeat<em> buh-BUH
</em>sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Devices and Printers, it appears with the generic "USB Printer" ID instead of the old specific ID "Epson Stylus Photo R200" and if I right click on it, I do not have a choice to make it the default printer. I did see an option to&nbsp;"uninstall" the printer
 but&nbsp;did not attempt that because I feared I would be making the matter worse, I dunno.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to print something,&nbsp;this printer&nbsp;does not appear on the list of printer choices and, even though this Print process allows&nbsp;for a new printer to be added at this time, when I click to do that, I get a honk noise and a pop-up saying, "The Active Directory
 Domain Services is currently unavailable." I recognize this may be a separate and unrelated issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This R200 printer does, however, appear in Device Manager but in its own little section for "Other Devices" under which it appears as "EpsonStylus Photo R200" (EpsonStylus is one word, FWIW). I can right click on it there and select "Update Driver Software"
 to have it search online. It does find a driver, it says it's downloading it then installing it, but then it fails, with this message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Epson Stylus Photo R200 (M)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unable to find a core driver package for your device but encountered&nbsp; an error while attempting to install it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, that last statement almost makes no sense to me. Is it saying it tried to install a package<em> that it did not find</em>? Did not find... where? On my computer? That's the only place it could mean that would make that statement make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I digressed, I suppose. Anyway, I have no idea what&nbsp;a "core driver package" is, or where to look on my hard drive to see if it is there or not. If that package&nbsp;is something that requires a reinstall from the CD that came with my printer, I've searched
 my house high and low and cannot find that CD. The Epson website states if they have any CD's left, I can call (California telephone number) to request one. I called and got someone overseas who only knew how to tell me to download a driver from online.<em>
 "Is there anything else I can help you with?" </em>Sheesh. When I specifically asked them for a copy of the original CD, they referred me to their tech support. First of all, it is my ignorant assumption that&nbsp;this CD is this core drive package thing. Second
 of all, already the Epson website is passing me around like a whiskey bottle. So, before I chase down a CD that may not even be the solution, I thought I would write this novella here and hope anybody can recognize if this is more of a Win10 compatibility
 thing than a missing&nbsp;Epson file, and maybe then explain what I need to do, in step-by-step language. The R200 is really a nice printer and I still have lots of ink cartridges for it. I'd hate to have to retire it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

it's a 2004 printer<br />
the only drivers listed on the Epson site are for XP and older<br />
<br />
however, Win Vista, Win 7, Win8.x&nbsp; have basic functionality "inbox" or "windows update" print drivers
<br />
<br />
if your system was win 7 &gt; win 10 in place over top upgrade then <br />
<br />
in device manager <br />
right click the printer<br />
&gt; uninstall<br />
then unplug it from the USB port and reboot<br />
<br />
after reboot<br />
plug it back into the USB port<br />
it should be detected and the correct inbox drivers installed<br />
<br />
if it doesn't detect it as new hardware found and install inbox drivers <br />
then MS has either nuked support<br />
or there is some other problem with the win 10 installation<br />

            <p>Thank for your reply. I performed these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>in device manager </em><br />
<em>right click the printer</em><br />
<em>&gt; uninstall</em><br />
<em>then unplug it from the USB port and reboot</em><br />
<br />
<em>after reboot</em><br />
<em>plug it back into the USB port</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the upbeat buh-BUH when I plugged it back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I expected an immediate&nbsp;pop-up or something to indicate a specific recognition. Never got one, even after 10 minutes of waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Devices and Printers, once again&nbsp;it appears with the generic "USB Printer" ID and cannot be made default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, once again the R200 is there, in its own folder "Other Devices". Once again, I right-click on it, select "Update Driver Software", it searches and again gives me that same
<strong>boldified&nbsp;</strong>response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Print process again gives me that possibly unrelated honk and message, "The Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it appears it is the same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Epson site does let me search on the R200 model for drivers but merely states:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Description :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p><em>Windows 10 drivers for this product are installed automatically when you power-on and connect your printer to your Windows 10 computer."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, no, they aren't. Sigh.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I deleted the generic printer icon that was in Devices and Printers and that was labeled with that generic "USB Printer" ID. This deletion of this icon&nbsp;here was the first time I have deleted it, FWIW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the R200&nbsp;by right-clicking&nbsp;where it appeared in Device Manager. The "Other Devices" folder that it was in disappeared as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set Print Spooler to Manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;did WinKey+R, entered&nbsp;appwiz.cpl and, incidentally,&nbsp;saw the same&nbsp;results I get whenever I select
<strong>Control Panel&gt;Programs and Features</strong>. On this display of programs, I saw nothing else there to remove related to this R200 printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged my R200 at&nbsp;its USB connection and noted I did <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> hear the downbeat BUH-buh sound. I'm pretty sure I didn't hear it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted the computer, plugged in the R200 at the USB, heard the upbeat buh-BUH sound, watched the Other Devices section reappear on the&nbsp;Device Manager list with&nbsp;"EpsonStylus Photo R200" in it. Within a minute, the generic printer icon "USB Printer" reappeared
 in Devices and Printers. FWIW, I right-clicked on&nbsp;that icon&nbsp;and still no option to make it a default printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's different this time is what happened when I went to Device Manager&gt;Other Devices, right-clicked on the "EpsonStylus Photo R200" and again selected "Update Driver Software" to have it search online. This time, I got a different response in the last
 statement as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Epson Stylus Photo R200 (M)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One of the installers for this device cannot perform the installation at this time.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped at this point to compose this response to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please know I have left Print Spooler set to Manual at this point. (It&nbsp;had been set to Automatic before I changed it.) Whoever advises next, if not you, should address what I would do with this setting in any next (or different) advice.</p>

            <p><span>My problem is now&nbsp;fixed. My Epson Stylus Photo R200 is printing from my Win10 desktop computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here's what happened. I had contacted Epson via their website interface and their reply said this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Unfortunately, Epson no longer provides a driver for this printer model on a Windows 10 computer. However, you may check if there's an in-box driver available from your operating system. But please be informed that this driver has limited functionality.
 Please follow the steps below:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>1) </span><span>Control Panel&gt;Devices and Printers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>2) Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Add a printer</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>3) If it doesn't automatically find your printer,&nbsp;click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
The printer that I want isn't listed.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>4) Select: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>5) </span></strong><span><strong>Follow the steps.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Well,&nbsp;I had to first go turn my Print Spooler back to Automatic and reboot my computer to make this work, then with my printer turned on, I got through Step 4. Step 5 asked me to select a port and it defaulted to
<strong>LPT1: (Printer Port)</strong>.&nbsp; I assumed LPT1 was ok, so I left it that way. It then asked me to select my printer model and offered three versions of the R200. I guessed at the latest R200 version and the computer came back to say that a driver is
 already installed for this printer (it must have been resident on my computer or maybe it appeared when Microsoft previously went a-searching.) It also asked if I had my CD,
</span>which I didn't,<span> in case I wanted to select the driver from it,&nbsp;so instead I&nbsp;let this process select&nbsp;whatever driver that it saw, and then it nicely added the printer icon to Devices and Printers&nbsp;and this time it was correctly&nbsp;labeled as&nbsp;"</span>Epson
 Stylus Photo R200 (M)" instead of "USB Printer" and it&nbsp;was marked&nbsp;as the default printer, as I requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, anything I printed went into the print queue and stayed there with an error message "Error - Printing". I googled for this error and found&nbsp;someone's&nbsp;general comment on the sevenforums site:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Choose the correct port for e.g. mine were on LPT 1 but my printers are connected via USB - so choose the USB001, USB002, etc port by ticking on the box by the side of the port.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Heck, my R200 is USB. I have nothing to lose, so I removed the printer from Devices and Printers and started over again, but this time I selected</span><span>&nbsp;<strong>USB0001
</strong>and not LPT1 as my port.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Success.</strong> I can print to my printer now. I</span><span>t appears on Devices and Printers with the ID I expected,
</span><span>"</span>Epson Stylus Photo R200 (M)"<span>, I can mark it as my default printer, and it prints what I send to it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It may take&nbsp;doing some&nbsp;printing for a while, to see if there is any&nbsp;<em>limited functionality
</em>like Epson had&nbsp;cautioned&nbsp;me that there may be. However, I can't say for certain if the driver I used is one of the "inbox drivers", whatever that means exactly, or was already resident on my computer from my CD that I can no longer&nbsp;find.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reflecting back over&nbsp;Epson's solution, it was right there all along, to manually add this. I guess that initial error message
<em>"Unable to find a core drive package"</em>&nbsp;took my thinking far&nbsp;away from the idea of this manual option. Next time, I'll know about this manual option to add older printers.</span></p>

            <p>good news then <br />
(°ö°)<br />
<br />
the windows "inbox" drivers for various hardware is still actually provided by the device Mfg.
<br />
it's only limitation is usually that it's not officially supported for full functionality<br />
<br />
limited functionality usually means extras / extra software doesn't work or can't be installed<br />
eg.<br />
monitoring the ink levels <br />
saving settings <br />
etc.<br />

            <p>I used to have a PC running XP</p>
<p>I just bought a new computer with Windows 7 professional 64 bit</p>
<p>I have been trying to transfer my software from the old PC to the new PC and I have had a lot of trouble</p>
<p>One of the problems is that I get this error message when trying to install some of the programs</p>
<p>"This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package"</p>
<p>Another problem is that&nbsp;Windows 7 Device Manager refuses to recognise that I have installed the driver for my old scanner even though I have run the install program</p>
<p>I oprder to get over these problems I have resorted to installing Windows XP on a virtual machine and run all the programs I cannot&nbsp; install in Windows 7,on XP.</p>
<p>I tried running the troubleshooter&nbsp;before I understood that I could install XP, but it crashed</p>
<p>I also ran a <span>sfc /scannow (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>) and got a file with a few errors which I did not try to correct.</span></p>
<p><span>The end result is that I now have most of my programs running, some in 7 and some in XP. It is not ideal but it is the best I can do by myself</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this answers your questions and if you have any solutions to getting all my programs onto 7 I would be grateful</span></p>

            Hi Andrew,<br />
assuming the programs that you were able to install on Win7 didn't give you that same error, we can start with they are probably not compatible.<br />
But you can go to the web page and check just to make sure:<br />
<p><b><span>Windows 7 Compatibility Center</span></b><span><br />
</span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></p>
<p>One think we may try is try installing from safe mode first, then see if we can boot normal.
<br />
</p>
<p>I guess we need to go program by program.</p>
<p>How many are they talking, and do we always get the same issue.</p>
<p>Eddie b<br />

<h2>            whea_uncorrectable_error windows 8.1 BSOD - HELP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer: HP Paviion 500-319a</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop is less&nbsp;than 4 weeks old&nbsp;and I&nbsp;am consistently getting whea_uncorrectable_error&nbsp; blue screen, its getting more frequent over the last few days. I actually had a post written and I got it again. I thought it might happen when I have lots of apps
 running at once but it also happens when I have very little running too. If you do not already know, I get the blue screen and my PC reboots itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started looking myself for causes and resolutions, a lot of cases are different with this error so I am going to detail mine and hope someone can help me here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They say it could be a hardware problem, computer is brand new, I have ran chkdsk and also sfc / scan now as administrator in command prompt, all comes back ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There is some talk that skype on win 8.1 is a cause, I have just uninstalled, after uninstalling skype an hour ago it happened again so I presume I can rule out this Skype rumour floating around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have checked my Event Viewer to see what messages I am getting leading up to this system crash and the following seem to be quite consistent and I was wondering if you could look and advise how I can resolve please:</p>

</p><p>Finally I see some people saying its over clocking or a bios problem where this should be updated but I really am not sure and was looking for advise.

<p>
</p><p>It seems to me via&nbsp;Event Viewer&nbsp;&nbsp;on my pc that this problem first occurred on 18/09/14, I did not install any new software on this exact date. I&nbsp;downloaded something to run stress tests which I will do before I go to bed but since the problem is occurring
 all the time and not&nbsp;consistent with me running multiple apps I am not sure how useful it will be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciated some help with this as I can not work on my computer when this keeps&nbsp;happening, I need full connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<em>"Stop code 0×124 WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR&nbsp; mostly refers to Hardware related failure very rarely we get false positives. But I would say around 90% of the time it’s Hardware. WHEA means Windows Hardware Error Architecture. Since it’s Hardware related it’s
 difficult to troubleshoot, to know which hardware is failing. There are number of ways we could find out but like I said it’s a little hard and it’s time consuming process. So in this article we’ll discuss how to approach Stop code 0×124"</em></p>

<h2>            Remote desktop user account password has expired</h2>
                    <p>I have been remoting into my desktop from my notebook.&nbsp; My desktop uses my O365 account.&nbsp; This has been working great.&nbsp; However, I just started to receive this message on the remote client - notebook - "The user account's password has expired.&nbsp; The password
 must change in order to logon.&nbsp; Please update the password..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the desktop, the account is fine.&nbsp; If I logon to the O365 portal, the password is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fairly confident that the password is ok.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on this?</p>

<p>You did not specify a local account but a Microsoft account instead. It seems there is a need for you to become familiar with your local accounts and their password expiry settings. You can do it like so:</p>

<p>I had this same problem and I fixed it by trying a few different things. I hope I can describe the exact steps I took.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to the computer that will not let you log in remotely.</p>
<p>2) log in at that computer (not remote) using your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>3) Find the application "Computer Management".</p>
<p>4) In the computer management application, in the left panel, click "System Tools"</p>
<p>5) click "Local Users and Groups"</p>
<p>6) click "Users"</p>
<p>7) A list of users will show in the right panel of the application.</p>
<p>8) Find the user that looks like your Microsoft account. It won't say Microsoft account on it, but look for the account that has the same user name.</p>
<p>9) Right-click on that account name.</p>
<p>10) A "Properties" window will pop-up</p>
<p>11) The "General" tab should be showing</p>
<p>12) Un-check the box "User must change password at next login".</p>
<p>13) Check the box "Password never expires".</p>
<p>14) Make sure the other boxes are NOT checked.</p>
<p>15) Click "Okay".</p>
<p>16) The "Properties" window should disappear</p>
<p>17) Close the "Computer Management" application by clicking the X in the upper right corner, or by using "File --&gt; Exit".</p>
<p>18) Go back to the computer from which you were trying to launch remote desktop</p>
<p>19) Remote desktop should work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me. I hope it works for you.</p>

            <p>You need to export using the desktop version of Windows Mail (the one first built for Windows 7, but still available for Windows 8 too).&nbsp; Here you go:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://get.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">desktop version of Windows Live Mail</a>&nbsp;(part of the Windows Essentials package).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Open the Windows Live Mail program and add your email account.&nbsp; It will sync to show all the same emails as the Mail app does.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Choose File &gt; Export and you can export the email.</li></ol>
<p>When you're done you can remove the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OR -- you can just skip that entirely and add the account to your Microsoft Outlook 2013.&nbsp; It will also download all the mail from the server.</p>

    <title>Hacked Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farmer thompson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked Account</h2>
                    
<p>I was told this would be the best place to post by Xbox Support...<br />
<br />
So. Last year my account was hacked. A load of my achievements were unlocked (By a modding tool I presume) by said hacker(s), ruining my gaming experience and creating no point to play a lot of video-games I had purchased but not yet completed.<br />
<br />
The hacking continued through 2014, for example, a few months ago an abundance of purchases were made on my card, but luckily the escalation team were able to carry out an investigation, and recover my account from said hacking(s).<br />
<br />
However, the problem is a lot of my achievements still remain hacked open. A lot of them are on-line, and appear as "Unlocked offline." Because of this I receive messages of "Hacker," "Cheater," etc', and also fear one day my account will be banned, since some
 messages talk of reporting me. As said also, a lot of games I had yet to complete or play properly were ruined for me.
<br />
<br />
There was achievements I did get legit, such as all of Fall of Cybertron's and Sonic CD's. Achievements I am proud of that are tainted because of these people. So in conclusion, I was wondering if
<em>anything</em> could be done. Even if it meant resetting all of my offline achievements, I wouldn't mind. I'm just sick of the abuse and the feeling of owning a hacked account. And of course again, the wasted games. I don't see much point in starting a new
 account since there's also my ranks I worked hard on getting such as on Halo: Reach (General Grade 4... Which took me a good three years to get to!) Again. So much work I've put into gaming, feels like it's gone to waste because of a bunch of idiots with nothing
 better to do than hack people (And probably mod themselves).<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope this can be somehow fixed.</p>

<p>Firstly why would a game be wasted for you if a "hacker" unlocked some achievements? &nbsp; It's about the game not the little badges at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Secondly if your story is true the only way to remedy the situation would be to abandon that account and start fresh, but I'm guessing you won't do that because of your legit Cheevos.</p>

<p>The chances of your account actually being "hacked" are extremely small indeed.</p>
<p>If by this small chance your account was hacked then why wait so long to report it?</p>
<p>There is no way to reset certain achievements,you will have them all reset &amp; won't be able to re earn any reset achievements on that account.</p>
<p>They have now started banning/suspending accounts with modded Gamerscore as well.</p>
<p>Like Genchy said,your better off starting a new account.</p>

<p>"The chances of your account actually being "hacked" are extremely small indeed."</p>
<p>Right. So I thought after three years of legit gaming, hey, you know what would be fun? Modding my profile and having the hard work and money I put in it for nothing as it's banned!</p>
<p>"If by this small chance your account was hacked then why wait so long to report it?"</p>
<p>Re-Read what I said. I reported it every single time something dodgy happened with it. Each time the problem was solved. This thread I created is for the achievements still being unlocked.</p>
<p>"Firstly why would a game be wasted for you if a "hacker" unlocked some achievements? It's about the game not the little badges at the end of the day."</p>
<p>It's not just that. Because there are games that have in-game profiles with stats which arise suspicion. As I said. People see on-line achievements with "Unlocked Offline." The first thing they'll think is. "Modded. Best report it."</p>

<p>Your correct your account looks dodgy as a dodgy thing living in Dodge City. &nbsp; Your only option is a fresh start. &nbsp; Looking at your 100% games it looks like this was a long term thing or are you saying that all your 100% games were hacked and unlocked overnight?</p>

<p>Sorry but something isn't right here,like I said,the chances of your account actually being hacked are extremely small but for it to happen several times &amp; mainly only to mess with your achievements doesn't sound right.</p>
<p>No matter,the result will be the same so you are better of starting a new profile,it's the only way you will be able to re earn any achievements.</p>

<p>Small chance doesn't mean there is none. My account got hacked 3 times! The first time my name got changed to tinker it, and I had to beg Xbox to let me change it back. The second time purchases was made such as games being bought and the final time I couldn't
 get into my account and it was also deleted off my Xbox. Luckily this has all stopped now, but if it's an on going thing for you I'd say start a new profile completely with a new email address, the email address may be the problem and how they seem to be getting
 in. I understand how frustrating it is when they are spending your hard earned cash on *** you don't want. I would also advise taking your card off after paying for live.

<p>Ouch if the OP was genuinly hacked then that sucks. But as i said something dodgy is going on, i know hackers are usually peopel trying to find something to do with their hands in between w**k sessions but even i doubt someone would hack an account just
 to up the gamerscore.</p>

            <p>The days of Service Packs are behind us and can no longer be used as a measure of quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What does Windows as a Service entail?</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Security Updates, Features and Fixes are automatically applied.</li><li>There is no option to delay or customize these updates.</li></ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 Home</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>CBB includes the requirements of the Current Branch, but also provides the option of customizing when and which Security Updates, Features and Fixes are applied, similar to how Windows Update works today in current versions of Windows.&nbsp;</li><li>Updates cannot be deferred indefinitely.</li><li>Windows Updates can be managed using enterprise management tools such as Windows Update for Business and/ WSUS.</li></ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 Pro</li><li>Windows 10 Enterprise </li><li>Windows 10 Education</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Only available to volume license customers running Windows 10 Enterprise.</li><li>Flexible options for managing Windows Updates.</li><li>Windows Updates can be customized to only accept Security Fixes.</li><li>Windows Updates can be managed using enterprise management tools such as Windows Update for Business and/ WSUS.</li></ul>

<li>Windows 10 Enterprise </li></ul>

As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense

            <p>The problem with that, for those of us who prefer Windows 7 is that there is now, without service packs and their related description pages, no way to find out if Windows 10 has been fixed.</p>
<p>I have tried Windows 10, but the white header on every window, the barely usable dvd player that needs to be restarted and the dvd ejected reinserted and searched for where you were when you paused the dvd to get a drink or use the rest room, the inability
 to place seldom used programs in the start menu without the ridiculous tiles, having to search the list to find anything because you can't list it in the start menu unless it's a recently used program or a tile, having to (if you use the tiles) search through
 pages of them, no way to make customized&nbsp;themes or change the&nbsp;sounds or icons on the desktop, no way to delay downloading updates while running an mmo, no way to make your desktop look like a desktop and not look like a giant smart phone, slowing down every
 single program because Windows 10 is looking for updates 24/7, and a slew of other problems that make Windows 10 unusable.</p>

            <p>While there will no longer be Service Packs by that name, there will continue to be 'lines in the sand' that serve the same purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10, the first 'line in the sand' will probably be the Redstone upgrade, which is supposed to be delivered by the summer of 2016. This major upgrade is supposed to provide many features that are currently missing in Windows 10, like support for
 extensions in Edge and expanded media playing capabilities. Between now and then there will be regular bug fixing updates through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As crazy as this sounds, Microsoft is no longer saying what improvements or new features are included in Windows Updates. Now it's all a big secret.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with you. In my opinion, most should wait until after Redstone before thinking about installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will become difficult to do if Microsoft carries through with its announced plans. In 2016, Microsoft will mark the Windows 10 installer as a Recommended update in Windows Update. For Windows 7 and 8 users who are configured to install updates automatically,
 and get Recommended updates "the same way I receive important updates," Windows 10 will install automatically without any advance notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what Microsoft VP Terry Myerson calls 'helping people to discover Windows 10.' You can understand now why he decided to take most of 2016 off to spend time with his family.</p>

<div>Hi guys,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping someone can throw me a bone here,since I don't know which way to go with this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically, power surge last night, my PC now goes into an endless reboot cycle whenever turned on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot start it in safe mode, as it hangs on the list of files. Can't start in Last known good, can't boot from CD, as it will get as far as 'Checking hardware configuration' and then reboot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So essentially I can do nothing at all. I guess it's obvious some hardware is fried, but I can't afford to replace things at random- any suggestions on likely causes, or ways I can narrow it down?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi <strong>KevTM</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to <strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure </strong>
and check for the error message.</p>
<p>Prevents Windows from automatically restarting if an error causes Windows to fail. Choose this option only if Windows is stuck in a loop where Windows fails, attempts to restart, and fails again repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>To do that, follow the steps provided below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow these steps to start Windows in Safe mode: </strong></p>
<p>a. Click Start power button<br />
b. To get into the Windows xp advanced bootup option.<br />
c. When the computer is booting press and hold your <strong>"F8 Key</strong>" which should bring up the "<strong>Windows Advanced Options Menu</strong>".<br />
d. Use your arrow key to move to "<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong>" and press your Enter key.</p>
<p>Here you need to check the error message or error code you are receiving.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Try disconnecting all the external devices connected to the computer except mouse and keyboard and try to start the computer and check.</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate you are trying to help me, but as I said in my opening post I 'fixed' this by uninstalling an optional update.</p>
<p>As this occurred on three different machines and could be corrected on&nbsp;all &nbsp;machines by uninstalling this update my guess would be there is something wrong with the update.</p>

            Hi Boni.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.

<br />Also Panasonic has a one year repair and replacement warranty with chat of phone support so you can contact them.  Their Manual will also be on the Panasonic Support Downloads web page for your exact model.  So I would go there if the steps above don't help.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            People App account &#34;Attention Required&#34; for iCloud account</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I added my iCloud contacts to People and the setup never ended so I had to stop it. Now I have the attention required note on my iCloud account in People settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on it to try and edit the account settings I get the error message below. The connection and iCloud account are fine since I have iCloud drive configured and it is working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

</p><p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for posting this question on Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I see that you receive the error code 0x8024402c, while installing Mail, People, Messaging, Calendar and Yahoo Mail apps.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us work together to resolve this issue.<br />
However, we need more information on this issue to understand it better.</p>
<p>1.Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2.Do you use any proxy settings?<br />
3.Is the internet connection working properly?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the answers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try these steps and check if the issue is resolved.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Temporarily disable any anti-virus installed on the computer and install the apps.<br />
Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Reset Windows Store cache and check if the issue is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;The cache is a small data storage memory area accessed by your browser to access Web page data that is stored on the computer vs. having to re-download the data every time. The cache will be updated as soon as the webpage is visited.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to do so.</p>
<p>a.On the desktop, press Windows key + R to open the Run Dialog.<br />
b.Type wsreset.exe and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if you are able to download the apps from Windows Store now.<br />
Method 3: Disable any Proxy connections.<br />
a.Press "Windows key + R" and type "inetcpl.cpl" and press Enter. <br />
b.Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN Settings. <br />
c.Uncheck the option “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN”. <br />
d.Click "Apply" and "OK" to save changes.<br />
</p>

<p>I&nbsp;did not make any changes, I don't have a proxy setting, and yes my connection to iCloud is working - just cannot fix the "Attention Required" warning. By the way the error code is not 0x08024402c.

<p>I have the same problem as Kevin&nbsp;in MS People running Windows 10 Pro. My error code is
</p>
<span>
<p>0x801901f5 also. I tried to add my icloud account and I got this screen when I clicked on SYNC</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6001226-15f3-45f4-a1c9-9930a8308160" /></p>
<p>I don't really care about fixing the problem, but I would like to be able to DELETE this account from the list. I cannot find any way to delete the account since the ONLY screen I can access is the one above when&nbsp;I click on the account. You should also know
 that I have an iCloud account that DOES work, a Yahoo account and a Gmail account. They all work fine except for this one. Unfortunately your instructions to Kevin did not work at all&nbsp;for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short how do I delete an account that is listed but not accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Do you support people ever read the question? &nbsp;This answer has nothing to do with the People application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone actually working at microsoft any more? &nbsp;Ever since I installed windows 10 my computer won't go to sleep. &nbsp;You give me an as useless reply as this one. &nbsp;The people app will not let you delete the iCloud account once this error happens. &nbsp;It just
 gives you a 'problem' and then the completely useless hexadecimal error message. &nbsp; Did you guys fire all your UI engineers when you decided to make this free?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do anything to the iCloud account once this error occurs. &nbsp;People is a default application, resetting the store cache won't do jack to solve it.</p>

Trekkie-wp, Thank you! Your solution was so simple and elegant that I am dumbfounded by it! However, I am even more confused now by MS's inability to make any attempt at offering us an answer that made ANY sense. I also don't understand why the only solution
 open is this "backdoor" approach. Again, thanks for helping me out!

            I don't have iCloud configured to calendar.

            <p>I also had exactly the same problem and could fix it resetting the icloud account password the calendars account setting. (the idea to remove the account from there, drove me there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, the initial support answer seems to have nothing to do with the problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't know if you've managed to figure this one out yet, but for the benefit of anyone else that might come along with the same problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trekkie (below) was correct - if you have two-factor authentication active on your iCloud account, that's what's stopping you from successfully syncing your iCloud with your People/Calendar/Mail in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows doesn't prompt for the Apple 4 digit one-time code, you need to login to your Apple account at https://appleid.apple.com; click on "Manage your Apple ID".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to "Password and Security" and scroll down until you see "Generate an app-specific password". Click on that, and enter the details (I called mine "Windows 10"). Click on "Generate".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete any iCloud accounts you have on Windows 10 (they don't work anyway, right?). Set up a new iCloud account, but this time, use the password you just&nbsp;generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should work like a charm. Good luck!</p>

            I've been having the same problem, but I couldn't find that option in the options for "Password and Security"
