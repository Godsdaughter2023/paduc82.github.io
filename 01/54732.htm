<h2>            Gears Of War Ultimate Edition Key code</h2>
                    
<p>I was sent here from the Partner support service. &nbsp;I purchased the xbox one gears of war bundle with the gaerd of War Ultimate Edition download.. When I scratched off the key code for gears of war on the back of the card some of the key code also scratched
 off. I can not read some of the letters to enter the code. There is three codes on the back One if for the game and the other two are for special game skins. All three are missing some of the letters i cannot read them. What do I need to do to get these codes
 back.</p>

<p>Thank you Steve M.</p>

<h2>            Cannon Printer won&#39;t connect to laptop</h2>
                    I try to print and I get an error message "Printer is not responding". I have gone through the printer and it is connected to my network. I followed Cannon's website advice and it ends up telling me that there is a firewall issue that won't allow my printer
 and my computer to communicate. I have updated all downloads for my printer. How do I get around the firewall to enable my computer and printer to communicate?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If this is not a driver issue then there is a setting or hardware problem and you<br />
will need to contact Canon. More on the Firewall settings in the last section<br />
below though this may actually be a driver issue.<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

    <title>Black screen in headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason baginski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen in headset</h2>
                    <p>Long and the short of it.&nbsp; How do you get past the whole "mixed reality portal preview shows everything is fine but I'm just getting a black screen in my headset with the blinky light"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cyber monday special from Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming 7577 with a 1060MaxQ.&nbsp; Bought a Samsung HMD Odyssey from MS during the 12 days of Christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has immediate issues with the notebook as it wouldn't automatically update to the fall creators update. I had to download the media create tool and upgrade from there.&nbsp; Once there, I was able to attach my headset and got to play around a bit.&nbsp; My bosses
 new notebook came in, so I hooked it up to that machine and let him play around to see if he was interested in getting into the windows mixed reality universe.&nbsp; Attached it back to my machine and besides having to repair the controllers.&nbsp; Everything was working
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then my machine decided to try and pick up the latest insider build.&nbsp; It got stuck installing and was stuck in an endless loop of downloading 3+ GB, trying to install, then downloading the whole damned thing again.&nbsp; Tried to use my headset but the mixed
 reality portal wanted to download something and it couldn't because updates were stuck by this install I couldn't get rid of(I assumed I rolled the dice on being an insider and bowed out, but couldn't clear it from constantly trying to download it).&nbsp; After
 two days of trying every suggestion online, I gave up and did a factory reset on my machine(reset didn't work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is, after the factory reset, it was able to pull down and install the fall creators update properly.&nbsp; I then did all the dell/intel driver updates(including a bios update that came out today) and updated my nvidia drivers.&nbsp; Plugged in my headset,
 it downloaded what it needed.&nbsp; Paired the controllers.&nbsp; Then it pretended like everything was okay, except that the displays in my headset aren't coming on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the headset was tested on this piece of hardware and a second piece of hardware.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that means it's not defective and my notebook isn't defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I go from here?&nbsp; The whole purpose of buying this notebook was windows mixed reality.&nbsp; I was thrilled(when it worked) but I'm quickly souring on the experience.&nbsp; From what I see online, people are grabbing usb-c to hdmi adapters.&nbsp; I really want
 an explaination as to why I would need to do something like that when it was working previously(even if it wasn't, the specs say I shouldn't have to go to that extreme)</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possibles reasons why this issue occurs is due to an incompatible HDMI adapter. This can also be caused by an outdated or corrupted graphics driver. Since you mentioned that you have tested the headset with other devices, we suggest posting your

<p>I'll repost into the developer forum along with dxdiag info.&nbsp; I had read a ton of similar issues there with a lot of "I'm just going to return the headset" as the final outcome or purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter to bypass whatever crap is stopping it
 from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my post, my notebook(arrived two weeks ago, last week I picked up my headset) was functioning with this hdmi and usb port. &nbsp; I had to factory reset the machine after a failed insider preview install(which blocked the mixed reality portal
 from starting back up as it wanted to download something).&nbsp; Everything is completely fresh and all latest drivers installed.&nbsp; The port itself hasn't been damaged as I can still hook it to an external monitor without any issues.&nbsp; I can also connect up my headset
 to a different machine and it still works so I know the headset is functional.&nbsp; Since it worked previously on this laptop and the headset works on a different laptop(aka, both pieces of hardware are good), and everything is back to ground zero from a factory
 reset along with all latest drivers.&nbsp; What software issue is stopping me from using my headset?(since it gives zero error/warning messages)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it kind of makes sense directing me to the developer forum.&nbsp; If there's any actual MS engineers there so they can improve Windows so it can detect/correct whatever the fudge is going on.&nbsp; I just need an answer quickly.&nbsp; My window for returning this
 headset and notebook is fast approaching.</p>

<h2>            Wouldnt waste your time</h2>
                    
<p>XBOX is a thief, They charge me for a game/Service I never got, then when you call or write for help, they either have a different person email you everyday (the exact same way as if its your first time complaining),&nbsp; or they are just rude and unhelpful,
 I wont put up with it, so I cancel my Gold Subscription, and they charge me again the very next day for a month of xbox live (Even though it wasnt supposed to be renewed for 10 more days, So I call again and am told they put that charge through at the begining
 of the month, and my bank held it back that long. So of course I called my bank, and was told that was a complete lie, the charge was made a day after i canceled, So as a result, I charged back that fee, and the fee for the service i never got, as well as
 I will never again be a customer, XBOX has lost a loyal customer they had for over 4 years who payed $50 a month for misc services all because of dishonesty and theft.</p>

<p>Seriously ? Well this seems to be the same problem i run into with you guys, You see my account name listed on this post, why cant you simply pull it up and find out the answers to your questions ? Do you have any clue how many times i have had to explain
 this ? and too how many people ? And every time i go through this intense process of explaining myself again and again and again, it always the same result, &nbsp;it all falls on deaf ears, then they transfer me to yet another person, who starts the entire conversation
 over again, as if i had never filed the complaint. </p>
<p>RE: SRX1160315839ID - Xbox 360 Live:Xbox Live 360 other</p>
<p>this is my current complaint with you guys, I have had it answered by 3 different people, each person says the exact same thing.</p>

 you could please respond back with the DLC or game content that you were trying to download and get working that might get a response from either a support representative on the forums or even one of the regular folks around here like myself or RED SHIFT1.</p>

<p>Sure, I wasn't aware that gamers responded to these forums, this is my first time here, So i will temporarily shelf the rudeness, and explain.</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, I purchased Mafia II. This is a 6.5 gig download, I download the game, try to play it, and it either locked up my xbox when i pressed start, or it would goto the start story screen and lock up my xbox there.</p>
<p>This of course meant, I could not play the game, so I deleted it, and began the download again, after the second download completed, I rebooted my xbox (sometimes this helps) and tried again, same result, seeing as how 6.5 gigs takes me all night to download,
 we are now on day 3 of them having my money, and me having no game.</p>
<p>So Now I call the support line, I explain myself to the representative, she tells me, "Oh sir, we will get this fixed, we will not charge you for something you don't get." Which is of course the way it should be, she took down my contact information, and
 a Supervisor called me back, He told me to go through a number of Troubleshooting/Maintenance routines to see if the game would play, it of course would not, and he said well try the download again after we did all these steps.</p>
<p>So I did, I am or was a CPU Tech, so after the next download did not work (Download # 3) I redid my entire system, I moved all of my content off of my xbox, including all profiles, all updates, everything.</p>
<p>This of course forced me to recreate my profile after i rebooted, which is what i wanted, then i began the download again, in the morning, to be safe i rebooted the xbox, then tried to move the game to my USB drive, so that i could back it up, and the file
 would not move, would error out about 2 minutes into the move, and of course the game would not play. (Download #4)</p>
<p>I am a Disabled Vet with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, I need games to play to take my mind away from reality (Which is full of reasons to aggravate my condition), going through all this crap, had my dandruff up, I needed a mental break from it, So I purchased
 another game, From Dust, a 1.6 gig download, this game downloaded and played fine, So I once again began the download of Mafia II, then played the new game to get my mind off of all this craziness.</p>
<p>In the Morning, I go through my Normal steps, and try to copy and play the game, same result (Download #5)</p>
<p>I try once more, I tell myself this is it, the next morning I try once again to get the game to play, nothing, same result as before.(Download # 6)</p>
<p>At this time i call their support line back, I say look, I have tried everything i can to get this game to play, and seeing as how I purchased, downloaded and successfully played another game, I have a hard time believing that I need to clean my Xbox system
 all over again and that will fix it, Which is what i am told to do, I explain to her that I have been through all this, it falls on deaf ears, So i say to her, ya know, I need a game today, how about you guys just give me a credit for another download ?</p>
<p>Well I was rudely told no refunds, strange I think, she acted as if i should have responded with, Oh OK, sorry i will just go buy another game then, y'all keep that money.</p>
<p>I got off the phone, Logged onto xbox lives website, and canceled my recurring gold subscription, the very next day I see a charge from them in the amount of the monthly fee, I call them and am told that my bank made an error, that the charge was put through
 to the bank on the 4th of the month, &nbsp;and my bank took until the 16th to process it, So Like i said before, I called my bank and found out that was a lie, they researched the charge for me, it was put through the day after i canceled my account, even though
 the next month should not have been due until the following 4th.</p>
<p>And just FYI I tried to download Mafia II 4 more times, while waiting for my bank to fix the charges, for a total of 650 gigs downloaded from them of worthless and unusable product.</p>
<p>So I start submitting my complaint via their email system, &nbsp;they send me a email I respond, they do not respond to my email response, instead the very next day I get someone new introducing themselves, and the issue is never discussed, just a new guy each
 day, To me this shows the very low level of intelligence that xbox employees work with, I was a loyal member for 4 years, I bought at least 1 game every month, usually 2 or 3 if i could swing it, and payed for a gold membership, and they have lost that, simply
 because they wouldn't work with me, &nbsp;I am not unreasonable, I just simply wont take a we got your money, we could care less if you got our product attitude.</p>
<p>Today the bank refunded all of these charges i speak of, so now the financial part is taken care of, &nbsp;so now unfortunately because of my illness I have to complete the moral part of this issue, and let people know the treatment xbox gives loyal customers.</p>

<p>Hey dcosper - Your using the original XBOX 360 hard drive that came with your system correct? I've heard of this issue actually happening when the hard drive has some sort of weird glitch, it's usually solved by just simply getting a new hard drive or replaced
 if you're still under warranty. USB Flash Drives won't always work when it comes down to this. I don't know what the status of your warranty is currently but seeing as you've gone through a crap load of re-downloads I can assume you don't actually want to
 invest in even trying to get another official XBOX 360 hard drive for your system and trying it on there. You should actually be able to get a refund for this by just simply speaking to the supervisor and telling them that you've called multiple times and
 tried to download it with no avail, I know some folks have these sorts of issues and it's honestly unfortunate that it had to come to you canceling your Gold membership. I hope my advice reaches you with good spirits in giving XBOX Live another try.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, I download to my original hard drive, and the drive is fine, keep in mind that in the middle of all this madness, I downloaded "From Dust" another game that's a 1.6 gig download, and I have no problems playing that game, so logic
 would dictate that it isn't my drive, or the other game would not have played either, its the download, please also keep in mind that before i became disabled i was a CPU Tech for very large insurance companies for a long time, meaning i am not the average
 Joe consumer, I build custom CPU's program in a few languages, and know my stuff, I have done everything possible on my end short of buying a new system (Which i cant afford and its the download that is the problem so it wouldn't fix the problem anyhow), and
 you say, I should call a supervisor and they will work something out, all of these mean emails are because, I have done that more than once.</p>
<p>And I am told "No Refunds" period, there is no middle ground, they are not interested in reaching an agreement that would make both the customer and xbox happy, nope not at all, I am told rudely to contact my bank to dispute the charges as that will be the
 only way i get my money back.</p>
<p>So why should they ever get any of my money again ?</p>

<p>Hey mate, very sorry this thread has been missed--not sure why that happened, but we are here now. I've read through your post, and I'm afraid that refunds are not available for purchased content. That being said, I'd like to help get to the bottom of your
 issue and get that content working. My first question is, though you've downloaded an arcade game with no issues, have you downloaded a full 'disc' game like Mafia II to the HDD before? If so, what game? And when was it downloaded and played? Again, for sorry
 for the troubles, but we would like to do all we can to get that game working for you.</p>

<h2>            PC doesn&#39;t recognize Discs, CD&#39;s etc.</h2>
                    <p>System type 32-bit Operating system (Windows 7)</p>
<p>I want to reinstall my Windows, but my PC doesn't recognize the Windows disc. Not just that but disc in general. I want to switch to a 64-bit Operating system but my PC doesn't let me do that because it doesn't recognize disc's, cd's etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/314060</p>
<p>I tried everything except 1,4,5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put for example a CD in my PC, my PC doesn't register that I have put a CD in my PC. Kinda weird.. It doesn't say/show(nothing pops out) me that there is a CD in my PC when clearly I put CD in my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced,</p>

            <p>Is it just the Win7 install disk that it does not recognize, or no disks at all.&nbsp; Try some others like for example an audio CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not read any CD or DVDs, then it is likely a failure of the CD/DVD drive.</p>
<p>If it does read others but not you install disk, then there is something wrong with that disk. Try cleaning it carefully with eyeglass cleaner.</p>

            <p>I've tried other CD's such as old music CD's and still my PC doesn't recognize it.</p>
<p>I thought it was a problem with the CD such as with scratches or something, so I cleaned it.</p>
<p>Sadly, that was not the case with me. Any CD I put my PC still wound't recognize it.</p>
<p>I tried using the Win7 install disk on a laptop and it worked so I&nbsp;automatically knew it wasn't a problem with the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop computer (cpu involved).</p>
<p>I have it for about 4 years now.</p>
<p>I should probably stick with buying a new one, but I would like for this computer not go to waste so I want it to give it to my younger brother.</p>

            <p>If it were my computer, I would replace the CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; <span>
One of the most common failures is the DVD/CD drive.&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is simple to solve and low cost.&nbsp; About $20.&nbsp; Remove the power cord,&nbsp; Hold the power ON switch in for at least 7 seconds.&nbsp; Lay it down on its side with the wires on the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take
 the side off.&nbsp; You may have to remove the front panel as well.&nbsp; The DVD drive is held in place usually by 2 easily accessible screws.&nbsp; You have to remove 2 cables from the back.&nbsp; Pull the old one out.&nbsp; Slide the new one in its place.&nbsp; Attach the two wires,
 they only fit one way.&nbsp; Put the 2 screws in.&nbsp; Put the side and front back on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before you close it up again, if you have one of those cans of compressed air, blow out the dust, focusing on the fans and in particular that finned thing on top of the processor with a
 fan on it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is an easier alternative.&nbsp; It is a portable DVD drive that connects to the computer via a USB cable.&nbsp; Some get their power from that cable.&nbsp; Cost closer to $25, but you then have a
 portable device you can use on any computer.&nbsp; However, this has a drawback when it comes to re-installing the operating system.&nbsp; You will have to have a driver CD available at that time.</span></p>

            <p>Such a helpful tip! Thanks!</p>
<p>Are there any useful and/or&nbsp;efficient tweaks to other programs that could help the PC to register the CD's when I put them in the drive. The moment I&nbsp;realized the I had a problem with the driver I had a feeling that I should spend more time digging inside
 the PC to see if there were any problem with the drive itself. I clean my PC every month or two. I had a thunderstorm in my area not so long ago and it stuck my PC. I went to the nearest tech store and they fixed "everything" in the PC. Maybe they forgot about
 the driver because usually they check on your graphics card, motherboard etc. I will try my best at doing this great tip of yours. I would prefer if you had any tips like forcing the PC to check if there is anything inside the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were there any other people that had a similar situation like me? If so, what did they do to fix it.</p>
<p>Also, when I go to my Device Manager, "DVD/CD-ROM drives" is missing. When clearly I can see that there is a button on my PC which opens the driver.</p>

            <p>You should have told me this at the beginning. That confirms that the most likely cause is a failure of the drive.&nbsp; OR, it could be damage to the part of your main board that manages it.&nbsp; I would take it back to that same store.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that there is a software problem.</p>

            <p>True, sorry I haven't told you earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll probably just take it back to the store to check it one last time. I hope it works!</p>
<p>I just&nbsp;over exaggerated a little bit, so I just wanted to fix my driver ASAP. I should give way more information in the beginning, my bad.</p>

    <title>Cannot enable BitLocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n.cabrilo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot enable BitLocker</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need help with drive encryption. The BitLocker keeps giving me an error with a message "The startup options on this PC are configured incorrectly. Contact your system administrator for more information".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17241c7f-31bf-4c55-ae3b-e93e59cbd1a1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17241c7f-31bf-4c55-ae3b-e93e59cbd1a1?upload=true" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted everything I could on my own, and finally decided to ask a support here. Here is the chronological list of event that led to current state:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* On my ZBook 15 g3, that originally came with mechancal drive, I had BitLocker enabled and working for a while now</p>
<p>* Sometime ago I got a system notificaiton to update the security processor (TPM) driver. As this meant decrypting the drive, and encrypting it again, I opted to postpone this</p>
<p>* Finally I bought an SSD and decided this was the moment to update the TPM</p>
<p>* I have disabled the BitLocker, cloned the drive and replaced the HDD with new SSD (everything went smooth)</p>
<p>* Then I have update the BIOS and TPM drivers to the newest version (also smooth)</p>
<p>* Afterwards I have cleared TPM and rebooted the system</p>
<p>* Currently TPM status is - Attestation: Not Ready, Storage: Ready</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1fefcaf-365d-4cd4-a169-89af8bce6e97?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1fefcaf-365d-4cd4-a169-89af8bce6e97?upload=true" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last thing to be noted, as this is requirement from BitLocker, there are at least two partitions on the noted SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7de5e10-c0ec-4593-990b-430f9d4856f5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7de5e10-c0ec-4593-990b-430f9d4856f5?upload=true" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone has an advice on how to proceed on, thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Nenad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with your concern, you could check the Local Group Policy if the following is enabled:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>gpedit.msc</em></strong> and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the directory below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives</strong></em></p>
<p>3. Make sure that <em><strong>Enable use of BitLocker authentication requiring preboot keyboard input on slates</strong></em> is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I'd recommend posting your question in the <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprosecurity&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet forums</a></strong>,

<p>If you normally connect over wireless then the ethernet cable message is a bit of a red-herring. IOW you can ignore that message as it simply means Windows wants to use the unconnected ethernet card after it loses the wireless connection. Disable the ethernet
 connection to get rid of that message.</p>
<p>The real issue would be what is causing the wireless connection to drop and why isn't Windows able to reconnect it automatically.&nbsp; It's probably a software related problem. High on the list of possible causes are; the WiFi drivers,&nbsp;3rd party firewall&nbsp;or
 anti-malware&nbsp;which can intermitently block the wireless connection, and peer-to-peer downloading software which can overload your open&nbsp;connections causing either the WiFi adapter or router to crash.</p>

    <title>grey theme for win8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirk28  say:</h3>
<h2>            grey theme for win8&#63;</h2>
                    I need a grey colored theme for Win8 so I wouldn't see any pure white backgrounds or menu except on web pages where they intended to be white.<br />
I always used a kind of custom color scheme in Windows since win2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White backgrounds burn my eyes&nbsp; so I need something like&nbsp; Photoshop before sc6.<br />
Is there a source of such themes somewhere? All I can find are just useless fancy ones not suitable for a work environment.<br />
<br />
I tried High Contrast ones. They have a few color settings but several important for me programs (3d max for example) makes on-screen artifacts&nbsp; under those themes. &nbsp; So I need a "normal" grey theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
It looks like your DNS information may be incorrect.<br />
<br />
I suggest contacting your ISP to have them help with correcting the settings for that computer.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span></p>

                    <p>My fiance and I have been playing Sea of Thieves, he on his Xbox One Console, and myself on my Windows 10 Computer. Only problem is that I can only invite him to games because the Xbox App on my Windows doesn't give me notifications on game invites! Is there a fix for this? Its becoming exceedingly frustrating.</p>

            <p>Hi Tea Tongue Tess,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Incorrect configuration setting is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to sent a game invites to your friend from Xbox app. To resolve this concern, you need to make sure that your NAT Type is Open.

 <p>Hi Tea Tongue Tess,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Incorrect configuration setting is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to sent a game invites to your friend from Xbox app. To resolve this concern, you need to make sure that your NAT Type is Open.

 </blockquote> <p><br /></p><p>I've checked my NAT&nbsp;type and its Open. I've also checked my online security setting and they're all essentially set to FRIENDS, with game invites being set to EVERYBODY. I didn't change any of these settings, but I'm still not receiving game invites.<strong> It's an XBox One to XBox Windows 10 App issue.</strong></p>

 </p><p>Hi Tea Tongue Tess,</p><p><br /></p><p>Normally, you should receive notifications for game invites on your Windows 10 computer. It's possible that it got disabled on your computer. Let's try to check it this time by going to <em><strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions</strong></em> on your computer. From there, kindly check the toggle switch under "<em><strong>Get notifications from apps  and other senders</strong></em>" if it's switched on. If so, kindly turn it off, then turn it back on again to refresh its status.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you still didn't receive notifications for game invites, kindly launch your Xbox app and then click the gear icon to access the Settings page. From there, go to <strong>Notifications</strong> tab and check if "<em><strong>Party &amp; game invitations</strong></em>" option is marked as enabled. If so, kindly unmarked this option and then marked it again to refresh its status.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep us updated with the result. We'd be glad to fur

<h2>            Sea of thieves unfair ban</h2>

<div>
<div>Dear Microsoft Staff,<br />
<br />
My account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** has recently been unfairly banned from Sea of Thieves, as a result of an exploitative accusation of "Violating the Terms of Service". I am really curious about what exactly is behind this ban. I have never ever been involved
 in any such violation. I am a long time player and a very old and loyal customer and fan of you. I would never ever stoop as low as to break my word and violate the Terms of Service which I had agreed to.<br />
<br />
I am very dissatisfied with this reason of suspension and the charge I am being accused of, because I have never ever committed anything that could even remotely violate the terms. I am deeply offended because of this allegation because I would never perform
 nor be interested in such activities.<br />
<br />
I even dare you to ask anyone who knows me, so you can see they will confirm that I am a complete rule abiding video game player. I have no interest in such activities nor have ever been involved in committing any of them or anything at all that could hold
 my account liable for this ban. I am asking you to please review my computer and IP and make sure that my account or security have not been breached at the time of this unjust suspension. It is highly possible that without me being aware of it, my account
 could have been compromised and somebody committed this.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, I am imploring you to investigate my account so you can see that I am being honest and truthful in my statement. Please feel free to ask any kind of information you might require in order to complete your review and fix this issue.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>ich bekomme keine Verbindung der Smartglass App hin, weder bei mir zuhause noch bei meiner Familie. Ich habs mit dem Lumia 1020 und dem Windows 8 PC versucht, sowie kurzfristig den Strom kurz rauszunehmen. Ich bin definitiv mit beiden auf dem gleichen Netzwerk.
 Irgendwelche Tipps?</p>

<p>Wie CrazyLizard oben schon gefragt hat: Habt ihr 100% geprüft, dass ihr die korrekte Smartglass App für Eure Konsole geladen habt? Es gibt eben die Smartglass App für die 360 und eine andere Smartglass App für die One. Beide sind NICHT untereinander kompatibel
 oder austauschbar! Die One Smartglass App funktioniert nur mit der One, und die 360 Smartglass App nur mit der 360.</p>

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer</h2>
                    Hey, Sorry about tacking this on but for some reason asking a new question just results in an unspecified error and I need help with this. How can I stop the windows easy transfer? How can I reverse the current progress? The computers have been transfering
 for nearly&nbsp;36 hours and still say&nbsp;5 hours left to go with only 57gig of data.&nbsp; I don't want all the data, and couldn't figure out how to specify what to download.&nbsp; Would it be easier to just delete everything I don't want once it finishes the transfer?

            The wizard itself is responsible for extracting your backup files to their respective locations, so there is no pick and choose.<br />
<br />
If you want to end the wizard, right click the Taskbar &gt; click Start Task Manager
<br />
Under Applications, right click Windows Easy Transfer in the Task list<br />
Click Go to Process<br />
Right click the Windows Easy Transfer process when selected and click End Process<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are doing the transfer over a Network connection? Have you tried installing the Windows Easy Transfer wizard on the old computer? Try creating a Windows Easy Transfer .mig file, save to an external hard disk or save it locally and copy it
 over the Network to the New Computer then run the Easy Transfer wizard and open it and see if it will move faster?

    <title>Microsoft shoving apps down the user&#39;s throat in new Creator&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> collectivetoothbrush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft shoving apps down the user&#39;s throat in new Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>I've just performed a clean install of the new Creator's Update (build 15036.13). This is not an Insider's Preview build, as it was downloaded using the new version of the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tend to remove all UWP apps using powershell whenever I re-install Windows, including ones that cannot be uninstalled using the settings/control panel UI. This is because I don't use these apps, I never intend to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't believe that removing these apps would somehow "break my windows". This has always worked absolutely fine in previous builds - in Anniversary Update this still worked fine. There's no way that removing the new "Photos" app or "Groove Music" would
 somehow ruin the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, ever since I installed build 15036.13, it seems that Microsoft has made it much harder to get rid of these apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the command I run in powershell to remove the apps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Usually this is enough in previous builds. However, with the new build, I would have to re-run this command multiple times. The apps keep reappearing, either as a complete installation, or as a pending download. This happens even when Store has been removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to stop this by disabling telemetry related services, blocking telemetry related IPs using the host file. Rebooted my computer, the apps are finally gone for good, but this happened to my start menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0de7e36c-aaa1-442c-960b-c2b407835045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0de7e36c-aaa1-442c-960b-c2b407835045" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm not wrong, the blank tiles are the evidence of Windows trying to force install the already deleted apps. I have to restart the "Shell Experience Host" process to make the start menu work again. And I have to do this every single time the computer
 restarts, with the blank tiles automatically re-pinning themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Either I've done something wrong, or this is how Windows work. If it's the latter, then it's absolutely disrespectful to the users. So how do I prevent the start menu from automatically resetting it's layout to what's in the screenshot every time the computer
 restarts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I fixed the functionality of my start menu - I no longer have to restart "Shell Experience Host" process. However, the layout reset that occur every time i restart my computer still happens. Here's another screenshot that shows that Windows force install
 these apps (fail to do so of course):</p>

            <p>That's not the point. Problem is, removing them has always been fine. Why is it causing a problem now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, it's more understandable (though still ridiculous) if, say, removing the "Mail" app causes problems, because Microsoft didn't allow it to be uninstalled through the GUI. But we're talking apps like Twitter and Candy Crush Saga - which automatically
 re-installs itself after being removed. This is malware level of intrusion.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Illegal Audio Recording During Party Chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcclane914  say:</h3>
<h2>            Illegal Audio Recording During Party Chat</h2>
                    
<p>I was recently recorded in a party chat during an XBL session. I wasn't told I was being recorded during the conversation, which I believe to be illegal.</p>
<p>The recording came to my attention because a friend on XBL told me that someone had sent them a message through XBL, stating &nbsp;that I had been recorded, &amp; that the recording was placed on a website.</p>
<p>Another one of my freinds on XBL was also advised about the recording, &amp; they were&nbsp; told the website address on which they posted the recording without my consent or knowledge.</p>
<p>The gamertag(s) involved apparently with the recording is <strong>[REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS]</strong></p>
<p>Both of their gamertags are on said website, which I will not post for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Who can&nbsp;assist me regarding this matter? All help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks In Advance.</p>

<p>Recording the party without informing you certainly isn't illegal. If it was, I would definitely be in jail by now, as I record every game I play, with voice chat, just incase something hilarious happens. I even upload some random conversations and trashtalking
 I find hilarious to my youtube. I'm certainly not secretive with the fact I record people. I'll even send them a message saying 'Say hi to YouTube? ;)' after stuff calms down.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted before saying I don't understand why someone would be worried about recording unless they were running their mouth and are now afraid of the consequences..? There's absolutely no reason to be scared or threatened by anyone recording as long as you're
 abiding the ToU/ToS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, the most you can do is request they take the video down. Next time, just don't talk if you're afraid of being recorded... No matter how harsh that sounds, literally ~50% of the people on LIVE have some type of recording device (HDPVR, Dazzle,
 easycap, toaster)...</p>

<p>Actually, let me answer that it IS illegal UNLESS you are telling everyone that you are recording them and get their verbal or written consent via XBL messages, email or the like.</p>
<p>If you are recording their voices without their knowledge then, yes it is illegal. It is a form of "wiretapping."</p>
<p>You have to make sure that everyone gives their consent verbally or written, and the problem is every time someone joins the party, you have to continue to inform them that you're recording and get their consent. &nbsp;You can't miss even one person.</p>
<p>And, besides, it's just the better way to treat people all around, so it's not about you doing something wrong or having a "running mouth." &nbsp;It's called mutual respect.</p>

<p>Googling about it appears the law is different depending on which state you're in. Some states require all party consent while others don't require consent. There's not a blanket federal law that says whether or not you can do this.

<p>@Broken Alyce</p>
<p>I absolutely disagree. If it was illegal, the selling of recording devices such as HDPVRs and Dazzles would be outlawed just as wiretapping tools are. I don't bother getting consent from anyone in the game, I just record and upload when something interesting
 happens. No FBI knocking my door down, no bans from Xbox LIVE, no YouTube suspending my account for illegal/malicious activity = no change in the way I do things. You can look on youtube - the tons of prank videos on Xbox LIVE - take Good Grief for example
 - Do you think they're all 'OH HEY WE'RE RECORDING THIS, IT'S ALL A JOKE, GIVE ME CONSENT TO RECORD SO I DONT GET THROWN INTO JAIL'? No. The element of surprise is what makes recording stuff entertaining and shows the true colours of people.</p>
<p>This will be my last post on this matter because I certainly don't want to insult you OR the original poster.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You can contact MS in regards to this via the second link above. My opinion on the matter would be since you are playing on a public domain, the Game Developers servers via XBL, it would be at their discretion of wether it was
 allowed or not. You would have to check IW/Sledgehammer?Activisions Privacy Policy to be sure if it allowed or not. Currently there is nothing mentioned about this in the MS PP, unless I missed it. One way to be sure would be to talk to legal counsel, they
 would know the current laws regarding video/voice recording while on public domains.</span></p>

<p>"Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced." &nbsp;- &nbsp;Albert Einstein</p>
<p>When people like the TV shows PUNK'D occur, written consent is received after the prank is done. &nbsp;You still have to get their permission to air it through a media release form. &nbsp;I know this, because it's part of my job is to cover media legalities via internet
 and public domains such as television because my company operates in that domain quite often. &nbsp;So, no, the prank nor the joke isn't required to have the legal permission. &nbsp;It's the publication of said action.</p>
<p>Federal law doesn't state that there is any cut and dry way of whether this is truly illegal or not, and goes via laws per state. &nbsp;What federal law does state is that they encourage everyone to tell people that they're being recorded so that way everyone
 is on the same page, and again, it's just respectful to those around you. &nbsp;It's always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>This will end up being the sole discretion of XBL, I'm sure. &nbsp;Because each individual is operating out of different states. &nbsp;There are even specific legalities in the act of recording the voices alone, then certain legalities if that conversation is then
 published without consent of one of the parties. &nbsp;Again, each state varies in those laws.</p>
<p>As far as those programs being made, the program itself isn't illegal. &nbsp;It's how the program is used. &nbsp;Again, it's about the publication, not the program itself. &nbsp;I can easily compare this to other products that are sold, but it's the intent behind the use
 of that product which causes the legalities to occur. &nbsp;Glass pipes are sold in tobacco stores, and they have to put up signs stating that they're not to be used for illegal purposes, but they're still sold. &nbsp;Cameras are still sold, but if you're using it to
 take photos of someone and then publish it without their permission, then that's where the action comes in. &nbsp;It's all about the action and intent behind the product, but these products can't be held liable if you choose to break the law with it. &nbsp;So of course
 they make those programs, but that doesn't mean recording others without their permission is legal.</p>
<p>As for XBL, the people that have spoken directly to them via phone, XBL is on the side of McClane that this isn't proper and XBL doesn't support this behavior. &nbsp;But, then again, they may be stating that for the purpose of keeping their clients happy and
 telling them what they want to hear. &nbsp;Who knows? &nbsp;But I guess we're going to find out soon enough.</p>
<p>I mean no disrespect in any manor towards anyone, I'm simply stating my opinion.&nbsp; McClane, I wish you nothing but the best outcome for this situation.&nbsp; I'm sorry that you've been bothered by these other individuals, but this will appear to be a learning
 situation for us all!&nbsp; Please keep us informed, I'm interested in the outcome.</p>

<p>Hey there McClane! I'm sorry to hear about your issue. As far as options I can offer you, we do have tools on the dashboard to report these users for harassment and let you block communication with them in the future. You can check out our Guide (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../19139.aspx</a>)
 for more information.<br />
<br />
That said, if you feel that a law was broken, you can contact your local law enforcement for more information on what can be done regarding this issue. If they do open a case, they can contact Microsoft directly for assistance with their investigation. Please
 note that this must be by the investigating officer only and cannot be done via the forums.<br />
<br />
Again, I am terribly sorry for your experience and am available if you have any further questions or concerns. Thanks!</p>

<p>Broken Alyce writes:</p>
<p><em>“Actually, let me answer that it IS illegal UNLESS you are telling everyone that you are recording them and get their verbal or written consent via XBL messages, email or the like…”</em></p>
<p>Then a few moments later she&nbsp;contradicts&nbsp;herself by saying:</p>
<p><em>“Federal law doesn’t state that there is any cut and dry way of whether this is truly illegal or not…”</em></p>
<p>So which is it Alyce?</p>
<p>Lets clear it all up for everyone shall we?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live&nbsp;Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;clearly states:</p>
<p><em>“<strong>You should not expect any level of privacy concerning your use of the live communication features</strong> (for example, voice chat, video and communications in live-hosted gameplay sessions) offered through the Xbox LIVE/Games for Windows Live
 Service. We may monitor these communications to the extent permitted by law. However, we cannot monitor the entire Service and make no attempt to do so.
<strong>You understand that others can record and use these communications. Communications in live-hosted gameplay sessions may also be broadcast to others.”</strong></em></p>
<p>However Xbox Live is a private service and because of that they can use the ban hammer to vanish you from Xbox Live for whatever reason they choose. It’s their service they can refuse it to anyone for any reason. So I suppose you could be banned (for recording
 XBL) based on this but it is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>So now that we understand that Microsoft doesn’t care if you record <a href="http://shitmyxboxsays.com/bacon-no-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bitchy</a>, <a href="http://shitmyxboxsays.com/mcclane914-dont-play-no-games-yo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
whining</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://shitmyxboxsays.com/barbie-rant-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">newbz</a> as you *** talk them. Lets move on to what the law says.</p>
<p>Microsoft is obligated to comply with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CALEA</a> which is a law that passed in 1994 that in part allows law enforcement to capture both audio and video communications
 via XBL. In fact they provide <a href="http://consoleforensics.com/xbox-forensics-presentation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
detailed instructions on how to do this</a>. The CALEA law is what allows law enforcement to freely record XBL for investigative purposes.</p>
<p>But what about if you aren’t a&nbsp;member&nbsp;of law enforcement? Are you legally allowed to record your XBL gameplay and audio sessions? Well, I'm no lawyer and even the ones I've talked with cant say conclusively either way. The law says in a public setting you
 are subject to being recorded and you have no legal recourse as long as you are in public. While an XBL game session may seem like a “public” game, it’s actually a private game. The game is happening over XBL which is a private service. Therefore it’s up to
 Microsoft wether to allow the recording of XBL sessions on it’s private service. As we kindly pointed out earlier, Microsofts XBL Terms of Service do in fact do allow others to<strong>&nbsp;”…record and use these communications. Communications in live-hosted gameplay
 sessions may also be broadcast to others.</strong>”</p>
<p>So, to sum it all up… McClain &amp; Alyce! We look forward to the next time we meet on XBL… :)</p>

<p>Cl0wn, you son of a *** you beat me to it. But there are a few thing's I feel also need to be pointed out.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to show the difference between a <span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FACT</span></strong></span> and <strong>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">FACT</span></strong> from one of the replies is from Cl0wns post:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong><em>"The Xbox Live Terms of Service clearly states:</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong><em>'You should not expect any level of privacy concerning your use of the live communication features (for example, voice chat, video and communications in live-hosted gameplay sessions) offered through the Xbox LIVE/Games

 live-hosted gameplay sessions may also be broadcast to others.'"</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Another <span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FACT</span></strong></span> would be that the average temperature of a healthy human being is 98.6 Degrees F.</p>
<p>But an <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">OPINION</span></span></strong> from the posts here would be such.</p>
<p>McClane914: <strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><em>"I was recently recorded in a party chat during an XBL session. I wasn't told I was being recorded during the conversation, which I believe to be illegal."</em></span></strong></p>
<p>Broken Alyce: <strong><em><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">"I mean no disrespect in any manor towards anyone, I'm simply stating my opinion."</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Nothing either of you has brought to the table is a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">FACT</span></span></strong>, but just something that you believe. I believe that I am good looking
 enough to land a super model, but that's just not going to happen.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Broken Alyce's credibility for just a quick second. In her second reply, she states:</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">"I know this, because it's part of my job is to cover media legalities via internet and public domains such as television because my company operates in that domain quite often."</span></strong></em></p>
<p>But, Alyce, I have audio of you stating that you are a Psychologist. Now, what would a Shrink be doing battling the legalities of media used in public domain? Hmmm... that's a toughy. But the fact of the matter is this:</p>
<p>Your either a Psychologist, a paralegal, or neither. Personally, I lean toward the latter. But that is my
<p>Now lets dig a little deeper into Alyce's little rabbit hole:</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">"And, besides, it's just the better way to treat people all around, so it's not about you doing something wrong or having a 'running mouth.' &nbsp;It's called mutual respect."</span></strong></em></p>
<p>We have never gotten any respect from you, neither have any of the people we play with. If a person even has us added, you don't gice them the respect to allow them to play in your lobby so long as we don't join
<strong>AND</strong> stay, you just kick, kick, kick. And why do you do that? Because you can't currently beat us, so you assume and spread the fear that we are modding. Why don't you report us for tampering? Is it because you know that XBL will find no evidence
 of it? It's an unhealthy cognitive bias called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>The fact of the matter is that you are just concerned that it will make others agree with what we know: That you are just jealous and paranoid. So you throw a big stink and hope we stop. The
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">FACT</span></span></strong> is that this post means we won. We did what we set out to do. Clown on you, get some laughs, spread your ignorance, and **** you
 off.</p>
<p>So, watch out, because you never know who will be recording you. Rhxme is right, the amount of people that record everything they do on their Xbox is growing. It's becoming easier and more affordable. See you in the Motel ;)</p>

<h2>            Why Is Skype getting progressively worse&#63;  Why Does Skype Lagg, Why are  File Transfers slow, Why can you leave skype alone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using for work for over 15 years and it used to be absolutely fantastic I would add a contact than we could in real time&nbsp; Chat, Call, Video and do file transfer, my files and chats would be saved so I could review them at a later date, If I was
 gone somone could send me a file and it would be downloaded when I came back it was fantastic and an indispensable tool for inter office communication as well as corresponding&nbsp; with overseas clients and customers all who were on different time zones from 2
 hours to 12 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am absolutely baffled of how you can take a simple good product and turn it to slow bloated program that can no longer do even the simplest tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really liked the old skype because:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually sent messages in real time&nbsp; &nbsp;a feat the new Skype&nbsp; can take up to 1-2 minutes to accomplish even if its just&nbsp; a message containing Text&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Images sent would be transferred in the resolution and format, the new skype I send a diagram and its too low res for other person to read if the file is under 5MB why the heck are you making it smaller ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>File transfers to&nbsp; auto start it should auto start from contacts I have designated as trusted ones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you running this product what is wrong with you ?</p>

<p>You're not alone. I have huge issues with Skype 8.x (desktop version) as well. I keep getting logged out at random times. Some days it doesn't happen, other days it happens several times. It also tends to forget my login/password and
<em>all </em>my settings when it happens, so I have to redo them <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
every time</span>. It's like torture. I never had any issues like this with Skype 7 on the very same machine, on the same internet connection. Even on my laptop too, when I'm visiting other people. I've tried uninstalling, removing settings directories, reinstalling,
 everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's absolutely repulsive that we're forced to use this new version, it's like a downgrade. I also miss a lot of the old features, and old Skype generally felt snappier and less bloated, and it just worked all the time (for me at least). The only reason
 I'm using this turd that is Skype 8, is because it's the only way I can keep in touch with some of my friends. :-(</p>

<h2>            Unable to access wireless keyboard and mouse on login screen</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my computer this morning, the first screen with the date and time come on and I can't do anything. There is no communication between neither my wireless keyboard and the screen, nor between the wireless mouse and the screen. I've tried all the
 keys, tried to reboot as nothing. I called Microsoft support and they want $149 before they try to fix this. Is that what I have to do? I think this problem is scheduled in to happen and then they want money to fix it. Has this happened to anyone else???</p>

                    Hi guys! First I installed a program called Folder Locker. And now I'm having a trouble deleting flk file that occupies around 2 GB. What I did was I shredded the file without opening the folder locker program and yet it still there in my Document.
<b>Another thing is that folder locker won't even accept the password anymore</b>.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This what appears everytime I would attempt to delete it :&nbsp;<b>An unexpected error is keeping you from deleting this file. If you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem.&nbsp;Error 0x801F0004: Disallow
 the Fast IO path for this operation</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I tried shredding it again and again and uninstalled the program and even did the &nbsp;system restore but with no luck. Pls help. :( Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. Im using win7 netbook.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is a troubleshooter for that type of issue which includes the solution you found<br />
using File Assassin in case others have the same issue.<br />
<br />
Use Safe Mode if possible - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.<br />
<br />
If needed use these utilities <br />
<br />
UnLocker 1.91 + (Free)<br />
<span><a href="http://unlocker.emptyloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://unlocker.emptyloop.com/</a><br />
</span><br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on -&nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
The below also work on 64 bit Vista<br />
<br />
Another good alternative - Use FileAssassin :<br />
<br />
FileAssassin - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Force Delete (Cannot Delete) Locked or In Used Files or Folders with FileASSASSIN<br />
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on -&nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
And this - MoveOnBoot<br />
<br />
MoveOnBoot<br />
<a href="http://www.softwarepatch.com/software/moveonboot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softwarepatch.com/software/moveonboot.html</span></a><br />

<h2>            Incorrect mouse pointer icons</h2>
                    
<p>My mouse cursor shows the wrong icon as I move it&nbsp;around the screen.&nbsp; for example, it may show the hour glass as I hover it over a button.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;it will show the double sided arrow as I hover it over the title bar of a window.</p>
<p>this is a fairly new install of windows. only about a month old so I do not have much software installed.</p>

            <p>I have tried this and it did not correct the problem -- mouse pointers continue to be mixed up.&nbsp; Also, after waking from Standby, mouse pointers are white blocks with random pixels.</p>

            <p>Hello Steven N_485,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Often we see&nbsp;odd behavior&nbsp;as the result of a program loading during the startup process.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve these, we use clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>The following articles describes this process:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that after we narrow down the cause, it is important that we go back to a normal startup and remove the program from startup manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>
