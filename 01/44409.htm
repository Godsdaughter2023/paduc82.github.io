            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would help if you could answer these questions in order to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the mouse and the computer?</p>
<p>- Is it a wired or a wireless mouse?</p>
<p>- Does the cursor freeze when you try to move the mouse?</p>
<p>- Have you tried unplugging and re-plugging the mouse to check if the issue persists? If not, please do it once.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Have you tried unplugging the external speakers from the computer? (If you are using a desktop)?</p>
<p>-&nbsp; What exactly do you mean by "My computer hesitate"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do let us know the following so that we can help you.</p>

<p>I have the "moving mouse" sounds that the original writer described. &nbsp;The sound is a three or four note "bubble" like &nbsp;tone sequence that works in combo with the mouse movement. &nbsp;To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Laptop: &nbsp;Lenovo ThinkPad &nbsp; Windows 10</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mouse: &nbsp;Gigaware</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Wired Mouse</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Cursor often freezes when trying to move the mouse. &nbsp;But the "bubble-sounds" are active, even though the cursor is stuck in place.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The issues persists after plugging and re-plugging the mouse.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;There are no external speakers. &nbsp;Sound comes from the laptop speakers.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;"Computer hesitate" &nbsp;For me, this is no more than the cursor being stuck in place. &nbsp;After a few seconds, the cursor movement typically restores itself. &nbsp;But the "bubble sounds" persist, especially when the mouse is lifted from the mouse pad.</p>

<h2>            Computer halts on boot until key is pressed</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a friend's machine that has Windows 7 installed. During the boot process, after the dots come together on the boot screen, it will just stop loading. All disk activity ceases and it will just sit there until any key is pressed. The drive
 then starts again and everything boots normally. This has been happening for a few weeks my friend told me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling all 3rd party services and startup items, yet the issue continues. The boot log isn't helping because it doesn't have a timestamp on each entry (like it used to, do you hear this Microsoft!!!!!). With no time entries it is impossible
 to know which service was the last one loaded before I hit a key to resume booting. Is there another log option or troubleshooting method to track down what is causing this 'hang'?</p>

I did and the result is the same. I decided to try a system file checker and it flagged a couple of files it could not repair. Will do a check disk and then try a system repair.

    <title>Does the Treasure Glitch affect 100&#37; Completion&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffmomm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does the Treasure Glitch affect 100&#37; Completion&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, in my Tracking Hobbits level, I ran into a glitch where the count of Treasures found went to 4/3.&nbsp; After the level, when it was counting my studs, etc., it updated this to 0/3 even though I have found them all and they are in my inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Has anyone else run into this and did it impact the 100% completion at the end?</p>
<p>2. If I redo the level, would it count it up correctly and set it back to 3/3?&nbsp; I've been afraid to replay it thinking that maybe it has a "3" stored behind the scenes somewhere and if I do it again it will reset to "0".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I am saving the replay for the end, so if I complete everything else and 100% doesn't pop, then I'll reply the level and let everyone know what happened.)</p>

<p>Just a follow-up to my post in case it helps others. &nbsp;I can confirm that this glitch DOES impact the 100% at the end. &nbsp;:-(</p>
<p>I am missing 1 mithril brick and it is from the Tracking Hobbits level where it says I have 0/3 treasures, even though I have confirmed they are in my Treasure Trove.</p>
<p>What I have tried so far:</p>
<p>1. Replayed the level on Free Play digging up all 3 spots where the treasure was. &nbsp;In each case, it gave me a blue stud instead of the treasure, so the game knows I have them. &nbsp;I played until I got the 3rd treasure, and then saved and exited.</p>
<p>My next attempts:</p>
<p>1. Play the whole level on Story mode to see if I can reset the counter.</p>
<p>2. Play the whole level on Free Play, all the way to the end to see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>I am not hopeful that either will work, so I seem to be stuck. &nbsp;I am disappointed, b/c 4 achievements are stuck due to this 1 glitch.</p>
<p>If anyone else has run across some similar and knows a work-around, PLEASE let me know. &nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>Here's a quick update from TT Support. &nbsp;(I like how I keep responding to my own post. &nbsp;It's like talking to yourself electronically. &nbsp;lol)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the summary of an email chain between me and Sam from TT Support. &nbsp;(Email address and full names removed to protect privacy.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Is this right area to submit bugs with Lego: LotR? I am at 99.2% and my last mithril brick in the whole game is bugged. If this is the right place, please let me know and I can give more details. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Sorry to hear about the trouble you've been having. We're currently investigating the issue, with the hope of releasing a patch in the near future (unfortunately i cannot provide a date at this time). Once the patch is approved, we
 will announce a live date. (360 and PS3 only).</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. &nbsp;Will this patch fix existing saves, or will I need to start a new game?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: The patch will fix existing saves, as you load into Middle-earth, the achievements should unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Great news - thanks Sam. &nbsp;I will keep an eye out for news of a patch being released.</p>

<p>Just so you know they had a glitch on lego star wars 3,very similar to how this sounds,and they kept promising to fix that one too.</p>
<p>There are many people still at 930/1000 years later.</p>

<p>lego games are the worst for glitch`s and screen freezes of any games i have played.</p>

<p>I'm experiencing something like that, though I'm not sure if it's in the same level (I can't remember off the top of my head). I've read a lot about Lego game glitches, like THEOWENKILLER said. If this is the same glitch, it will be the first one to prevent
 me from getting an achievement (I've been lucky). Harry Potter Part 1 had a nasty glitch about not being able to reenter a certain area that had a bunch of collectibles. I did experience that, but I luckily got all of those collectibles but one. And the last
 one I was (again, luckily) able to enter a code for. I think TT did at least give codes for all of those collectibles (they couldn't fix the glitch is what I gathered) but I could be wrong. I know Harry Potter Part 2 was definitely patched at least once. I
 can't imagine them not patching this game. But keep in mind it's been out only about a month. Not sure how soon most games come out with their first patch (it probably just varies), but I would think about this time would be about average. And they did at
 least confirm they are working on it. But cross our fingers the situation THEOWENKILLER brought up won't happen again.</p>
<p>I will say that Lego LotR has frozen up more than any other Lego game I've played. It's been A LOT. Actually, more than any other game I've ever played. Especially in 2 player.</p>

<p>Just checked. I'm having the same issue but on the Weathertop level. I definitely saw that 4/3 thing also, but I can't remember which level. But if it's related to the fetch quest items, then it must have been Weathertop. I have at least one of the fetch
 quest items for this level (the purple hat) and have given it to the sheman-dwarf. It popped up again in the level as I was playing it tonight, but couldn't pick it up again. Even though I was able to pick up all the treasure kits for the level again despite
 having 10/10 kits for that. *shrugs* I guess I'll open a support ticket with TT also. Sometimes more glitch reports (ie demand) gets things rolling faster.</p>

<p>I sent TT another email yesterday looking for an update. &nbsp;Here is the response I got. &nbsp;Looks promising...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Do you have an update on a potential patch for this? &nbsp;Or I heard in some other games, TT was able to give out codes to unlock certain items. &nbsp;Is that an option?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong> The patch has been submitted, so now it’s a waiting game. Hopefully this month \ early January.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks for the update, Sam. &nbsp;This is encouraging news!</p>

<p>Received an unsolicited email from Sam this morning. &nbsp;Sounds like the patch is HERE!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong> We’ve recently released a patch for the 360 and PS3 (Europe), which addresses a number of issues. The patch corrects current save games, which means you do not need to start again. &nbsp;The patch will be
<span>available on the PS3 in</span> North America, at the moment we do not have a release date from SONY.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> That is great news, Sam!&nbsp; Does this mean the Xbox patch is available now?&nbsp; Or do you have a date when that will come out?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> The Xbox patch is available now. Please follow your console manual on how to install patches, I’m not allowed to tell people how to do it....</span></p>

<p>I tried last night and was disappointed when the patch did not download. &nbsp;:-( &nbsp;I just tried it now and the 4MB patch downloaded. &nbsp;As soon as I loaded the game, the cheevo popped for having all the mithril bricks. &nbsp;I fast traveled to Bree and made my last
 Mithril item and the 3 remaining cheevos popped. &nbsp;Everything works great!</p>

<h2>            All Folders &#47; Files Stuck in Read-Only State after weDownload Manager Virus</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>As the title says, every file/folder on my computer is blocked into read-only mode.</p>
<p>I cannot remove this attribute in any way.</p>
<p>I have tried the following methods of changing it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore point to before it happened.</p>
<p>Right click, properties, uncheck "read-only" (it unchecks, but if you re-open properties it's back)</p>
<p>I've tried ALL of the attrib commands as adminitrator&nbsp;for changing this including all with system as well. They have no effect.</p>
<p>Basically every method I can find listed on any web site.</p>
<p>None have worked.</p>
<p>I did manage to fix Windows update so it works correctly again and for the most part the system "works" fine.</p>
<p>As far as system related stuff it doesn't matter, but for example, if I update a game it tells me it can't write to necessary files (because they're read only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information that's not already plastered all over these forums would be greatly appreciated. I assure you I looked for the last over 18 hours. I have never posted in this forum before because I've never found a problem I couldn't solve before... this
 one has me mind boggled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters it's a fresh re-install of windows, the license is over 90 days old. I'm not willing to pay more than I did for the operating system for support
</p>
<p>(It would be cheaper to just buy another copy of Windows 8 and use the free support)</p>
<p>I am also not entirely convinced they would be able to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a solution that does NOT require me re-doing my last 4 days of work and downloading. So refresh, restart, or further system restore is out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need an advanced method of fixing this like for example undoing whatever system file was changed to make it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did this all happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so When I was trying to resolve a problem with my audio driver I apparently installed a virus on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program creating the issue is weDownload Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I understand a great deal when it comes to this, I am very tech savvy and do not make mistakes like this often.</p>
<p>(Normally I repair peoples computers from stuff like this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've helped others in similar issues with XP, Vista and 7 before but find myself stuck with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty confident I've removed all of the software causing the problem as well as it's rogue counterparts to reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between Malware-Bytes, CCleaner, Glary Utilities, Revo Uninstaller, and many manual methods of tracking it I can no longer find any startup processes that would seem suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Information that may be helpful:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 (Updated from Windows 8.0 Professional).</p>
<p>Not a lot of programs installed except Microsoft Office 2010 (Home &amp; Student)</p>
<p>Steam w/ several games (All Safe)</p>
<p>Google Chrome, Skype, Aion, TeamViewer 9</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I installed this Operating system maybe 4 days ago. The entire 4 days was spent downloading and installing software.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of installing this software yesterday.</p>
<p>I even did a system restore to the earliest point yesterday I could.</p>
<p>Only other restore point would erase all I've installed/updated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As strange as it may seem, and really makes no sense, if you right click on any file or folder and select Properties, it will say "Read Only" at the bottom of the window. Even the Win 7 Pro machine that I'm on right now is that way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is normal, and should not prevent you from using the file or folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error you are encountering most likely has it's source in the "SECURITY" tab of Properties...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where you need to alter the Permissions...</p>
<p>Your programs must not be falling under one of the "Group or User Names", or if it is, it needs it's permissions modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to click on the EDIT or ADVANCED to modify them.</p>
<p>You may need to add the game as a USER... It would be easier to just add "EVERYONE" to the list and allow full permission...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is basically how a folder and etc. becomes "Shared", by windows adding a "Everyone" to the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see any user name that appears to be connected to your weDownload Manager, try deleting it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Already tried that several times over in every way I thought would make any difference. I even went as far as to make a new user, make it the admin, then make that user the new owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no users in any of the groups that could be the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went as far as to re-enable the computer management console in MMC and combed through every user on there. I in turn did a search on any one I did not immediately recognize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that I also removed any permissions that were granted to anyone but myself on my new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with that under the new user account as the sole owner with sole rights I was unable to change this status. Once again I could uncheck it, but upon re-examining the properties "read-only" was re-checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assure you this problem has me utterly perplexed and I've been a computer technician&nbsp;for some 20 years now. It is rare I encounter a problem I cannot fix and as such I suppose this is a problem I am unlikely to find anyone to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A part of me is so determined to solve this issue because it is one that if I encounter in the field I don't want to look incompetent when I don't know how to fix it.</p>

            <p>If it gives a clue to how far I have gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed every non-essential user. I've even removed Trusted Installer (which I know is a legit MS one) from every permission group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even back-door logged in as "System" via command prompt and filtered through the users as well as attempted to change the attrib properties as system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing I know related to users or attributes using command prompt logged in as system can fix this I am not even sure it can be fixed. Which is something I hate to admit defeat to because that means some malicious attacker has won...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am not certain how you could be uncertain what it is I am trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll make this as simple as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every, and I repeat "Every" file on my computer is marked as read only.</p>
<p>Yes, I can access it, I can open it, it doesn't have a horrible effect most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there are MANY programs that respect the read only attribute and will not write over or to a file marked as read only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is simple, remove that attribute (not really all that complicated of a concept).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has nothing to do with permissions however I assure you it is NOT a permission based issue. I have managed and controlled every user to the point of obsession and I would not miss something as obvious as railing to check the include folders and
 subfolders (which is actually checked by default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to alter a folder you do not have permission to alter you actually get an access violation error. This however gives no error, it actually acts in every way like it completes successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's simply when you re-check the file under properties it's back to read-only as if it had never really left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with it comes the annoying things such as when I save a word document it tells me the file is marked as read only, yadda yadda yadda...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The read only aspect has everything to do with the file attributes and on a properly working system checking or unchecking that box is what adds or removes that attribute without having to enter a command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing users and permissions controls is who has rights to add or remove such things from a file. There are no users with such rights, not even the original owner of the files that was logged in when the malware was installed just in case somehow
 that profile was corrupted.</p>

<p>What I am telling you is that the read only attribute in the Properties window IS NOT the problem...</p>
<p>All of my machines are that way, and I get absolutely no "Read Only" errors....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in the Security Tab, you will in fact see that there are settings for Read, Write, Modify, etc...</p>
<p>A file can be accessible by Permissions and not generate an access denied error... because access is permitted...</p>
<p>Modification and writing will be blocked, but not access...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you messing with CMD, that seems like overkill, and may be part of the problem...</p>
<p>This can all be done by clicking a button under the Security Tab...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried taking ownership of the entire drive ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a Microsoft Account, it is more restricted than a Local Account, but I think that is what you are saying you tried...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't be of more help here... I've never had a "Read Only Box" error, even though the setting is checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try some more suggestions if you would like, but it seems to me that you are beating your head against the wall for the wrong reason...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Read Only box being checked is an issue, why do I have 60Gbs of programs that run perfectly with it checked ? Most all of them write files of some type to Program Files, Program Data, User Folder, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible issue is that Win 8\8.1 don't tolerate creating new folders in the root of the C:\ drive very well... that is something different from Win 7.</p>

            <p>What I am telling you is that the read only attribute IS the problem.</p>
<p>I am not concerned with access, I can access every file on my computer just fine.</p>
<p>It is specifically writing and modifying the file that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is every file on your computer including documents, pictures, folders you create and everything else&nbsp;marked as read only?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to assume the answer to that is no, if you can answer to yourself "why not?" then you are probably over thinking what I am trying to do or the problem I am having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If every file on your computer is marked as "read only" and you actually believe it's supposed to be that way and makes no difference, you probably should not be answering questions trying to help people as you're likely to influence people to make really
 bad choices with their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not post to ask philosophical opinions on the usability of a computer that is in such a state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have used every operating system exclusively until 7 and only recently began using Windows 8.1 as frequently as I now do (for the purposes of familiarizing to support people) recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am simply looking for an alternative to override that attribute or what system controls could possibly change file attributes like that. This should not be a difficult question for a technician familiar with Windows 8.1 which is what I came here hoping
 to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if that in any way sounds rude, but it's a fairly direct question and not something I came here to debate reasoning on why I would want to fix it. If my cigarette lighter in my car was broken and I took it to the shop to fix it, I would not expect
 anyone at the shop to ask me if I smoke or debate why&nbsp;I would need it fixed if I don't.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are misunderstanding each other here....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; I am not concerned with access, I can access every file on my computer just fine.</p>
<p>It is specifically writing and modifying the file that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Writing and Modifying the file are specifically two of the options in the Permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Is every file on your computer including documents, pictures, folders you create and everything else&nbsp;marked as read only?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes... The only exception I can find are shortcuts.</p>
<p>I did a little more checking, and actually the folder containing the file is marked "Read Only"</p>
<p>The file inside is not....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about it... The other option is "HIDDEN"... This concerns the actual folder, not the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; This should not be a difficult question for a technician familiar with Windows 8.1 which is what I came here hoping to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a Microsoft Technician, nor are most of the other responders... Most all are volunteers trying to help other users...</p>
<p>The "Technicians" are called Support Engineers, and it is clearly marked as part of their user name...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; &nbsp;If my cigarette lighter in my car was broken and I took it to the shop to fix it, I would not expect anyone at the shop to ask me if I smoke or debate why&nbsp;I would need it fixed if I don't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only a dishonest technician would charge you to fix a lighter that wasn't broken... just not being used properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp; You specifically mention a Word Document giving a "Read Only" message...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had similar messages with Word Perfect, and the error had nothing to do with Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I remember correctly it happens when you have the same document open twice at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It hasn't happened lately, so I don't remember the exact circumstance....</p>
<p>
</p><p>6)&nbsp; Another person had a similar problem with a game... I suggested he modify the Permissions for the folder\file, and maybe add "EVERYONE" as a USER... It must have worked...there has been no other posts concerning the problem continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7)&nbsp; From what I can tell, you haven't even tried what I suggested concerning permissions or you would already have noticed that the READ, WRITE, MODIFY, READ and EXECUTE are part of the Permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8)&nbsp; You might try posting your issue on the TechNet Forum... There is a bit more expertise concerning such subjects.</p>

                    I intend to upgrade to Windows 10 at the end of July. I've been running 64-bit Windows 8.1 with no problems except one - whenever I try and apply Update KB3000850 it fails. I've tried multiple times after taking all sorts of advice from the internet but
 Update KB3000850 just won't install. So my question is this : will the Windows 10 upgrade still work even if KB3000850 hasn't been installed beforehand? Thanks.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Bluetooth connectivity issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Bluetooth connectivity issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>While developing a Bluetooth HID device, we've encountered some connectivity issues between different keyboards and the Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>We had 2 keyboards that flat out cannot connect to the Surface: Apple's A1644 and Logitech's K850.</p>
<p>Our own device can connect, but after turning it on and off the Surface doesn't reconnect automatically.</p>
<p>We tried updating/reinstalling drivers, disabled Bluetooth Radio sleep settings, but to no avail.</p>
<p>The only options are unpairing and pairing again, or opening the "Connect" menu from the Notifications panel (which possibly triggers a Bluetooth device scan).</p>
<p>There seem to be plenty of Bluetooth issues with the Surface, so help would be appreciated if anyone is familiar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            My opinion is that the Bluetooth issues are more related to Windows 10 than to the Surface. (Although I will say that if you are using a WiFi 2.4GHz network as opposed to a 5GHz WiFi network there is a lot of opportunity for interference as it shares the channels with Bluetooth). You can certainly try the Bluetooth trouble shooter <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a> as well as the Surface Diagnostics Toolkit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> 
<br />
<br />The Bluetooth issues seem to have increased with the Fall Creators Update as that's when the reports/complaints started appearing. Use your favorite search engine and look for "bluetooth issues fall creators update" and you will see what I mean. 
<br />
<br />That said, for development issues, you might also want to post in the MSDN forums. 
<br />
<br />I don't know if the upcoming Spring Creators Update (1803) addresses some of the issues. If you have a test machine, you might want to try the current Slow Ring build just as a point of reference.
<br />
<br />Best I can offer and I hope it helps. Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.

<h2>            Activation, Product Keys and chinese tablets.</h2>
                    Why am I forced to pay $120 for a product key when my only mistake was upgrading android on a dual boot chinese tablet that did come with any product keys listed in the packaging??? &nbsp;This is so silly...the tablet only cost $200 in the first place and other
 tablets are like$60 and have genuine activated windows....but you mess up the bios held key and all bets are off and you must pay MS $120 because you didn't buy hardware from a manufacturer with english support?? &nbsp;Why can't the activation servers require official
 brand name, model, and serial that associates with each key so that MS can activate all these devices that don't ship with key documents?? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is just such a crock!! &nbsp;It's great they are doing Windows 10 upgrades free, but they need better support for activation issues on devices that are getting sold outside their home language markets.

<div>"Administrator Password</div>
<div>&nbsp;This option lets you create a password to prevent others from changing the UEFI</div>
<div>settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Organizations that need to protect sensitive information typically use an</div>
<div>administrator password. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you enter the administrator password incorrectly three times, you’ll be</div>
<div>locked out of the UEFI. Restart your Surface to enter the password again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Important</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you set a password for the UEFI, record it in a safe place. If you forget the</div>
<div>password, you won’t be able to access the UEFI settings. You can only reset the</div>
<div>administrator password from within the UEFI. "</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>there isn't anything we can do to recovery the UEFI password.</div>

<div>You will need to contact Microsoft Support to discuss an exchange. Sorry.</div>

<h2>            Power DVD 19 no longer displays &#40;blank purple screen&#41; after last win 10 update</h2>
                    Reinstalled and got a small square where key goes and pasted it and could see some of the numbers on the square, but that is all that happened. Before I reinstalled got a message the current install was incompatible. Have contacted Cyberlink, but wondered
 if anyone else had this problem as it does not show up anywhere else I could find?

            Hi BLOO,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />You can login to the following Microsoft website to do this: <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices</a>
<br />
<br />Once here, select 'More actions' underneath the device you want to remove access to, and select 'Remove Laptop/PC'.
<br />
<br />You could also change your Microsoft password, which will then prompt the device to enter the newly reset password in order to access the Xbox App under your account.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<p>I can use software on my desktop but when I try to use Microsoft 8 Apps than none of them can connect to internet . 3rd day of use Windows 8 and nothing is working .</p>
<p>I'm really disapointed - fresh installation and don't work .</p>
<p>B1- N101&nbsp; this is an error code showed when I tried to use Netflix app . Rest of apps don't show error code at all - just screen with no information &nbsp;another disappointment .
</p>
<p>Users have no chances to find solution at all . </p>
<p>My laptop is connected and I can use Internet but can't use internet when I'm at windows 8&nbsp;app mode . strange - are these settings separate ?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for coming up with a Windows 8 concern.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing issues with Windows apps then it is worth trying to run the app troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>L</span></strong><span>et’s run the Modern UI app troubleshooter and check if you’re able to access the app store. The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution
 and incorrect security or account settings.</span></p>
<p><span>You may download and run the troubleshooter from the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><span>Create a new local account and check if the issue persists. Refer to these steps to create a local account:
</span></p>
<p><span>a)</span><span> </span><span>Press <b>‘Windows + W’</b> key to search Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>b)</span><span> </span><span>Type <b>“Users”</b> without quotes and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c)</span><span> </span><span>To create new user account click on the plus sign (+)
<b>‘Add a User’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d)</span><span> </span><span>Select <b>‘Don’t want this user to sign in with Microsoft account?’</b></span></p>
<p><span>e)</span><span> </span><span>Click on <b>‘Local account’</b> button.</span></p>
<p><span>f)</span><span> </span><span>Enter the User name and click on <b>‘Next’</b> button and click on
<b>‘Finish’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g)</span><span> </span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the answer , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I have tried first option and message appeared - security issues , second time I have run this troubleshooter&nbsp; base system device driver has not been installed . Third time display device driver is out of date .
</p>
<p>I have installed windows 8 as an upgrade to Windows 7 home premium&nbsp;64 bit .</p>
<p>I use brand new DELL XPS L702 laptop with latest drivers updated .</p>
<p>Once I have bought windows 8 and installed it was working correctly . Next day it wasn't working at all - and it is not working till now . Hope it will work one day .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 .</p>
<p>I have tried to create user however it is impossible to create one if there is no internet connection .
</p>
<p>I mean in my case there is internet connection - I can use IE Firefox Skype etc. but from the desktop not in app mode .</p>
<p>So another issue is - we can't add new user when windows shows internet connection problem . It is obviously not real situation .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be possible to help me to solve that issue ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't expect that happen straight away - fresh installation and cant use apps can't use windows 8 at all.</p>
<p>Good thing is that I can use desktop applications which are working without issues .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have finally created desktop user .&nbsp; <br />
I have gone trought your advices .<br />
<br />
Still I'm unable to use any application in app mode - no internet connection .<br />
<br />
Still cannot use Windows 8 as I have been able to use for a 1 day . <br />
<br />
Is it any chance to restore to windows 7 or I would need&nbsp; to install it again ? <br />
<br />
I'm really tired of this and there is no support in place to help sort out problems .<br />
<br />
I will ask paypal for refund as Windows 8 is faulty . <br />
<br />
I have paid for something which dont work <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            I uninstalled Windows 8 and went back to Windows 7 because I was running into too many issues like this.&nbsp; I could not get my work done.&nbsp; However, I did see a post somewhere a long time ago suggesting that a connected VPN is causing this problem.&nbsp; If you
 have a live VPN connection, try disabling it, and then see if the problem is fixed.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do if indeed this is the cause.&nbsp; But, at least you'll know where to focus your efforts.<br />

</span>I do use a VPN for my work PC and saw other posts about that so I disconnected the VPN, shut down that PC &amp; rebooted the router as well as my Win 8 PC – no dice.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

I see several threads on this issue in your forums – most say the same thing:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Download &amp; run our troubleshooter – check your INet/LAN config - - have done both (as well as the above) several times, no dice.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have faithfully supported MS from Win 98 SE and on – even in light on the barrage of marketing re: “Mac is Better”<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;cast to device&#34; problems with Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>So I have been using windows 10's "Cast to device" feature to watch movies from my computer on my TV via my Xbox one.</p>
<p>The problem is it only works about %30 of the time. One day when I right click and "cast to device" my Xbox will come up straight away and everything will be fine, but the next day it simply will not appear and I will get the message "No devices found".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no idea whats going on! I've tried restarting both my Xbox and PC, I have triple checked that ALL the sharing settings are open and my computer detects my Xbox in device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why some days it will work and other days it will just refuse to detect.</p>
<p>Please send help</p>

This is the only thing that worked for me when my XB1 stopped showing up in connected devices and in "Cast to." I did the hardware troubleshooter, then it said a problem was fixed and I needed to reboot my PC. After I did that the XB1 started showing under
 Cast To again. Thanks!

            <p>Master sigue estas instrucciones, me sirvieron para poder hacer 
funcionar la xbox app que descargas de la microsost store, si esa no 
esta funcionando no te va a logear el juego, si no quiere logear esa app
 sigue este procedimiento.</p>
<p>Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>a: </strong>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b: </strong>Then click <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Now type the following command and hit enter</p>
<p><strong>Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a restart (signing out and back in didn't work for me) I entered the following command (again in a powershell in admin):</p>
<p><strong>Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</strong></p>
<p>This will install any missing built-in apps you may have uninstalled.</p>

    <title>Asus GPU Tweak II - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> traceman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus GPU Tweak II</h2>
                    <p>I bought an Asus R9 390 8GB DDR5 8GB VRAM GAMING version card. Their is Tweaking software available with it. And, on the Asus Website their are newer and stable versions now. I have used this on Windows 10 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro. Both Exact same configuration.
 I found once I update the driver for the GPU that the Asus GPU Tweak II no longer works. It will not uninstall correctly. It will not reinstall via over writing. It wont work if I remove all AMD software and start over. I have several days in this. No luck
 with Sys Res. Refresh, Reset or any of it. Registry cleaners to remove any left overs do not work. And due to the error messages I receive when I try to reinstall I can most certainly tell it has some trash left in the registry. Do you guys have anything on
 the Microsoft side for this for a change. I came here as a last resort. I would love a solution to be able to update my video&nbsp; drivers without ruining my R9 390 control software. If I keep at it, I will no longer have the ability to do anything with my CPU
 as far as a small overclock (which I did remove while attempting to repair this) Yes, I turned off Norton protection as well. Thanks ahead of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Tracy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get the software recovered after performing 'Reset' as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the additional software (that is not a part of OEM or factory settings) recovered even after resetting the system to factory settings, then there is not much scope to troubleshoot the issue. One thing that you could try before contacting ASUS
 support is&nbsp;a Microsoft Fixit that helps uninstall applications even from registry entries. Refer to the following link to install and run the fixit.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/program_install_and_uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix problems that programs cannot be installed or uninstalled</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists even after using the above mentioned fixit, then you might have to contact
<a href="https://www.asus.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ASUS support</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Apps that are out of focus appear blurry</h2>
                    <p>Apps that are not in focus appear blurry, text and images after about 3 seconds of not using them but become clear as soon as you click the app or move the mouse near the app causes it to go back into focus, This only started happening yesterday, My drivers
 are up to date and it is not related to clear font which i have messed with thoroughly to make sure it wasn't a problem.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This is a known issue for old applications that doesn't support the new DPI scaling changes on Windows 10. You can define these applications as a DPI-unaware process by following the steps below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the application that you are having issues with scaling.</li><li>Right-click the application in the task bar.</li><li>Right-click the name of the application and then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>,&nbsp;check the <strong>Override high DPI scaling behavior
</strong>option.</li><li>Under <strong>Scaling performed by </strong>drop-down menu, select <strong>System (Enhanced)</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> Ok</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Afer performing these steps, Windows 10 will handle the scaling behaviour and will fix issues with the interface and text being blurry for that application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

I'm having this same issue. I have a 4k laptop connected to a 1080p monitor. The scaling on the laptop is 150%, and the monitor scaling is 100%. All apps work fine, except for Microsoft Office. I've updated my drivers, and it is still blurry on the laptop,
 but fine on the monitor. I went to the application properties, but there's no compatibility tab. I know how to fix the dpi problem for most applications, (I had to change the compatibility settings for Fusion 360 and it works fine), but there's no compatibility
 tab for Microsoft Office. Can you tell me how to fix it? If there isn't a fix, hopefully there will be in Office 2019.

            The fix i found was actually unrelated to DPI scaling as i suspected, it was related to settings within Nvidia control panel that needed to be changed to fix my problem. I don't remember what settings they where since it was 2 months ago

<h2>            Windows 10 installs games without permission</h2>
                    <p>After clean install my internet was really slow. I opened Youtube to listen something and I noticed interruptions. So I went to the Store and saw a list with apps waiting to be installed - CandyCrush, Minecraft, Twitter etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my opinion Microsooft gets some money for these apps.... <strong>But why nobody ask me If I actually want them?! I think I/WE have enough brain to install them IF they're useful.</strong></p>

<p>Those programs are bundled with Win10. You can remove them and a lot of the other bloatware MS forces on us by using the commands</p>
<p>in the article below. These commands do not uninstall the games/apps. <br />

<p>We are stuck with a lot of stuff we may not need, but this new dictatorial forced updates MS business model has been well advertised,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of that stuff is part of Windows 10's installation...</p>
<p>The Icons are most likely on the Start menu to begin with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT... They almost immediately start downloading updates that can be 1GB in total size... Another issue is that if you "Uninstall" them, they will again download from the Store...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has supposedly been corrected in upcoming builds, but probably not available to the public until next year to the best of my understanding...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can do NOW though, is to go to the Store and click on the 3 dots on the upper right corner... Then Settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a switch to&nbsp;turn off "Update Apps Automatically"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 16 Apps waiting to be updated, but I need to start the process manually..</p>

            &gt; We need more information about your issue on Windows installing apps without permission, kindly respond to the following questions:
<p>
</p><p>ROFL... if you claim to work for Microsoft and don't know that your company is installing bloatware games without permission then I feel bad for you son.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reinstalled Windows on my Dad's computer, and we are now over his bandwidth limit - due in part to the amount of stupid games you downloaded to his computer. He is nearly 70, why on earth would you install Candy crush on his computer lol.</p>

<p>I've just added a fresh install of windows 10, not added anything but a local account and I have 7 or so game apps being installed (Candycrush, Minecraft etc)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the apps are not linked to the account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this Option 3 of "turning off automatic updates" is not so easy when I've removed "Windows Store" from the machine. How can these apps keep reinstalling themselves even though Windows Store is removed?</p>

<p>Go into the Store and turn off automatic updates helps.</p>
<p>After each major update by Microsoft there's always the chance of new apps being added. You'll just have to continue to remove the ones you don't want.</p>

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

                    I have been working with a single (administrator) user account in my pc until recently that I had to create a separate account for occasions I have to lend the device to third parties. the thing is, in order to optimize the limited resources of my computer
 I had done a great amount of personal configurations, from removing several kinds of eye candy to disabling start up applications and uninstalling the default windows apps (such as xbox, the default image viewer and all those games no one likes), even disabling
 some services I know for sure won't need.<br />
<br />
as you might expect doing this all over again would be tiresome, so I have to wonder if there is anyway to copy all or most of this changes I had made into the new user account. windows doesn't allow me to just copy the user profile (not that I would like this
 since I don't want nor can afford the disk space for my files to also be copied)&nbsp;<br />
cloning the account (except by the files) would also be an options. If someone could give some suggestions in this matter it would be much apreciated<br />
<br />
thanks for looking into this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern. Cloning in Windows is supported if you are going to clone the Windows itself, unfortunately, as of now there is no such option to clone or copy the settings of your old user account to a new one. In this case, what you
 can do is to create a new user account and gradually set it up to the settings that you want.
