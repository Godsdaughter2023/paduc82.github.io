<h2>            Windows 10 and printers</h2>
                    Just installed windows 10. &nbsp;Now my Epson RX620 printer won't work. &nbsp;It seemed to install OK, but won't print the test page and gives the 'printer error'. &nbsp;No other information seems to be available on what the error is and how to put it right. &nbsp;Any help
 out there please. &nbsp;I will feel very cheated if this free upgrade means I now have to buy a new printer. &nbsp;Thank You

            Hi PeterBusnack ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />You can delete your call history by going in the 'Chats' tab on Skype and then right-clicking and selecting 'Delete Conversation' or 'Hide Conversation' of the person you called with. This will also delete the call history from the 'Calls tab'. This does however delete/hide all of your conversations with that individual.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what down arrow you are refering to, feel free to let me know what I'm not remembering.

            <p>Hi Mauro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the Bluetooth driver currently installed on the laptop is not the latest one or isn’t compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the Model of the Dell Inspiron laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to a new operating system, when there are issues with the hardware devices (such as a Bluetooth/ network or a sound card), it’s better to check for updates offered from Windows Update. This will provide latest driver updates related to the
 device and peripherals connected to the computer. Let’s check for updates and see if it fixes our issue: Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Do I need to check for updates?” </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed further with the troubleshooting methods mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to try install the older version of driver for Bluetooth card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>X</strong> keys together and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Bluetooth Radios</strong> driver and expand the driver icon. Right click on the driver icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Update driver software</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Browse my computer for a driver software</strong>.</li><li>Select “<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>”.</li><li>Select the driver according to your device model and installed.</li><li>If this does not work, follow the steps from ‘<strong>a’</strong> to ‘<strong>c’</strong> and select “<strong>Search automatically for the updated driver</strong>”.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Download and install the latest Bluetooth driver for Windows 8.1 from Dell’s website and check if it resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to the link to know how to update drivers on Windows 8.1:</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I emptied it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 seconds later I had more trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I opened the Recycle Bin and watched as Windows 10 deleted 100% of my OneDrive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily i had made backups of all files. I'm not stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did Windows 10 delete all my OneDrive files???</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem but not to that magnitude.&nbsp; I have about 4500 music files and since upgrading to Windows 10, about 20 music files are deleted every day.&nbsp; I have recovered them each day from the OneDrive recycle bin but the next day they are deleted
 again.&nbsp; Every day it is mostly the same files with a slight variation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On August 6, 16 songs by Fleetwood Mac and Fleet Foxes were deleted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On August 7, 18 songs by Fleetwood Mac and Fleet Foxes were deleted plus one by Bee Gees and one Pink Floyd.</p>
<p>On August 8, 18 songs by Fleetwood Mac and Fleet Foxes were deleted.&nbsp; The Bee Gees and Pick Floyd were not deleted on&nbsp;August 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched through these files in detail and I seen nothing different from the properties of other songs.&nbsp; The songs deleted come from four different albums and there are many songs from the same albums that do not get deleted.&nbsp; The properties of deleted
 versus non deleted songs look exactly the same except for the name of the song.&nbsp; There are no special characters in the names or anything else that looks suspicious.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Windows 10 be deleting these songs?&nbsp; This did not happen on Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It just started after the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>

            <p>To me it almost seems as if I make any changes to a file while onedrive is trying to upload/sync it, the change throws it off so it just deletes it... add to that it does batch uploading/syncing it's deleting multiple files at a time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I start editing metadata, if I save a file and start editing another it starts deleting everything in that folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major flaw... </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Still doesn't explain why my Onedrive library has 3400 songs but Groove only shows 2560 lol</p>

            <p>Yes I think there is some connection to changing metadata that causes this. I've noticed many of the files deleted were files for which i maintained metadata but some also were deleted when metadata was not changed. Plus I've maintained a lot of metadata
 but only a small group of those music files were deleted. One thing I have noticed is that if i restore the files from the OneDrive on line recycle bin, the files were again deleted the next day over and over again. But once i restored the files from my PC
 recycle bin, onedrive stopped deleting those songs and instead deleted others. So each day I've had 20 - 40 songs deleted. I have cleaned up most of my files so I am going to stop maintaining metadata for a while to see if that is what is causing this. Thanks
 for the tip.</p>

</p><p>Regarding Groove music, that app makes no sense at all and i have quite using it and have gone back to Windows Media Player. Ive tried to make sense of number of files on pc, versus streaming, available off line, etc and none of those files make sense. Plus
 no mater what i do i can not get some artwork to update and many songs show download errors. Plus if i add songs to a play list the song gets an error and won't play. It's a terrible app in it's current state.</p>

            I made no metadata changes in the past 48 hours and have had no files deleted.&nbsp; I did change the name of my computer and when OneDrive synched up again it created 8 duplicate songs that had the old computer name but did not deleted any songs.&nbsp; Computer
 name is part of the metadata on a file and somehow the name was wrong and OneDrive could not figure it out so it created a duplicate.&nbsp; The good news is I did get an alert to that affect so in this case it worked.&nbsp; In summary I think you are correct that this
 delete problem has something to do with changing metadata and that is why only music files were deleted for me.&nbsp; I did not change metadata on any other file types.

            <p>So it looks like this is definitely&nbsp;related to metadata for music files.&nbsp; I had not maintained any data for 48 hours and no files were deleted.&nbsp; Yesterday I used and MP3 editor to change the album art on four songs.&nbsp; Today all four songs were in the recycle
 bin.&nbsp; There are still a couple items I want to test.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have noticed this problem only on Music files.&nbsp; However, I don't usually edit metadata on other document types so i am not sure if this is a problem for all documents.&nbsp; I just edited metadata on an excel and a word document so will check back tomorrow
 if these were also deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the above music files from the desktop recycle bin.&nbsp; When I have restored them from the desktop, I believe they stay restored.&nbsp; However, I believe in the past when I restored files from the OneDrive on line recycle bin the files were deleted again
 the next day.&nbsp; However I am not absolutely certain of this and will need to test it further.</p>

            So yesterday I maintained metadata on four music files and two excel files.&nbsp; One of the four music files was deleted and in the recycle bin today and neither of the excel files were deleted.&nbsp; This is not conclusive evidence but it does appear the delete
 problem is related to music files only when metadata is maintained either through WMP or by maintaining properties of the file in Windows File Explorer.

            <p>The problem seems to be related to just certain metadata.&nbsp; I maintained Year and Genre on 85 songs and all were deleted.&nbsp; I maintained name and album artist of a few others and they did not get deleted.&nbsp; So I am not sure what other fields trigger a delete
 by OneDrive.&nbsp; I do know it does not matter how I do the edits.&nbsp; Some songs that were deleted, metadata edits were made in Windows Media Player and others were made directly to the file properties&nbsp;in File Explorer by right clicking on the file and selecting
 properties/details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen no input from anyone at Microsoft on this feed.&nbsp; I hope they are aware and working on the problem.&nbsp; This is a major issue and should receive immediate attention.</p>

            <p>I am glad I read this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a desktop and laptop.&nbsp; Both Windows 10.&nbsp; Both logged in with same Microsoft userid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, copied a bunch of files from desktop to onedrive.&nbsp; They synched on Desk and Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, copied a bunch of files from laptop to onedrive.&nbsp; They synched on Desk and Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, (post synch) I moved some folders around on onedrive from my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, the next day I went to the laptop.&nbsp; The new directories were gone.&nbsp; Old directories were put back but everything was empty.&nbsp; No files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, I found every file in the desktop recycle bin deleted but in the old file structure.&nbsp; I panicked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sixth, I restored all from the recycle bin but files missing everywhere and in the wrong places.&nbsp; Egads!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seventh....this is important...., I went to the c:\users\matt directory on my laptop....There were 2!!! folders named OneDrive....How is this even possible?!&nbsp; Not OneDrive and OneDrive (2)....literally...2 folders named OneDrive....Well, in the first one,
 the data in the current onedrive form existed...however, in the second....was the folder structure and files I had changed the prior day.&nbsp; Saved!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I went back to living off my C drive because I don't trust OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to A) explain&nbsp; and B) fix....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, we are counting on these products working securely and consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please, please...speak up in this thread.</p>
<p>

<p>I get 0X80070003 running an MSU package from&nbsp;a network drive. If I copy it to the local drive it runs fine. I have seen many references to this but they all just&nbsp;say to run it from the local drive. I can run EXEs or MSIs from the network. Isn't there some
 kind of fix that will allow running MSUs from the network?</p>

    <title>Blue Screen of Death if Lock Screen is active too Long - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raidslayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen of Death if Lock Screen is active too Long</h2>
                    <p>Just how the title says, if the Lock Screen&nbsp;is active too long I get a Blue Screen of Death when I try to type a password to log in, this happens on all scenarios, when I turn my computer on and I don't log in fast, or when I walk away from my computer and
 it Locks itself, if I unlock my screen in less than 2 minutes nothing happens, but any longer and this will happen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've disabled my lock screen, my computer never locks the screen a gain and this has "solved" the issue, the only time that this has happened again is when I turn my computer on and walk away for 5-10 min, when I come back the Blue Screen of Death with an
 error comes up and my computer is restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I remember correctly on all occasions my monitor was off, I turn it on, I see the lock screen,&nbsp;I click the mouse or tap a key on my keyboard and the error happens. But like I said even if my monitor is off if the lock screen is not active for too long
 this does NOT happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My monitor is connected via HDMI, ATI Drivers, my drivers are up to date, I once got a BSOD when I unplugged the HDMI cable to plug in another HDMI cable to a different monitor. This has not happen again and I've switched screens the same way many times
 before and after that.</p>

I'm currently using DisplayCAL Profile Loader and it seems to work well. But is there a way that I can do without this app? It seems to be a problem that should be easily handled by the OS. Thanks for the help

<h2>            Skype updated, now it won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>So I did an update for Skype today (18/1/19)&nbsp; to 8.37.0.98 on Windows 10 and now I keep getting the message "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022). Click OK to close the application."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing some digging I've found that the node.dll file is denying access, but even after allowing full control on everything I can, the application still won't start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either a solution or a link to a previous version would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Magic92,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />I'd sugges that you uninstall the current version of Skype. If you currently have the Skype for Windows 10 App, then please download the Desktop Version here:-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the drop-down arrow and Select 'Get Skype for Windows' instead of 'Get Skype for Windows 10'.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if you had the Desktop Version, please now try the Skype for Windows 10 App, which can either be found in the Microsoft Store or in the above link by selecting 'Get Skype for Windows 10'.
<br />
<br />I hope this will help.

<h3> bluelion135  say:</h3>
<h2>            Banned from sending messages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to send a message to a friend one day and got the red&nbsp;"Because of your&nbsp;past behavior, you can't send messages" text that blocked me from sending the&nbsp;message. I didn't think much of it, because I never message people on xbox anyway seeing as I have other ways of communicating with friends&nbsp;and I've had this problem for months now. Now I'm curious though&nbsp;as to why this might be the case, because the xbox enforcement page says that I have a perfect record and I think the last time I messaged anyone was in 2015. Even then, I think i might have sent a total of 5 messages at most in the past two years, so I'm wondering if this is an error on xbox's part? or if there was an event that happened in the past that I just simply forgot about. Either way I would like to know why I'm getting this message if xbox is telling me I have a perfect record and no evidence of a history of misconduct and I would like for it to be resolved.</p>

    <title>Dual Boot Linux Manjaro Issues in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel foreman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Boot Linux Manjaro Issues in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am relatively inexperienced with computers but would like to try to learn linux (distribution: Manjaro). &nbsp;I recently installed Windows 10 and want to be able to dual boot linux. &nbsp;Following instructions online, it says that I have to shrink the C drive
 (which I did) and use and create an extended partition to install the linux operating system and necessary partitions. &nbsp;However, my computer seems to be unable to create extended partitions at all. &nbsp;I have tried to do this in both the Windows partition manager
 and inside Gparted running on Linux (from a flash drive) but Gparted only allows a primary partition to be made from the unallocated space and Windows's simple volume creation is not creating an extended partition there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my drive looks like right now:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f66414e1-a895-4cc7-a783-d3f4d8cbc5cd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating a simple volume:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6091bc28-251f-4c40-9b2b-834e5160f994" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The particular instructions can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=616wvkZuco4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>at 4:06</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else ever had this problem because I haven't seen any questions on this topic at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And does anyone know a solution. &nbsp;Any solution (including ones involving wiping the computer, installing linux, and then installing Windows) would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I am just wondering if it is really necessary to have an extended partition at all ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean you can also install it on a primary partition (or any other kind of partition). In fact, I got my Manjaro installed on a primary partition (together dual boot with Win 7 on a different primary partition though).

            <p>Well, I'm not too sure. &nbsp;I was only worried that I would be leaving irreversible damage
<span>
on</span> my computer so I tried following the instructional video to the letter, seeing as I know practically nothing about computer partitioning. &nbsp;All videos similar to it all use the extended
<span>
partition but</span> if you got it to work with just a primary partition, perhaps it would be able to work for me as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly did you install it on primary partition(s)? &nbsp;Would you be able to walk me through it, or describe how you did it? &nbsp;It would be very helpful and much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if the issue is just for my computer or me being an idiot. &nbsp;<span>For</span> me, Gparted says it can only create a primary partition and no extended or logical
 partitions. &nbsp;I thought that using an extended partition could perhaps allow for the creation of logical partitions, which seem to be in every instructional video, but I can't
<span>
know ever because</span> I can't create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might try to install regularly on another computer to see if this is just an issue with my
<span>
computer but</span> I want to make sure that it's an issue with this computer before investing the time.</p>

            <p>Sry for my late reply. Did not read emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for me, I recently upgraded my Win 7 to Win 10 (clean install). I still have Windows 10 and Manjaro running dual-boot.</p>
<p>What exactly does Gparted say if you try to make a new partition ? If it says, that it can only make a primary partition, why not try that (unless if you have BIOS instead of UEFI and GPT tables since BIOS only allows 4 primary partitions in total)?<br />

            <p>My system is UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run Gparted, the only option not grayed out is <span>
primary partition</span>. &nbsp;I can create the primary partition, but it just doesn't allow me to create logical partitions inside it, which are needed for the install. &nbsp;I tried it with a primary
<span>
partition but</span> the install failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could there be something wrong with my hard-drive, or is it a software issue running on my computer? &nbsp;The partitioning worked perfectly fine on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's something that just this one computer has, as I have other computer issues with it that I can't find anywhere else involving the software/hardware.<br />

            <p>AFAIK you cannot create extended partitions if you use GPT partition table (common on EFI systems). GPT only allows primary partitions (up to 128 I think). Thus, you cannot create logical partitions either, because they can be only created within extended
 partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution with extended partitions is for systems like BIOS who cannot have more than 4 primary partitions and therefore needed that workaround since Windows is commonly taking 2-4 primary partitions for itself (one for recovery, one for MBR, one for
 the OS itself and one for user data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that does not matter to Linux though. Linux can run on any partition while Windows needs to be on a primary partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of error did you get when you tried to install it on a primary partition ?</p>

            <p>How can I find out if my computer uses GPT or not? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would you install Manjaro on a primary partition? &nbsp;Just make primary partitions of the necessary parts of the installation (ext4, swap,
<span>
etc</span>)&nbsp;and install using the wizard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots of what I get while using Gparted and the wizard if they help.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca8a76c6-f49a-46c6-b567-2d95b9a8b88d" /></p>
<p>This is what I get when I try to run the <span>
gparted</span>&nbsp;to create the extended partition (if it were needed)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c7b3500-0998-4a56-bfac-225468bfde58" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my <span>
disk</span> now. &nbsp;I plan on using the unallocated&nbsp;space to act as the install location for Manjaro</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/012667d4-8920-4622-9968-5a83a6e4c0c8" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1807ba6-88b8-4231-ac8c-7aa635dadb93" /></p>
<p>Here too, primary cannot be unselected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you walk me through how exactly you installed it on primary partitions because I'm not too familiar with partitioning and don't want to permanently&nbsp;destroy something crucial. &nbsp;Guides online seem to all use the extended partition.</p>

            <p>As mentioned before, it does not matter to Linux whether its installed on an extended or on a primary partition. It only matters for Windows (if you were to install Windows on that partition). So what really matters is if you have MBR or GPT (which decides
 if you can create only 4 or an infinite number of primary partitions. If you can only create 4, you would need extended partitions as the other solutions suggest.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost certain that you have GPT, but well, we can check that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On Windows:</span></p>
<p>Use the command line (press Windows button and type "cmd" and then press enter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A command line window should open now. </p>
<p>Type now "diskpart" which may either open a new window or will continue in the command line window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type "list disk" there.&nbsp; This will show you a table of your harddisk and whether they are GPT or not. It may look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disk ###&nbsp; Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dyn Gpt <br />
</span><span>--------&nbsp; ------------- ------- ------- --- --- </span><span><br />
</span><span>Disk 0 &nbsp;&nbsp; Online&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br />
</span><span>Disk 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Online&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></p>
<p>In this case, Disk 1 is GPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On Linux:</span></p>
<p>In terminal, type:&nbsp; "parted - l" or "sudo parted -l"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will show you a list of your hard disks and some information. Look for the line "Partition Table". It will probably say either "msdos" (=MBR) or "gpt".</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFKAIK, the installation of Manjaro on primary partitions should be no different than installing it on an extended partition. So there should be no issues there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One noteworthy thing: Linux wants ideally 3 partitions for installation. When I tried Linux for the first time, I had some trouble understanding this because Windows makes it a lot easier for the average user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typical for Linux are a partition for root - also called "/" - for system relevant data or programs, a partition called "/home" (or similar) for your personal data (videos, documents, games, etc.) and a third partition for "swap" which is significantly smaller.
 The first two partitions are common, while a swap partition is kinda optional. Swap partitions are used to save or move data from your RAM to your Swap partition. This was common at a time, where computers had less than 1GB ram and swap partitions avoided
 freezing screens. Nowadays you dont really need them, because most PCs come with 4GB or more. If you are still worried, you can also create a swap-file (basically a file which act as a swap partition). In fact, if you are really lazy, you can also use one
 single partition for all system and personal data (but this is not recommended). (As for me, I only use 2 partitions, one for root and one for home).</p>
<p>If you are wondering how much GB you need, I suggest 40-50 GB for root and the rest for your personal home data. Optionally a swap partition as big as your RAM.</p>

            <p>It turns out my computer was GPT, which would explain why it behaved as it did. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation was able to go through with primary partitions just <span>
fine so</span> I guess I was worried for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But strangely, I don't think it installed the <span>

<span>
Windows Boot Manager</span> still. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that it's installed onto ext4 and swap <span>

            <p>Thats weird. Usually the MBR should be overwritten by Linux Grub. But that is not an issue though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Grub myself but Windows 10 Bootloader instead to boot into Linux, because that Grub Loader is so ugly.
</p>
<p>(It looks like this but with Linux instead of Win7: <a href="http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/650x300xdual-boot-windows-10-and-windows-7-or-8.png.pagespeed.ic.SBFAO5uhg0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Bootloader</a> )</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I simply downloaded and installed "<a href="http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EasyBCD 2.2</a>" (choose the Free version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just add a new startup entry with Grub 2 (or maybe GRUB) and choose the partition where you installed Manjaro and it should be fine.

            I did finally stumble on a resolution.&nbsp; I unplugged the speakers, and then with the machine on plugged them back in so the system might 'find new hardware' which it did.&nbsp;&nbsp;A setting block opened asking what I had specifically plugged in as my machine has
 several inputs for surround sound, I,e, rear speaker, front, etc.. OR<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> headphones.</span>&nbsp; So, I chose headphones as the output to my speaker system is a single plug and that did the trick!

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I got an issue with my screen display on windows7 64bit.Windows doesnt use 100% of the screen,meaning i get about 5cm black screen&nbsp;showing horizontal + vertical.The weird thing is that some games i run use 100% of the screen,so I guess the problem is cause
 of an option or something.Its a samsung syncmaster BX 2331 , and the resolution i use is 1920x1080(recomended by the windows),my graphics card is ati radeon 5770 (if it has anything to do with it).Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The monitor has controls on it which will allow you to stretch the screen both horizontally and<br />
vertically as well as center it while doing those. You may also be able to set those using controls<br />
in the computer - Right Click Desktop - Graphics Properties.<br />
<br />
Check with Samsung Support and their on-line documentation for your monitor.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the operating system updates, the drivers do not automatically update. It can cause driver incompatibility. To avoid this, ensure that your audio driver, graphics driver, and other drivers check for updates. To do so, you can go to the Device Manager
 to run a scan or visit their manufacturer's websites to download and ask for compatible drivers. If you have covered all of this aspect, we'd like to ask the following to further assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To avoid repetition, can you provide us with all the troubleshooting steps that you've done so far?</li><li>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To verify your Windows, press Windows + R to open the Run window. Type
<strong>winver </strong>and press Enter. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.<br />
</li><li>Can you please tell us what update did you perform?</li><li>After updating, have you tried restarting your computer for the update to take effect?</li></ul>
        </p>

            Hi, I have the same problem today 24.11.17 . I switched on my sony vgn-fw31zj laptop running w10 1703. after about twenty minutes I heard a short 3-note tune. When I looked at the screen, the display was small in the centre with large black surround. I
 looked in display settings and the max resolution available is now 1400 x 1050. My laptop runs at 1920x1080. Why has this happened? Last W10 updates were on 15 Nov. Any help much appreciated.

Under display device properties it shows that is it using the Microsoft Basic Display Driver instead of the manufacturer's driver.

<p>I have had exactly the same issue. Yesterday, 23 November, my display size suddenly changed and got smaller. The display settings menu would not allow me to revert back to normal. When the computer restarted the display was stretched horizontally and I could
 not re-set it.</p>
<p>I eventually went through system restore and restored back to the previous restore point. Eventually (it's a long process) it restored and all was back to normal.</p>
<p>Today, of course, windows has automatically downloaded the same update and the same problem has repeated itself.</p>
<p>Anyone have a solution?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have the same issue! Running version 1709 (OS Build 16299.64) Rolling back the driver is not an available option. Monitor is using the Microsoft Basic Display driver as well. I cannot update the driver as that is not an available option. Using ATI Radeon
 3000 series graphics. Apparently there was an issue with this Windows update - and this needs to be fixed ASAP. Request guidance like everyone here.

<p>Apparently you and I had the same issues. I had no available options to roll back drivers or update.... I followed your instructions and it worked. First off, thank you because that stretched display was BEYOND aggravating! Secondly, I hope MS comes up with
 a fix because I'm sure we aren't the only people with this issue!</p>

            Your version of WLMail gives that message when trying to add sub-folders to a Hotmail account.<br />
You can add sub-folders to pop3 accounts.

Windows RT runs on a different platform than Windows 8/8.1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Google and Mozilla would have to write their browsers for said platform. &nbsp;AFAIK - they have not done this nor do I see it happening anytime soon (given it hasn't in over a year.)

            I do not remember seeing a warning that ONLY Edge would be able to work on Win 10 update ! This seems ridiculous to force your customers to use what Win prefers . I guess I will go to a Mac too as I believe choice is the best way to satisfy customers and
 those of us who cherish freedom. I mean--does China or Korea own Microsoft now ?!

<p>In your initial post you said you were using "...the IE browser that came with the surface..." and now you're referring to Edge.&nbsp; You're apparently using Windows RT 8.1 and you're referring to "Win 10 update."&nbsp; Windows 10 isn't available for the RT platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In short, none of what you're saying makes sense.&nbsp; Can you clarify?&nbsp; Are you using Windows RT?&nbsp; If so, why the reference to Windows 10?</p>
