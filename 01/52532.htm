<h2>            Windows 10 no Connection &#40; around for 5 minutes&#41;  via remote Desktop App or a Plex Client after awaking from Sleep via WOL</h2>
                    <p>
</p><pre><span>Hello

Have a problem. I have a small Mediacenter PC. Everything is working fine. Unfortunately only so long until the PC is to be awakened.
I start the PC via WOl app on the tablet. This work fine. But I have no access for about 5 minutes on my media Contents. Say. The remote desktop app can't connect or the Plex Client does not find its server. What can it be that I can not access for 5 minutes?

Thank you</span></pre>

    <title>Processor Slowing down when battery is charging on Ac power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord_sahx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Processor Slowing down when battery is charging on Ac power</h2>
                    <p>My PC's battery failed 2 weeks ago and i got another battery from a Computer store nearby. When my battery is charging, even when its fully charged, my processor speed is below 1ghz (within 0.79 - 0.96 ghz) - even on high performance with minimum and maximum
 processor states set to 100%. However, if i remove the battery and use AC power only, the processor speed increases to max and intel Turboboost works properly. I didn't have this problem on the previous battery though and i'm still using the same charger that
 came with my PC (90 Watts ,19 Volts &nbsp;&amp; 4.74 Amps). I'm sorry if this isn't the right forum. Hp support is not letting me post with my account due to "lack of privileges". Any help or explanation on why this is happening will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PC specs:</p>
<p>Hp probook 4530s, core i7 2670QM 2.2ghz, 8gb Ram , Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S I installed the windows 10 anniversary update last week over that of November but i doubt that its the problem.</p>

Does the opposite of what i want . I need more power but the troubleshooter wants to conserve power and improve battery life. Thanks though

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Were
 you able to print using mfc-440cn brother printer before on the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Mainly the 4F error occurs due to some issues with the printer head. I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to reset the purge counter and check whether the issue is resolved. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Disconnect
 the power cord from your Brother Printer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Set button, while holding the Set button re-connect the power to your printer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 Error code will be display “Machine Error 46″</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 the Error code appear, press the “arrow up button” ( ^ ) there will be numbers that are going to be display.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Choose
 8 then press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up button again then choose Zero (0) and press Set Button Again, now you will enter Service Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 “Mono Key/Button” 25 times or until “Purge Counter Appear”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>h.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 press arrow up (^) again then choose “2″ press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up (^) again then choose “7″ press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>j.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up (^) again then choose “8″ press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>k.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up (^) again then choose “3″ press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>l.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 purge counter will be reset to Zero.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>m.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 Press Stop/Exit Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>n.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 will return to Machine Error 46</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>o.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up (^) then choose 9 press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>p.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 Arrow Up (^) again then once more choose 9 press Set Button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>q.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Your
 Printer will reset then wait until it power up again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check for foreign objects, such as a paper clip or scrap of paper, inside the machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Disconnect
 the machine from the power outlet and open the scanner cover by pulling up on the lower right corner of the cover. Look inside the machine and remove any foreign objects. If you see jammed paper or another item inside this area, gently pull it out and then
 close the scanner cover securely.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the error continues to appear, move the print head and examine under the print head.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The images shown below are from the representative product and may differ from your Brother machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Disconnect
 the Brother machine from the power outlet.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 the scanner cover by pulling up on the lower right corner of the cover.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Check
 the print head's position.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Gently
 move the print head to the center.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Examine
 under the print head. If anything is found, remove it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Hint:</span></strong><span> Use a flashlight if necessary to check thoroughly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Close
 the cover and reconnect the machine to the power outlet.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the message continues to appear on the LCD, the print head will need to be replaced which is the part of the machine the ink cartridges are inserted into.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Be careful not to force the print head to move. If the print head is positioned at the far right
 hand side, you cannot move it. Please contact Brother Customer Service for further assistance. Check the link mentioned below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile check whether the latest drivers are installed on the system. If not, I would suggest you to download the latest drivers from the link mentioned below and
 check whether you are able to print.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/download_index.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfc440cn_all&amp;dlid=&amp;flang=English&amp;os=74&amp;type2=-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/download_index.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfc440c<span>n_all&amp;dlid=&amp;flang=English&amp;os=74&amp;type2=-1</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

                    <p>Original Title: Surface 2 falls asleep while watching YouTube videos</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface 2 device was not able to watch YouTube videos. It was kind of hit and miss for a but it seems to be doing fine now. However, is it common with this new player that the Surface will go to sleep mid-video? I had that happen a couple times and I
 was confused as to why. </p>

</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Follow the steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When your RT device is sharing/streaming music, video, or other media via a program such as Windows Media Center, Windows doesn’t automatically count the streaming as an activity. Thus, if you aren’t actually using the device
 for any other purposes, then this will be considered as being in the idle state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thus, to prevent this behavior, we need to set the device to
<strong><em>Prevent idling to sleep</em></strong> for the option <strong><em>Plugged in</em></strong> from the

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To save a little energy, choose <strong><em>Allow the computer to enter Away mode</em></strong>, which makes a device appear to be sleeping even though it’s not. As this is not a true sleep state, and won’t conserve much energy,
 don’t choose this setting when running on the battery as it may consume a lot of energy when compared to the Sleep State.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please follow these steps and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>

<p>So I made some great friends playing the original "Gears".</p>
<p>I also had some great games because back then players spoke with each other.</p>
<p>Would you be happy to see GOWUE release with Party Chat disabled for MP or would you prefer to not be able to communicate with your Teammates?</p>

<p>It won't affect me as I'm not buying this but ...</p>
<p>If there was a game I really wanted that released with Party Chat disabled, sure I would give it a go, see what the overall community was like. If it was like a lot of games these days where you meet a lot of what I call the wannabe internet gangsters then
 I'd just turn the volume right down on the mic or not bother wearing it unless I was playing with a few friends/family.</p>
<p>I would much rather though developers give gamers the option. There's a lot of gamers like me about where the vast majority of online gaming is spent with people we know in Party Chat so there's plenty of friendly communication.</p>

<p>I guess it's up to the developers. It's like in COD Black Ops 2, you're not allowed to be in Party Chat when playing Search and Destroy, it even brings up that Microsoft Xbox 360 Dashboard UI menu box if you're in Party Chat. In COD AW on Xbox 1, it doesn't
 allow you to use Xbox 1's Kinect for game chat. And I played Forza Horizon (the first one) on Xbox 360. I was idle for a while, and the game brought up the Microsoft Xbox 360 Dashboard UI box saying I was kicked for being idle too long. Sometimes I think can't
 developers use their own menu's without using the Dashboard UI. I know Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition uses the Xbox 360's Dashboard UI menu's instead of using their own menu's. OK... when games bring up the Xbox Dashboard UI boxes, sometimes my heart sinks, because
 it's using a menu/UI/dashboard/OS which runs your console. Each time it brings up a dashboard menu notification instead of creating their own menu's... saying I've been kicked, or I'm not allowed to do something, it feels like I've been told of by Microsoft.
 I also know in Halo Reach they put you on probation or give temporary bans on not just your profile but your console too, if you quit out games even if you only quit a few times, you're stop earning XP Points or something, I had that happened to me twice.
 It's not an Xbox ban, it's just the game developers. Sometimes I feel it's good game developers force you into game chat. That's why if you want a chatty lobby in a game like COD BO2, you go play Search and Destroy, but you could also play zombies because
 lots of people play that who are chatty. And people who play zombies most of them are in game chat, NOT party. But there are advantages of being in party chat compared to game chat, especially when comparing to Xbox 360 when game chat can quickly become static
 garble. But surprisingly enough, COD BO2 lobbies the game chat channel is very clear. But there are times when your want a private chat party or you want to chat with 8 people doing different things on your console, that is the advantage of party chat, otherwise
 you can mute mute mute whoever you want in game chat.</p>

<p>@ iBakez ...</p>
<p>Xbox LIVE definitely isn't what it use to be. A lot of friends I still have on my list today I met on games like Project Gotham Racing, Call of Duty 2. Sure you always met the odd idiot but LIVE such a more friendly place back then.</p>
<p>Call of Duty 2, over all the community was fantastic, we got to Call of Duty 4 and even though there was still great people playing but there was ALOT more idiots. Maybe because more people were playing 4 than 2 so along with the good you get more of the
 bad? dunno ...</p>
<p>I've said before I often think it was when games started introducing leaderboards, K/D ratio's etc that caused a lot of problems. People got too serious about their stats and a lot of the fun went out of gaming?
</p>
<p>I know a lot of people blame Party Chat for how LIVE is today, less people talking but I'd personally take it every day of the week. I'd much rather be in a party with friends/family than listening to the people who keep telling me what they want to do to
 my mum lol</p>

<p>I find that if you're willing to take the time to go into game chat and communicate during a shooter like Gears of War (even if nobody responds), it can go a long way - I often tell others where the enemy is located, for example, and many people appreciate
 and use that to their advantage to improve their quality of fun through winning. It's a good way to make friends! Sure, there's going to be the odd one out that tells me to shut up or who won't shut up in turn, but you can't get the reward without taking a
 risk 1st... ;)</p>

<p>XBox LIVE matchmaking on the 360 did tend to lump you with the sort of people you like to play with.</p>
<p>Remember you got to set your profile to the type of gamer you were and it sounds like some of the people above may have set it to "Street" or whatever it was because they told themselves "I don't mind a bit of banter".</p>
<p>Only to discover that they didn't really want a bit of banter. &nbsp;They just thought they did.</p>
<p>It took me ages to find the abusive racist banter I was promised was the staple of any FPS on the 360... and even then I only got it the once in a game of UNO and then it was just a case of Mute, block, avoid and move on.</p>
<p>So not much sympathy for those who kept finding themselves in the peanut gallery as it probably had more to do with their personal play style and conduct than they actually realised.</p>
<p>Disabling party chat for MP in this game would be a great thing for those who are playing who enjoy games. &nbsp;I can see it being an obstacle if you're there for something else.</p>
<p>Wouldn't really need forcing on the rest of the game though.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"Disabling party chat for MP in this game would be a great thing for those who are playing who enjoy games." ...</strong></span></p>
<p>It would be great for those who want it but quite a few don't so I just hope most developer's continue to give gamers the option.</p>
<p>I guess I'm lucky, I have quite a few friends/family that share my interest in games so I know when a new game comes out there will be enough playing to be able to party up and start gaming, plenty of communication so it's great.</p>
<p>For those that maybe don't have friends/family that share their interest in games then of course it would be great to go online and talk to random people. Again though I just hope developers continue to give gamers the option.</p>
<p>Thinking of it though, people often say Party Chat has killed the social aspect of Xbox LIVE, no one talking etc but has it really? Again it's not good for those that don't have many friends that share their interest in games but you go into an online game
 and no-one is talking, why? I'd say because most are doing what I do, their sitting in Parties with friends etc having a great laugh so the social side is still there I'd say.</p>

<p>So exactly how much Gears did you play "back in the day"? obviously not much if you never came across any of the issues others did. &nbsp;Unless you were playing co-op with a mate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I don't believe those settings on the 360 made a jot of difference in matchmaking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are using a pre-release Evaluation version of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evaluation copy expires tomorrow (January 16, 2014). When it expires the system will start shutting down every 2 Hours and you will lose any unsaved work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to contact the Administrator for the Dreamspark program at your school and ask about obtaining a Final Version 6.3 (Build 9600) of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what the winver window will look like for the final version.</p>

<p>If you have a laptop, it's not so easy to replace anything.&nbsp; You could try attaching an external monitor, but that really wouldn't test your laptop's monitor.&nbsp; On laptops, video cards are frequently built into the motherboard and so they cannot be removed
 and reseated (plus it would be very difficult to get to it even if it was a separate card).&nbsp; In the case of a laptop, you can try updating the device drivers for the monitor and the video card to see if that helps.&nbsp; If not, then I recommend you take it to
 a reputable computer repair shop for service.</p>
<p>If it is a desktop, then try what Rick recommended (though I would also try to update the monitor driver if it has one as well as the video card driver just in case that helps).&nbsp; When you replace the parts, be certain that they are compatible with your computer
 system (including the motherboard if it is the video card) and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
also</span> compatible with your version of Vista.&nbsp; I suggest that instead of using the drivers on the CD that comes with the device, you go to the manufacturer's web site and download the most recent versions so you will be up-to-date.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you have the means, attach a different monitor. If the problem remains, the cause is the video card. If not, you need to replace the monitor.</p>
<p>If it's the video card, updating drivers may help. It may also be caused by the card not being seated properly in its motherboard slot, and reseating may help. You may find that you need to replace the card.</p>

<p>Then one assumes KB4035631 is your troublemaker. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: KB4035631 is a Servicing Stack update which cannot be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: Even if you could uninstall it, that wouldn't restore your Update History. [Note that Installed Updates isn't blank/empty.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: When you upgrade to (install) the Creators Update, your Update History will be wiped out again anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above notwithstanding, please answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did&nbsp;you do a clean install of Win10,&nbsp;or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Have you ever run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> and/or the
<strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>

<p>Just noticed something else.&nbsp; Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 has downloaded twice that I'm aware of since yesterday.&nbsp; Now it's downloading again.&nbsp; It must be a large file because I had to purchase 2 additional GB from satellite provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Purchased Jan 2016</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Preinstalled with Win 10 Pro (64-bit) but have reinstalled OS several times since then due to problems that seem to appear after every Windows update.&nbsp; Turns out when turning computer on, PC lost path to monitor plugged into AMD video card.&nbsp; Hard drive
 replaced, motherboard replaced, reinstalled OS, reformatted hard drives w/reinstall OS...nothing seems to make a difference.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Dell XPS 8700</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Shipped with McAfee but not installed when reinstalling OS.&nbsp; Use Windows Defender.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Completely reformatting hard drives w/reinstall of OS, and replacement of hard drive and motherboard should have negated need for use of Norton or McAfee removal tool.</p>

<p>Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell tech support resolved my issues after working about 3-1/2 hours on the PC.&nbsp; The thinking is that a failed install of Windows version 1703 caused a number of problems.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't tell you all that they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no simple fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that at the end, they were able to set the Windows Update service to manual.&nbsp; This now allows me to control when the updates happen.&nbsp; Anytime massive updates don't occur within the free zone (midnight to 5 am) I end up having to purchase
 addition satellite internet GBs.&nbsp; When they fail to install repeatedly like 1703 has, it rapidly sucks even more GBs and costs skyrocket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest and efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's consider this&nbsp; question closed and resolved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So far, in the last two days, I've had 8 failed installs of 1703.&nbsp; In the same time period this has caused me to have to purchases additional GBs of satellite internet service 4 times (the privilege of owning and using Win 10 is getting d....med expensive)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the Dell tech had reconfigured the Windows Update Service so that it would download and update manually.&nbsp; So...it looks like we are going through a 9th attempt.&nbsp; Thanks Microsoft :(</p>

    <title>Limited internet on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ali brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Limited internet on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I realise there have been several posts on this subject, so let me just start off by saying I have read everything I can find on the subject and tried every single fix. None have worked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For around a week and a half (not entirely sure when exactly) my internet has been showing the yellow warning sign on the icon for internet access on the taskbar. When pressed the current connection says 'Limited'. My access to the internet via internet
 explorer 11 is pretty sound, and I have not experienced any internet dropouts, however many Windows apps and functions that require an internet connection no longer work properly. Such examples are Skydrive (This was what originally brought the problem to
 my attention as I was trying to set it up and it told me that it could not connect) and Windows Update (I can view around 18 updates to be installed, but when trying to download them it gets stuck on 0%).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was at the time using a Netgear WNA1100 wireless adapter for my internet, which at the point of updating to windows 8.1 gave me problems as there was incompatibility with the new OS. I had managed to fix that, and my internet was working fine up until
 this new 'Limited' problem arose. I have&nbsp;today upgraded to the Netgear WNA3100M which has Windows 8 compatibility and a beta driver for 8.1 but unfortunately this did not solve my problem. I have also just today started with a new ISP, transferring from BT
 Total Broadband to TalkTalk. I had wondered if this was the underlying problem, as I had started the process around the same time as the problem arose, however no other computer or device had any problem during the switchover&nbsp;(There is a Windows 7 PC, a MacBook
 Pro on the latest Mac OS, two Ipod touch's, and a few phones including&nbsp;one with&nbsp;Windows Phone 8).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried hooking the PC up to the router with an Ethernet cable, and I still had the problem. I have tried updating/rolling-back the drivers of BOTH wireless adapters, to no avail. I have tried manually entering the correct IP address into the settings
 (Something that Microsoft seem adamant is the problem with everyone's limited access problems) and this did not work. I have tried using system restore to the earliest setting, and after a long wait was told that the restore had failed (although it was pretty
 happy to delete a good 20GB of games that I had spent hours downloading off of Steam and Origin). I have also tried the command prompt purging commands that admittedly flew a little bit over my technical understanding (just copied the commands in and prayed),
 but unfortunately this did not work either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a theory, however. The only other things that have changed between everything being fine and everything going pear-shaped is a few windows updates. The last successful updates are Definition Updates for&nbsp;Windows Defender - KB2267602.&nbsp;The last three
 ,going backwards,&nbsp;are Definition 1.165.3217.0 (installed 03/02/2014), Definition 1.165.3153.0 (installed 02/02/2014) and Definition 1.165.3112.0 (installed 01/02/2014). Could these updates possibly contain the problem?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried to be thorough with the details, as I am trying to avoid the same old fixes that I already know not to work with my situation. I apologise, however, for this being so long. I have tried to provide all fixes that I have attempted, however I might
 have tried more. If you have any fix suggestions not already listed, please feel free to let me know, and I will reply saying whether I have tried it already, or if it finally solves my problem. Also, if you need any other information about the problem or
 my current software/hardware, I am happy to provide it if I can.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Big thanks to anyone willing to read all this and help me out.</p>

            <p>Ah, unfortunately i must have failed to explain something. The netgear device is a wireless adapter for the pc with the problem. As for routers, when on bt i was using the dedicated bt homehub 2.0 and now with TalkTalk i am using their dedicated d-link router.
 They both were already set up for using with their respective internet service providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you have made an interesting point though, when it comes to the firewall settings. I will look into that and get back to you with the results. Many thanks for the quick reply.</p>

            <p>Right, after looking through firewall settings, all was as it should be. The two protocols that you have showed are both operational. I have checked in the wireless adapter settings and it says that DHCP is enabled. 'ipconfig/all' in command confirms this.&nbsp;Two
 things&nbsp;that strike me as odd is that even though I can connect to the internet through internet explorer (therefore there must be a connection) in the network and sharing centre the basic information is not available - it just says 'unknown' and 'the dependency
 service or group failed to start'. Also, if I go to Network Settings, right click on the network adapter and click status it says that IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity is 'Not Connected'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This just doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On a side note, I think I have ruled out the windows updates being the problem. they were all updates to windows defender, so I tried disabling windows defender. No improvement. Also, disabling the windows firewall does nothing to fix the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have any further ideas, I would appreciate anything you suggest, if not thanks for trying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also a shout out, if anyone else has an idea, hook me up, I'm all ears.</p>

<p><strong>To answer your original question directly, you can't do it using only Command Prompt</strong>.&nbsp; You need to use one of the products provided above using the procedures provided above (or find another alternative - there are probably other options
 available but this seems like an adequate number to provide as recommendations).</p>
<p>What additional help do you require?&nbsp; We've answered your question.&nbsp; We've provided many ways to accomplish the objective of making a bootable recovery disk even if none&nbsp;were exactly the way you requested because that can't be done&nbsp;(though one that re-installs
 would have to be obtained from the manufacturer or borrowed from someone with a genuine Vista Installation Disk of the same bit-size).</p>
<p>I don't know what else to say.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3&#59; Sleep -&#62; Blue Screen of Death -&#62; Restart</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a SP3 with the Surface Dock connected. Windows 10 ver1607 (OS Build 14393.576). Was purchased July 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I updated the firmware on the Surface Dock (using the "MS Surface Dock Updater") and call it coincidence but ever since then, I've been having issues when the SP3 goes to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what happens is that sometimes it will go to sleep, sometimes it wont. When it does go to sleep, the screen goes black but the backlight stays on. Then after a little while in that state, it will come up with the following BSOD error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94330245-f49f-4fff-8061-d2ed5b3538a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94330245-f49f-4fff-8061-d2ed5b3538a9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From there it will restart. When it restarts it seems to get stuck for quite a long time on the Surface splash screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the SP3 is not connected to the Surface Dock, this issue does not occur.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find&nbsp; a Dolby Audio Driver for my Lenovo G585 for the Windows 10 OS (that works). I've&nbsp;been on the Lenovo site but no luck with the drivers they have available. I'm really missing the sound that used to come out of my laptop :(</p>
<p>Is there ANYONE out there with an answer?</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox One S disconnects from Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghostbrewer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S disconnects from Xbox Live</h2>
                    I am having an issue with my One S. Every 30 minutes I get disconnected from multiplayer games. It doesn't matter what game i play it can be Anthem, Destiny 2 or Division.&nbsp; I will be part of a party playing and voice chat with friends and the game disconnects
 but I can still chat with the party. So it seems that the internet doesn't disconnect just the service from playing online. I am open NAT'ed, I have a static IP address reservation and a wired connection (this issue also happens on wireless). I have switched
 network cables and ports on the router.&nbsp; At this point I am at a loss on what to try next, hence my posting here.

<p>you wouldn't believe how happy I am to see this post. I'm sorry to say that but I've been dealing with this exact problem for going on 2 years and it seems like nobody believes me. only thing that I'm not sure about is if it happens to me every 30 minutes,
 might have been more often than that for me. if your ISP is att that is the problem though it's extremely difficult to get att to admit that it's their equipment that is the problem. if you don't have att and wouldn't mind, could you tell me who ur ISP is
 so that I can continue looking into this because I'm still having issues just less often. oh and the problem is that no att hardware supports UPnP (if that's ur ISP anyway), &amp; it's nearly impossible to get them to admit it&nbsp;</p>

            So I tried putting my Xbox in a DMZ and still had the same issue where I would drop off of the multiplayer game every 30 minutes but still would be able to party chat with the other players.&nbsp; I guess my next step is to call the ISP and see what they say.

<p>Hi Ghost,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses. When you contact your ISP, make sure to have them inspect all physical connections and check for any issues in wiring for your network. Small kinks or misconnections can cause issues with your network's connection and it's reliability.
 Also, you may want to inquire about swapping your equipment (router &amp; modem) just in case your current devices provided by the ISP are faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how this goes.</p>

<p>Hi GhostBrewer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried running a Detailed network statistics test in your Xbox One's network settings? This will give you detailed numbers on the different protocols that are important in staying connected to Xbox Live. If you haven't done so, I recommend running
 the test and then letting us know all of the results to see if there is any outlier that we need to look at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also putting your Xbox in a DMZ perimeter network is usually reserved for last, but it could be that the UPnP protocol in the router is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know your network results and what your ISP says if you contacted them.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade - Directx 11</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so, yesterday I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I downloaded WildStar onto my PC because I want to stream it on Twitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WildStar plays perfectly on my laptop, which has lower specs than my PC, I'm just</p>
<p>not able to stream on my laptop because it can't handle it.</p>
<p>So after downloading WildStar, I clicked play and was presented with the "could not find a Direct3D device". Apparently this is a known issue as there is a support page for it on the WildStar support site. I did everything they told me to do and still nothing
 worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did a lot of googling and figured out that it must be something to do with DirectX. So I checked out what DirectX I had on my laptop and my PC.</p>
<p>What do you know? My laptop has DirectX 11.2 but my PC has DirectX 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought all I had to do was download DirectX 11 and voila, I'd be able to play WildStar.</p>
<p>Apparently not because according to Microsoft there is no stand alone download for DirectX 11. From what I've gathered to get it on Windows 10, you have to have had it with Windows 8/8.1 and then when you upgrade to Windows 10, you automatically have it
 integrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I didn't upgrade from Windows 8.1, I upgraded from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I don't know what to do. I have tried everything that is physically possible. I've checked to see if my graphics card drivers need updating but they don't. There is nothing else for me to do. I am completely stuck and any help would be greatly appreciated
 before I crack up and possibly kill myself or my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
You can also manually download and apply the following update package that updates DirectX to the latest version.
</p><ul>
<li>DirectX 11.2 is included in Windows 8.1, Windows RT and Windows Server 2012 R2.
<br />
<span>Note</span> There is no standalone update package for DirectX 11.2. You can only install this DirectX version through
<a href="http://update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Update</span></a> in Windows 8.1, Windows RT and Windows Server 2012 R2.</li><li>DirectX 11.1 for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Platform Update for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 (KB2670838)</span></a></li></ul>
</li><li>DirectX 11.0 for Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Update for Windows Vista (KB971512)</span></a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Update for Windows Server 2008 (KB971512)</span></a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Update for Windows Vista for x64-based Systems (KB971512)</span></a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=12870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Update for Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems (KB971512)</span></a></li></ul>
</li><li>DirectX 9.0c for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=34429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Download DirectX 9.0c End-User Runtime</span></a></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<div>
<div>
Some applications and games require DirectX 9. However, your computer includes a more recent version of DirectX. If you install and then run an application or game that requires DirectX 9, you might receive an error message such as "The program can't start
 because d3dx9_35.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."
<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, go to the following Microsoft website to install DirectX End-User Runtime:
<div><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=159853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer</span></a></div>
<span>Note</span> When you run this package, no change is made to your version of DirectX, Direct3D 9, Direct3D 10.x, Direct3D 11.x, DirectInput, DirectSound, DirectPlay, DirectShow, or DirectMusic.
<br />
<br />
List of file failures that the DirectX End-User Runtime package fixes
<div>If you experience issues in which an application fails because any of the following files are missing, you may be able to resolve the failure by running the DirectX run-time package:
<ul>
<li>D3DX9_24.DLL through D3DX9_43.DLL</li><li>D3DX10.DLL through D3DX10_43.DLL</li><li>D3DCompiler_33.DLL through D3DCompiler_43.DLL</li><li>D3DX11_42.DLL</li><li>D3DX11_43.DLL</li><li>D3DCSX_42.DLL</li><li>D3DCSX_43.DLL</li><li>XACTENGINE2_0.DLL through XACTENGINE2_9.DLL</li><li>XACTENGINE3_0.DLL through XACTENGINE3_7.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_0.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_1.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_2.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_3.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_4.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_5.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_6.DLL</li><li>XAUDIO2_7.DLL</li><li>XAPOFX1_0.DLL through XAPOFX1_5.DLL</li><li>X3DAUDIO1_0.DLL through X3DAUDIO1_7.DLL</li><li>XINPUT1_1.DLL</li><li>XINPUT1_2.DLL</li><li>XINPUT1_3.DLL</li></ul>
<strong>To check which version of DirectX is on your computer, follow these steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>
Search</strong>. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.) Type <span>dxdiag</span> in the search box, and then tap on click
<strong>dxdiag.exe</strong>.<br />
Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, type <span>
dxdiag</span> in the search box, and then press Enter.
Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, and then click Run. Type
<span>dxdiag</span> in the <strong>Run</strong> box, and then press Enter.</li><li>Click the <strong>System</strong> tab, and then, under <strong>
System Information</strong>, check the DirectX version number.</li></ol>
<span>Note</span> Currently, DirectX Diagnostic Tool may show DirectX 11 as the DirectX version number for DirectX 11.2 and DirectX 11.1.

            <p>Thank you for the reply but as it turns out, I am the biggest idiot alive. My PC doesn't have a graphics card. All the games I played on it in the past didn't need a graphics card to play them, but WildStar does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I need is a graphics card that runs DirectX 11 and is suitable for an Intel G41 Express Chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestion go right ahead haha.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have the down arrow (for highest to lowest usage in descending order) set in the CPU column, set it in the Disk column instead to see the same. Switch to the Performance tab and click on the Disk row and then you can see the write and read rates individually.</p>

<p>Hello Jamshedsalik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some software may require high-end specifications in order to function properly. If the high disk usage issue only occurs when running
<em>Android</em> <em>Studio</em>, there might be a misconfiguration with the app that needs correction. That being said, it would be great if you can tell us more about your concern.</p>

<p>It is not showing that the disk is full, it is showing that the read/write activity to be high. In the case of 100% the disk is at the highest (fastest) that it is able to perform the read/write processes being required of it, in other words, the greater
 amount of data that needs to write to and/or read from the physical HDD the higher the disk usage will be for a longer period of time. This is why many people these days chose to upgrade to SSD's (solid state drives) as they can transfer data at much higher
 speeds than an HDD can do to the fact that a SSD has no moving parts at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the question here is, is the program that you are using that data intensive that this could be considered normal or is there a software/driver/process conflict causing the same function to repeat over and over again trying to complete it
 successfully and it cannot. That is were the diagnostics come in. Now, often this can be caused by outdated software products (or 3rd party drivers) that need to be updated to a newer version. If said products are no longer being supported however this is
 not possible, in this case the thing to try would be to attempt to run the program in compatibility mode.</p>

            Microsoft does not have a true fix for this.&nbsp; I work for a small medical clinic and I have run into this on several computers and rarely is there a real solution.&nbsp; I am convinced that after trying everything on each of the 6 out of 15 computers in the
 building that the only thing that truly works is switching to another OS.&nbsp; Every computer I have band aid fixed, still has the problem intermittently. Following each step of each fix out there is a time consuming mess. The only computer that doesn't have the
 issue anymore is the one I finally loaded the latest Ubuntu Linux build on.&nbsp; Still have everything I need on that computer without slowness, it actually seems faster than regular Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Don't believe the "Solved" threads on this issue and watch out
 for the advertising solutions of downloading drivers, this issue has no real fix, and instead of Microsoft fixing the issue with a patch/update, they just take our money and give us a band aid for our troubles. Pre

<p>I can say this - I only see this on my laptop, I thought I fixed it initially after reading an article that if I put the laptop into conservative CPU usage, it will cause this.&nbsp; But I'm not 100% sure if that was the cause - because recently it's back.&nbsp; The
 main time I see it happening is when Chrome is open.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if it's due to some rogue JS o a webpage, possibly even a crypto coin miner - even though&nbsp;I do run an extension that's supposed to block those.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Norton picks up some JS at times from unsuspecting
 web pages that wants to run a Bitcoin or Monero coin miner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far today, when I closed out of Chrome and moved to Microsoft Edge,&nbsp; it has not gone back to 100% usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine comes to a crawl when that happens.&nbsp; I'd think 'virtual memory' also might be a culprit, but I don't see the system maxing out on RAM
 by process list.&nbsp; Which lends back to the theory it might be some rogue JS that's doing something so expensive in memory?&nbsp; it's forcing virtual disk usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps anyone in trying to understand what causes this.&nbsp; It is tricky to track down.

Thanks for bring this up with much details. <span>Before we proceed, please read this note:</span><br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note: The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><em>How
 to back up and restore the registry in Windows.</em></span></a></span></span></span></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
To start, the 100% disk usage was a known issue way back the previous builds of Windows 10. Try to keep your System updated. Another option is to try the fix that was released by Microsoft Engineers some time ago:</p>

 on Windows 10 devices with Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode enabled.</strong></span></em></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be a case wherein the <em><strong>MSISupported</strong></em> value would be missing under the registry. Please follow the step-by-step guide provided here:

            <p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I didn't adequately explain my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it is not a "restore down" problem, per se.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you an example -- say&nbsp;I am working within a given program wherein I am writing HTML.&nbsp; Then, to see the results of my script, I hit a view link button.&nbsp; A pop-up results showing me the result of my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might do this in a given session 40 or 50 times.&nbsp; My problem is where the pop-up occurs on top&nbsp;of my window.&nbsp; The location may be inconvenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, half of the pop-up may be off the&nbsp;window and I have to drag it to&nbsp;good locale.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, each&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp;within the same work session keeps popping up in the same inconvenient locale.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time I drag the pop-up to&nbsp;a proper place, do some work, then close the window - upon reopening, same wrong locale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;original question should have been how to&nbsp;I control a pop-up so that it opens in the same place of my choosing each time with the same pre-set size.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pop-up never&nbsp;reopens in the same location&nbsp;it was in when it last closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is prompted because every so often, the pop-up opens in a new location and will stay there for perhaps a 100 pop-ups and then arbitrarily start opening in a new location for a period of time.&nbsp; I need to be able to control where a pop-up opens
 as well as the size.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, on my computer, "Windows Key + X" opens my Windows Mobility Center.&nbsp; I did locate my display adapters but I&nbsp;had the latest.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;have been operating with the recommended screen resolution.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I get the CLR Error: 80004005 when I boot up in Windows 7. It happens when certain programs start during bootup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I have tried to install certain programs, the program requires .NET but thinks it is not installed.&nbsp; I have 4.51 installed. I have used the .NET cleanup tool to remove all evidence of .NET programs, then reinstalled 4.5. Also, .NET 4 would not
 install. Thanks for your help. </p>

            <p>Finally found a&nbsp;solution. I am posting as I have fought this&nbsp;issue for over a&nbsp;year!&nbsp;You may want to create a Restore point before proceeding just in case it does not work for you, so you can easily return to original state of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a>&nbsp;and download the .Net Framework&nbsp;cleanup tool. Run and remove all versions of .Net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the latest version of .Net - 4.5 as of now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;this&nbsp;folder:&nbsp;C:\Windows\<span>Microsoft.NET</span>.&nbsp; Look for a folder called "assembly". Rename it assembly2 (or something diferent).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall the .Net program. Should work now unless you have other issues (and you may).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a FYI - my computer would not load .NET v 4,, but did successfully load 4.51 OK.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update - What Happens to my Windows 7 Key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old laptop originally had Vista and now has Windows 7 (which I purchased after).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know if I upgrade the laptop to Windows 10 that license for Windows 10 get's tied to that PC.&nbsp; Since the laptop is around 7 years old it likely doesn't have much time left on this world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is what happens to my windows 7 key?&nbsp; When old faithful goes to the large mainframe in the sky, can I still use my Winodws 7 disk to install on a different PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because since I purchased the full version of windows 7 I would hate to loose the capability to use that copy of Windows 7 when my laptop dies.</p>

            <p>Someone from a community can give a definitive answer to this question if they have done this themselves.&nbsp; This forum isn't really a place for personal opinion as someone should only try and answer a question with a way to find an answer or "this worked"/"this
 did not work".&nbsp; As for the Terms and Conditions/ Official documentation, they do not clarify on a situation like this.<br />
</p>
<p>The first reply to this thread was done by a support engineer.&nbsp; Now that might be just a title given to a person with a few helpful posts or an actual Microsoft representative.&nbsp; I think most people would assume the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that cause it not unreasonable
 to expect a definitive answer.&nbsp; He gave a "may"/maybe answer which is why I asked him to clarify (which i still hope for a reply).</p>
