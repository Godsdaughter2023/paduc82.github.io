    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar&#58; pinned icons don&#39;t highlight on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kh456  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar&#58; pinned icons don&#39;t highlight on mouseover&#47;hover</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 Taskbar has several app icons pinned to it. Each icon correctly opens an app when clicked on, and when an app is open, its Taskbar icon is highlighted and underlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when the apps are not open and you mouseover/hover over the same pinned Taskbar icons, the highlight has stopped appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet if I mouseover/hover over an icon in the Quick Launch toolbar, the icons that appear there do in fact get the highlight--so the problem occurs strictly on the pinned Taskbar icons.<br />
</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 installed on two machines. It works fine on the other machine, but not on this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine also suffered the dreaded (and still-unsolved) Cortana/Start Menu/critical error bug. I fixed that by going back to an earlier restore point before that problem happened. But could this Taskbar hover/highlight bug be related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix it or troubleshoot it?</p>

            I seem to have solved the problem by adjusting the Taskbar colors/transparency settings and also running the Windows fixes built into Tweaking.com Free from Safe Mode, which was recommended on another Windows trouble-shooting website. Now the highlights
 have returned. My guess is that the transparency settings and/or color settings under certain circumstances lose track of the hight, perhaps related to a permissions issue that Tweaking.com fixed.

<h2>            Conexant audio missing - ASUS</h2>
                    <p>I opened my computer from sleep to find that the audio was no longer working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, the audio icon says "No speakers or headphones are plugged in." When I run the Microsoft diagnostics, it says "Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates." I've tried this without fix. It then says "Device is not plugged in" and
 then offers no other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the device manager, the Conexant Audio driver the computer came with is no longer under the sound tab. There is only "AMD High Definition Audio Device". Therefore, I can't click to update drivers through the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the ASUS website and downloaded the most updated driver for my computer model. When I extract the files and then click to run the install program (as administrator), it does not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Windows had updated to version 1809 the night before this all started. I removed the update; this did not resinstate my audio driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how I can reinstall Conexant Audio to my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS X555QA</p>
<p>Windows 10 version 1803 (after removing 1809).</p>

</p><p>I have already tried that (and just tried again with your link). After downloading the driver, I try to click the install program file to initiate installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, nothing further happens after I click the install program file. I check the processes manager and it shows it's 'running' but nothing happens. I open it as an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another way to run the installation file?</p>

    <title>Unknown folder icon in the Control Panel of Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unknown folder icon in the Control Panel of Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my Start Menu and click on Control Panel, there is an unknown program there with a folder&nbsp;icon. I have tried to click on the folder icon to open it but that doesn't work, and I can't open it. I have attached a screenshot of the folder icon below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90ab1f51-504e-42f9-a57f-f7cd63c6b442?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90ab1f51-504e-42f9-a57f-f7cd63c6b442?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder icon is the one that's highlighted in blue. Does anyone know how to get rid of it? Please post your solution here, thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Riel Alc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed an antivirus app prior to this issue, but I don't think that is the cause of the problem. This is not the first time this problem has occurred, and&nbsp;I have tried to reset my laptop many times to its original factory setting and the problem is
 gone. However, after opening the Start Menu from my desktop a few times, the problem comes back again&nbsp;even if&nbsp;no app is installed prior to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder icon is not visible when I open the Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to scan my computer (laptop)&nbsp;with my Windows Defender anti-virus and&nbsp;it does not detect any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Canon and HP make small, portable printers and the HP model has MFC capabilities minus faxing.&nbsp; The Canon model does not come with a battery kit and once you get the kit, plus IrDA and Bluetooth, would run about $400.&nbsp; The HP model is a little less and everything
 is built in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To work without a router remotely, you need Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both models should also work with the RT as well (at least the HP model).&nbsp; I plan on getting the HP model myself next month for my RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the model numbers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP Officejet 150 Mobile CN550A All-in-One Printer </p>
<p>Canon PIXMA IP100 Portable Photo Color Inkjet Printer </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found both at TigerDirect.com and they also have a few older HP models as well (without the battery and some other features).</p>

<p>Any ideas? I'm at a&nbsp;loss!&nbsp; <br />
Thought it was related to a yellow error on a hidden device in Device Manager but still don't know how to fix.<br />
Could swear I ran sfc /scannow<br />
Afraid to run any removal tools.</p>
<p>Nothing comes up when I run Windows Update w/Microsoft updates.</p>

<h2>            how many people would buy a 14-15 inch Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to never have to use a full size laptop again after using my Surface RT and Surface 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the screen size on the Surface Pro 2 is the same size as the Surface 2, so&nbsp;I don't have&nbsp; a ton of reason to get the Pro 2 when I still have a working laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious, how many people would be interested in a</p>
<p>
</p><p>13 inch Surface Pro 3</p>
<p>14-15 inch Surface Pro 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you be willing to pay $2,000 - 4,000 for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would pay 4k for a 15 inch Surface Pro 3 if it had a matte / non-glare touch screen with amazing wacom stylus and had the same computing power as MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 15 inch top of the line laptop.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, as for the iPad Pro - Apple shelved it. &nbsp;They are not going to bring it to market (yet).</p>

</p><p>As for paying $4,000 for a tablet? &nbsp;It better be made of 24k GOLD!!!!!!</p>

            2000$ is no so much if we think the gains we will have with a 14 inch surface pro...especially on-field activities...I am telecom engineer and I have a dell e6420 with fairly autonomy, but best batteries are not only expensive, but also heavy. You laptop
 becames heavy and you loose mobility. 14inch screen is important to display many windows of measurement tools. I also need a good camera do take picture s and notebook and pen to takes notes, compass, gps, maps,wireless SIM card dongle, etc...so is to much
 stuff in my backpack which becames heavier and heavier every time I add more stuff on it. So, 14 inch surface pro with 3 USB ports,umts/lte SIM card adapter and with a pen to take notes will give a great improve in terms of mobility.i am also convicted that
 companies would replace employees traditional laptops for this surface pro, because employees would more mobility and could work outside office in public transports, home, on-field, and office costs would decrease (water, electricity, pape

            <p>Same here. <strong>I'd LOVE to have a 13-14 inch Surface Pro</strong> with screen proportions akin to an A4 sheet of paper. Preferably but not necessarily, of a size similar size to the Surface 3 Pro, but with a thinner bezel around the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I like the current Surface 3 Pro model, it does come short in certain hardware aspects, which are quite important in my view - namely it lacks&nbsp;<strong>GPS, NFC, and LTE modules</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the device is supposed to be fully suited for business, it could use a SmartCard slot, a fingerprint/palm vein reader, a Kensington lock, and other security-related features, such as full hard drive encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other areas could be improved upon as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>the keyboard </strong>(should be a chicklet one with good key travel and rubberised keys for a premium feel.; adding an extra trackpoint to the existing trackpad wouldn't hurt either. oh, and &nbsp;a single-row Enter key is a no-go for me)</p>
<p>- <strong>the digitiser </strong>(the nTrig design leaves some room for improvement in order to outperform the Wacom's digitiser, i.e. hovering cursor lag, short pen-to-screen hovering distance,
<del>high initial activation force, no option to &nbsp;edit the pressure curve</del>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great option would be a<strong> 'Pro' keyboard dock</strong>, housing an additional battery, and extra ports, such as LAN, VGA, HDMI, additional USB ports, a full size SD slot, and possibly also a discrete video card (e.g. a high-end GeForce M or
 an nVidia Quadro), an optical drive (why not, if there's enough space, and the weight of the dock does not exceed, say, 2lbs). That kind of addition would actually turn the Surface tablet into a full laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand there's lots of&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>hings I like&nbsp;</strong>about the current Pro model, and I think those should be included on any future Surface model:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 'dockability' (YAY! I would never, ever buy a laptop/hybrid device without a docking option)</p>
<p>- fountain-pen-like active digitiser (the Onenote-dedicated button is just brilliant)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- high-quality, high-resolution Gorilla-Glass-coated IPS panel with wide viewing angles and good sunlight readability (though it could be semi-matte to further reduce reflections)</p>
<p>- low weight and a relatively small size</p>
<p>- the kickstand</p>
<p>- the power it offers (i7-4650u with Intel HD5000, 8GB DDR, 512GB SSD)</p>
<p>- the magnesium-alloy frame together with an exceptionally high quality finish</p>
<p>- long battery life (but any improvement will be much appreciated)</p>
<p>- keyboard's backlight and the variety of colours available</p>
<p>- the DisplayPort that allows a high-resolution output</p>
<p>- Windows 8.1 Pro of course :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I guess I'd be willing to pay a bit more for a 13-inch-ish Surface Pro than the current pricing of the Surface Pro 3, but TWICE as much sounds almost insane. I'd say the top limit would be around the
 price of a similarly spec'd Fujitsu T935 :)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Added: Sept. 24th 2014</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the more I think of it, it does seem an even better option for the future iterations of the Surface Pro to offer&nbsp;<strong>15 inch&nbsp;</strong>and even&nbsp;<strong>17 inch</strong>&nbsp;options in the&nbsp;<strong>3:2 ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just imagine,&nbsp;<strong>a 15" 3:2 screen (311x217mm)&nbsp;</strong>would actually allow you to&nbsp;<strong>view an A4 sheet of paper as it is (1:1)&nbsp;</strong>while still leaving some space at the top to display the menu bar - I'm thinking&nbsp;<strong>Adobe Acrobat/Reader
 'Read Mode'&nbsp;</strong>here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas an even larger&nbsp;<strong>17" 3:2 screen (359x240mm)</strong>&nbsp;would allow viewing&nbsp;<strong>a life-size Legal document&nbsp;</strong>(the fine print clearly visible :)) while at the same time making it possible to display&nbsp;<strong>a 1:1 A4 page in MS Word's
 Print Layout&nbsp;</strong>together with&nbsp;<strong>the rulers, the ribbon, the menu bar,&nbsp;</strong>and even<strong>&nbsp;the windows start bar</strong>! Wouldn't that be just fantastic?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have myself been dreaming of such a solution ever since I started using&nbsp;<strong>MS Word&nbsp;</strong>for preparing printouts about 20 years ago :) That kind of format would also work great for the&nbsp;<strong>Adobe CS</strong>&nbsp;line of products, such as the&nbsp;<strong>Illustrator</strong>.
 Also, I think being able to do some real&nbsp;<strong>A4-format-based work&nbsp;</strong>would be much appreciated by many&nbsp;<strong>digital artists</strong>&nbsp;out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just something I think Microsoft can build and successfully market to a whole bunch of professionals around the world. And I believe that now with the&nbsp;<strong>5th generation</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>Intel Core i
</strong>processors available, such devices can be made&nbsp;<strong>light, thin,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>power-efficient</strong>&nbsp;enough to justify their usability in a contemporary work environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Added May 9th, 2015</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of mid-2015, some other additions seem to be appropriate:</p>
<p>- a <strong>Skylake</strong> chip when they come out, up to a high-end i7, together with&nbsp;<strong>IrisPro
</strong>graphics</p>
<p>- at least <strong>16GB</strong>&nbsp;of <strong>DDR4</strong>&nbsp;<strong>RAM</strong>&nbsp;(DualChannel preferably)</p>
<p>- a <strong>WiGiG</strong> (802.11ad) radio, wireless docking</p>
<p>- a <strong>Razence wireless </strong>charging coil</p>
<p>- an <strong>Intel RealSense </strong>3D camera for Windows Hello</p>
<p>- An <strong>HDMI 2.0</strong> port with <strong>HDCP 2.2</strong> support</p>
<p>- <strong>Thunderbolt 3</strong>&nbsp;<strong>USB-C </strong>ports</p>
<p>-<strong> Windows 10</strong> obviously</p>
<p>I guess a <strong>4K </strong><strong>screen</strong> resolution, and a <strong>
1TB M.2&nbsp;</strong><strong>SSD</strong> option would also be a welcome addition, although I don't see those as particularly necessary.</p>

<p>Well, as of today, the Surface Book seems to be the answer to most of my requests. Truly a great product; I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a light &amp; powerful, high quality penabled device. No complaints on my part,&nbsp;except for&nbsp;some minor
 software bugs.</p>

            I would get either... so long as it was still light weight. &nbsp;Surface pro 3 is just on the edge of being over the right weight. &nbsp;My issue is that for us older guys, its hard to read the screen in high-res mode. &nbsp;I would love to keep the resolution the same,
 but just have a larger screen with the lightweight feel. &nbsp;And yes, they would need to make windows better than its current Jekyll and Hyde version of 8.1..

            I think 15 inches will be a sweet spot. I just hope that they make the keyboard typing area bigger too... not just the border of the keyboard.

            <p>I really want a 14 inch tablet to replace my XPS 15. In my experience 15 inches is just a little too big to be practical (unless you're completely tethered to your desk) but at the same time I think 13 inches is just a little too cramped for design work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I would want it to have a 4K display (I think that's perfectly reasonable for a big tablet) and a fanless Intel Core M processor with 8gb RAM. I say this because 80% of the time that's all the power I need. It would be nice if it came with a type
 cover, but what would be really cool is if you could also purchase a keyboard dock that&nbsp;<em>included</em> a GeForce gtx 850m and an additional 8gb RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the average person could spend $1000 for the tablet part with type cover included and people like me could splash out an extra $1000 on the keyboard dock. Is that really unreasonable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most important thing however is&nbsp;<strong>weight.</strong> The new 15" HP envy x2 seemed pretty cool to me until I realised it was over 4lbs! I think 2lbs would be acceptable for a technology this new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts people? What kind of device would you like to see?</p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.

            As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

            If you want to downgrade...
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

    <title>Duplicate Microsoft account created during Windows 8 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcmike64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Microsoft account created during Windows 8 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I may have a "duplicate" or "shadow" Microsoft Account (not sure what to call it) that was created during my WIndows 8 Upgrade to my laptop<em>.</em> For background, before the upgrade, I had an @live account
<em>only</em> (no @hotmail).</p>
<p>Near the end of the upgrade, I was asked to create a Microsoft account or, if I already had one, to just sign in with my credentials. So, I signed in with my @live credentials. A message was returned stating in effect "We are having difficulty connecting
 to the Internet at the moment. Not to worry, an account will be created for you now. You can change this later if you like".
</p>
<p>it was at that moment, this "shadow" account must have been created. Immediately after the upgrade, if I went into my Calendar tile on Windows 8, all calendar events were listed twice. It showed a "Hotmail" event AND a "Live" event (for the very same item).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since formatted my hard drive and reinstalled Windows 7 (due to various issues with Windows 8). So, Im now using the outlook.com Calendar (instead of the Windows 8 live tile for Calendar) and I dont see duplicate events in the outllok.com calendar.
 However, the duplicate account issue&nbsp;still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently purchased&nbsp;a Windows 8 phone (after this dupicate account issue had been created). Here's how I know these two "accounts" still exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If I go to my People Hub and try to edit a contact there, it&nbsp;lists two options, "edit Hotmail" and "edit Live".
</li><li>If I add an Agenda or To-Do item to the Calendar, TWO events are listed for the same thing. A "Hotmail calendar event" and a "Live calendar event"</li></ul>
<p>How can I get resolve the "duplicate" versions of my Microsoft Account.?</p>

            <p>I'm adding more info to my original post. Upon further review...it appears this is what's happening. The Windows 8 Upgrade created a Microsoft Account that it titled "Hotmail" and used my @live email address for the email address&nbsp;tied to the&nbsp;account. Then,
 later, my "outlook.com" account (which was using my @live email address), was <em>
linked</em> to my Microsoft Account (don't know if I did this or if it was something Windows 8 automatically did?). That account is now titled "Live" - but is using the same email @live&nbsp;address as my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...if I unlink the "Live" account, that would eliminate the duplicate entries in the Calendar and People Hub contact info. But...I don't want to do that because then my outlook.com ("Live") account will not sync info to my Windows 8 Phone (emails, calendar,
 People contacts, etc) and vice-versa. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what? Is there a way to "reset" my Microsoft Account so that my outlook.com account IS the Microsoft Account? Then, I would not have to have a linkage between the two because they would be one and the same.</p>

Jared, I am signed in but do not see your private message. The link you reference only contains a private message from a previous moderator. Also, I do not see a Private Messages "Tab" anywhere (only an icon that has roll-over text of "this post has private
 messages) - but that icon is not clickable.

                    I downloaded Free movies HD app from Windows store. The app works but I cannot play any movie or tv series, there is a black screen and that's it. What problems could be with the app or even with my PC?

            <p>Hello Liezl Fal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I can not open any movies on apps like Free Movies HD, Free Instant movies and so on. There are many servers to click to watch movies and tv series but nothing is working. It's only the dark sceen. Maybe it's because of the slow Internet or something?
 But i think that it works great because before some days those apps worked.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, slow Internet could also be one of the reasons why you are unable to play any movies. Another thing could be the firewall on your computer. Try disabling it temporarily and see how it goes. By the way, were you referring to this:

                    <p>I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 10. Afterward, had some problems and need to reinstall it, so I created an installation flash drive (per the instructions from Microsoft). Now, however, before I can use it, I need a Product Key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find this? Do I have to BUY a new Product Key?</p>

            <p>Hi there , was having same problem , but upon further research found I was doing it improperly ,you need to go to Microsoft downloads and find&nbsp;installation media tool , copy to usb zip drive and run it rather than windows 10 install.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

            You don't need a product key. You made an upgrade to Windows 10 from older system, so activation server remembered your laptop. Now, you can make a clean install from flash drive and your Win10 will activate automatically.

    <title>How do we get microsoft to quit destroying computers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisgordon3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do we get microsoft to quit destroying computers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I started using computers in the days of DOS. Computers where stable then. I would by a new computer every few years as technology advanced. It has been years since I have bought a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I do not buy computers is because Microsoft destroys them. After a few months, windows updates and nothing works, The operating system becomes unstable. I go to do something that should take a few minutes and end up spending days, even months
 attempting to get the computer working again. I would like the computer to be a reliable tool that works for me. Bill Gates vision of PC 's in every home was a great visions. Computers where very help through Windows NT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Microsoft windows has made using PC's so challenging that you have to be a computer programmer to keep them working. Even programmers I work with agree. They have the same issue, Microsoft updates and they have to work on the operating system to get
 it stable. unfortunately, I do not have the same skills as my coworkers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice for PC users. Computers are a very useful and product tool when they work. I would not mind buying new hardware if the investment was worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>If you don't like Windows these days, give Linux a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I haven't had any significant issues with Windows 10 since they added an approximation of the Start Screen back in. But I do take the precaution of making an image of my hard drive before the latest feature update because there's always a chance
 of something going wrong, and always has been. I find Windows is more reliable now than ever - I had to reinstall Windows 98 every couple months because the registry would get corrupted. XP was a dog until SP1 was released. And Vista, while it had some great
 ideas, was hobbled by being released on PCs that were just far too underpowered for it. But all the versions since have been rock-solid for me.

</p><p>When I create an outbound rule allowing Program: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe Service: All &nbsp; Any/Any/All windows update works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable the above rule and use the 2 following rules it does not work:</p>
<p>Program: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; Service: BITS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any/Any/All</p>
<p>Program: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; Service: wuauserv&nbsp;&nbsp; Any/Any/All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking for hours and I am unable to find a document or post that says what other specific services of svchost are required for windows update to work.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>SvcHost</strong></em> is a system process that hosts multiple Windows services in the Windows NT family of operating system. It is also essential in the implementation of so-called shared services processes, where in the services can share a
 process in order to reduce resource consumption. In line with your concern, I'd recommend enabling
<em><strong>Windows Update services</strong></em> via <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> (<strong><em>Admin</em></strong>) using the commands below. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <em><strong>Search</strong></em> box, type cmd, right-click the result and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>.</li><li>Once <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> starts, copy and paste the following commands and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong> after each line in order to run it:
<p><br />
<em><strong>SC config wuauserv start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config bits start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config cryptsvc start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config trustedinstaller start= auto </strong></em><br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>Once done, restart your device to apply the changes and try to install the <em>
<strong>Windows Update</strong></em> again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for an update with the outcome and let us know if you need more help.</p>

<p>Zedrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the great reply, but unfortunately it is still not working. I feel like I am a bit closer though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set all 4 services to autostart, just in case. I created 4 windows defender firewall rules for application svchost.exe and services
<em><strong>wuauserv, bits, cryptsvc, </strong>and </em><em><strong>trustedinstaller
</strong></em>allowed any/any/any/any. I can see 2 outbound connections blocked to Microsoft address space on tcp:443. The error I am getting from windows update is 0x80070426, which just seems to indicate a connectivity error. I wish the defender logging was
 a bit better :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be another service for svchost that is required for Windows Update. If I create a generic rule allowing svchost.exe with all services, update works as expected. It is only when I try to limit it that it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again.</p>

<p>From a few searches:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some information on the Black Viper site that may help, but it'll need some sifting through I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/windows-services/windows-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/windows-services/windows-update/</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>And also this article which shows how to reset the update components and mentions four services in the script code -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset-windows-update-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset-windows-update-windows-10-a.html&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>:&nbsp;
 bits, wuauserv, appidsvc, and cryptsvc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure if that helps or not really? :-)</p>

<p>George, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't even thought of checking BlackViper. I feel like that got me closer, but still no joy. I cannot even fathom that this is not documented somewhere and easily accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have <strong>wuauserv, usosvc, trustedinstaller, rpcss, rpceptmapper, eventlog, dcomlaunch, cryptsvc, bits</strong> all allowed thought the defender firewall and still no go. It may be time to write a script that creates an allow rule for each service
 with svchost then disable them 1 by 1 until update breaks. I was really trying to avoid doing this though.</p>
<p>

<h2>            A most excellent OS Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Well done Microsoft!</p>
<p>Despite anything I would have said in the past, this is a quality product that get's better and better!</p>
<p>The work by the entire Team shows. </p>
<p>I think of the times when I first entered the computer job market and DOS 2.0 was the Flagship desktop product.</p>
<p>I built my first 8088 on a&nbsp;on a generic motherboard with just released RGB and&nbsp;a 10 Gigabyte hard&nbsp;drive (compressed&nbsp;to 20 Gigabyte).</p>
<p>LAN networking was still in the 3COM stage (try building one of those servers!).</p>
<p>When the FUNLOVE virus was the first real computer virus threat.</p>
<p>It's all of you at Microsoft and users around the world that made things&nbsp;where they are today.</p>
<p>Because when it's all said and done it's the personal efforts that brought us to this end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for allowing me to be a small part of this project!</p>
<p>I will continue to help if needed. All my systems are stable and reliable.</p>

<p><em>Maybe you should switch to Apple.</em> </p>
<p>Or we could had been strong armed by having to buy Windows 10 without the ability to work with&nbsp; it before the purchase. to help Microsoft to improve the product. And pay another $139 for an unfinished product as we have in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Forced updates</strong>, We have been getting auto dates since XP or WIN2000.</p>
<p>Windows 10 gives&nbsp;us the ability to setup a simple limited home or small office network.</p>

            <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I am extremely upset to see the apps are not launching, Cortana is not working, I can't search for anything, can't get on the internet although there is a connection because the app isn't working, the Taskbar and navigation
 properties are nowhere to be found, my Norton Antivirus app has been pushed somewhere to where I can't find it although it's still installed, and I must say I was happy for the first hour that it WAS working properly. Even doing a system restore to a earlier
 time does not help. You guys should have waited until Christmas if you're having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only remedy for this I came across after hours of messing with it is to go to the Update and Security section located in Settings. You have 3 choices. Reset the PC, Go back to 8.1, or start up from a disc. I will also check on my Norton Anti-Virus to
 see if I needed to update it and I'll get back to this site with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I discovered I had to reinstall my antivirus which I did. I chose to Reset the PC keeping my files and after the PC reset itself it never turned back on. Thanks Microsoft! Your garbage OS just f-ed up my PC!</p>

            <p>Update (A few hours later): Nice to see I'm not getting feedback from Microsoft. Well anyway if you've read what I'm going through this is part two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do a manual reset of the CMOS and BIOS in the motherboard and thank God it's turning on. Now I will do a clean install because I think there are some drivers that are not functioning because the Windows 10 upgrade did not upgrade the drivers that
 were already in the computer. So I recommend whoever is upgrading do a clean Windows 10 installation instead. No upgrade from Windows 8 or 8.1. And one more thing. Download Windows 10 to a DVD and keep it safe in case something happens. You can always repair
 directly from the Windows 10 DVD. Not like me. Now I am re-downloading the Windows 10 but this time it's going on a blank DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hello again everyone! I modified my problem solving a bit by doing the same thing I did before (see above) but this time I did something different. After getting my laptop to the way I wanted it I went into System Restore and made my own restore point after
 erasing prior restore points. I know there is no going back further now but I am content with that.</p>

            <p>I have 4 PCs on W10 now. Two were upgraded from W8.1 then later clean installed, and two were brand new clean installs. One of the originally upgraded machines started having this problem after about two days and it still persists. Yesterday, one of the
 brand new machines developed this problem after working flawlessly for about two weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've only found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3f9311/windows_10_apps_crash_at_start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> thread at reddit that references this problem <em>and</em> offers a solution that worked for at least one person. I plan to attempt this after work today and will report back if it works or not. If anyone else is free to try sooner... Please do :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I am now home tried the above link and it did not work for me. Back to the drawing board...Just as the 3rd PC in my home (3/4 now) is exhibiting this problem as of today.</p>

            <p>Hello again everyone! After what I did which is explained above I have had no problems. If none of what I explained in this page helps you I recommend Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery where you can reset your PC. It takes about an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does come with it's own calculator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend activating Cortana so you can talk to your laptop and get what you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the games it could be that the games are not compatible with Windows 10. I know that&nbsp;a majority of the programs that worked with Windows 8/8.1 will work with Windows 10. One program that did not work for me is CG+G to AVI for karaoke files so I had
 to look for one that did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this page is for Windows 7 users but it could work for Windows 10. Try "To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter" on this page:</p>
<span>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never used Power Shell Command. Mabey you have to be signed in to Microsoft to use it? I really don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the kicker: For some reason computer cleaners like Frontline Registry Cleaner which worked very good in prior Windows operating systems are the cause of the apps not responding. I recommend just using the Disk Cleanup app (which has been part of
 Windows for years) to clean your computer. I have mine saved to the Start panel for frequent use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps everyone.</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>My Acer laptop worked fine since I installed it - until today! No apps would launch, nothing worked but everything seemed to be there. I used my other machine to look up faults. What I read looked a bit complicated so being a simple guy I decided to do the
 easy thing first. I remove the mains lead and with a pin pressed the reset button underneath. That's the same as disconnecting the battery on a lot of laptops.</p>
<p>Perfect - it worked and the laptop is now back to how it was. </p>
<p>Moral....... do the easy things first and don't look for trouble that may not be there.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Por exemplo No Batman Arkhan city você joga com o Batman, se você tiver o código do complemento do Robin você pode jogar com o Robin, se comprar o complemento da Catwoman vc joga com ela, etc...Mas você pode TERMINAR o jogo sem complemento nenhum? Claro
 que pode. Então os complementos ajudam ou aumentam a duração ou o tamanho ou colocam mais fases no jogo? Exatamente isso que eles fazem.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with CCleaner for the removal of unnecessary junk and temp files, Temporary Internet Files, and all the others it can remove; as well as the Startup section for taming what starts at boot time, although I perfer Autoruns for Windows from
 Windows Sysinternals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do not agree with using any registry cleaner of any type, free or commercial. Windows 7 simply does not need it nor do you, the user, need the extreme risk they present to your system. My thoughts only but here's a few others as well:</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. My old laptop connects perfectly to my network, and I can't get my new one to do it. Both operate with WIN 10. Only difference is the old one is an hp and the new one is an acer. None of these articles are helping. Again, one laptop
 is on network and the other isn't.</p>

<h2>            window 10 keyboard malfunction</h2>
                    <p>The laptop worked completely fine after upgrading to windows 10 for a month but now the keyboard is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>at the sign in screen the keyboard doesn't work only the number &nbsp;above the letters work. the numpad doesn't work .After signing in all the keys work except the letter ' e '.</p>
<p>i tried all options like disabling &nbsp;sticky&amp; filter &nbsp;keys ,system restore ,etc.</p>
<p>i also tried safe mod but the problems shows in safe mode too. i also performed a clean boot but no use.</p>
<p>a few days ago i was having the same problem but it was solved until today it came back but this time it was different, every time i pressed 'e' it typed 'e' and '9' also. then again &nbsp;stopped working</p>
<p>the other problem is during sign in, if i don't enter my pin for few minutes the screen freezes and works after pressing random keys.</p>
<p>also the numlock doesnt work .</p>

<h2>            Region problem</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Macau S.A.R, but there was not Macau S.A.R in the region list at that time so i selected Hong Kong S.A.R for my region when i registered in 2009.</p>
<p>Recently, i found that &nbsp;Macau SAR&nbsp;is a option in the account migration&nbsp;so i changed my region from Hong Kong S.A.R to Macau S.A.R. After that, i found that
<span>&nbsp;on my dashboard it says '' Xbox Live is not available on consoles in your region.'' &nbsp;I cannot edit my avatar,change themes or download items.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;on my dashboard it says '' Xbox Live is not available on consoles in your region.'' &nbsp;I cannot edit my avatar,change themes or download items.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;I didn't know that xbox live is not&nbsp;available in Macau S.A.R before changing my account region. Now i can't download DR2 and DR2:CZ.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
The account migration will let you migrate to any region as there are a lot more Microsoft services that are in many different countries. You'd need to do some checking to find out if your country/region is a LIVE enabled region by looking at the list of countries
<strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, now that you've changed your region to an unsupported LIVE region you'd need to wait 3 months before you're able to change regions back. There's unfortunately no way to speed this process up.&nbsp;</p>
