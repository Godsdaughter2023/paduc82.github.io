<h2>            Why can&#39;t we get the Freelancer source code&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I understand that this is probably the wrong way to go about it but seeing as I know of no other way, then this seems the best option currently.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Freelancer is a game from 2003 that has enjoyed the merits of a Microsoft hosted 'global server' for many years. That support was removed over a year ago, though it may have been longer. Since then it's actually been the players, or the developer
 community rather, that has instead created a way to not need that global server, while still maintaining the same functionality in the game.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Currently there is a strong developer community involved in the game, even with it's declining player-base. However whilst a lot can be done as it is, many modifications to the game require such things as modifying the game's main .exe file, which
 is against the terms and conditions and so possibly illegal. However Microsoft hasn't taken any action against such a thing. The only actual trouble the Freelancer community has encountered in it's modification history has been a debacle involving a Halo themed
 modification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So whilst Microsoft has essentially removed most of it's support for the game, it also hasn't done anything to halt it's modification, something which many are thankful for.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ultimately however, there are many parts of the game that most wish could be changed, but never can be due to the 'hard-coded' nature of such a thing, where the key to changing it is locked away somewhere that we either lack the knowledge, or the
 ability, to get at.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There have been many requests for the Source Code of Freelancer but none have come to fruition. I understand this is due to a policy that Microsoft has that it does not give out the source code of it's games or that the questions should be directed
 to the developer instead perhaps. The latter is impossible as the developer was bought by Microsoft and subsequently dissolved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ultimately the question I want to ask is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the reasons for not releasing the source code of Freelancer when it has happened for so many other games, such as Freespace 2?</strong></p>

<p>Linkus, your name looks familiar from Discovery Gaming Community (http://www.discoverygc.com)</p>
<p>...I must comment on your Concluding statement above...:</p>
<p>"<span><strong>Ultimately the question I want to
 ask is:</strong></span></p>
<span>
<p><strong>What are the reasons for not releasing the source code of Freelancer
 when it has happened for so many other games, such as Freespace 2?"</strong></p>
<p><span>This is incorrect, because Freespace 2 has *nothing* to do with Microsoft, it was developed by Volition, Inc. and Published by Interplay.</span></p>
<p><span>These Companies are not divisions of Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>A Better closing statement would have been asking about their releasing the Source Code(s) of the Mech Commander, MechWarrior and Mech Assault franchises.</span></p>
<p><span>The Battletech Franchise was a significantly larger Intellectual Property; and yet they released their grasp upon it.</span></p>
<p><span>(Although FASA / Weisman have reformed as Smith and Tinker, teaming with Piranha to make a full reboot of the MechWarrior Series, apparently the first due this year.)</span></p>
<p><span>That would actually carry weight in an argument as to why they will not release a much smaller Intellectual Property to the modding community.</span></p>

            Hi Kathleen,
<br />
<br />Did you enter the same user account in this game as you use for Windows?
<br />This type of issue can be caused by logging into a different user account, a local account. But if you have logged into the same user account as you use for Windows, the problem can be caused by the corruption in the user profile.
<br />In any case, try running the App troubleshooter.
<br />Tap on Start, type in Troubleshoot.
<br />Tap on Windows Store apps - Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Andrew N.

<p>
</p><p>My skype on my mobile has not worked for yonks, but as you have decided I no longer need my RTX phones I needed to get my android mobile to work. It does not. In fact when I try to download skype I get that it is "not for your device!" I have tried skype
 internet, and put in my skype name and password and it starts "signing in" with the blue ball rotating, then the screen goes blank . The header is there, with a small blue S in a box, then the padlock, then the https with skype for web and then it just sits
 there. For information I am using French Orange, using OpenDNS a Belkin Modem etc. There is no difference between wifi or connected. The system partially works on the windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Rogerinfrance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you have faced. I'd be glad to assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, what is the OS version of your mobile device? Make sure that your device meet the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
specific system requirements </a>to run Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Skype for Web, this will not work on your mobile. To use Skype for Web, all you need to get started is a supported web browser and an internet connection (on Windows: Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 10 and above and latest versions of Chrome
 and Firefox. On Mac OS: Safari 6 and above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about Skype for Web, <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34515/finding-your-way-around-skype-for-web-and-outlook-com?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Also, please clarify what do you mean by Skype for Web partially works on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hardware troubleshooting did not fix anything.</p>
<p>I already deleted the driver and installed the latest as stated in my first post.</p>
<p>I can delete the mouse from bluetooth, then pair again and the mouse works fine.</p>
<p>The bluetooth panel says "connected".</p>
<p>Then when nthe mouse is turned off, the bluetooth panel says "paired"</p>
<p>The next time I turn on the mouse the bluetooth panel flashes 'paired" then "connected" then "paired" etc.</p>
<p>The mouse does not work.</p>
<p>I can again delete the mouse and pair again and it works until the next time the mouse is turned off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The mouse driver and the bluetooth driver ARE up to date and HAVE been deleted and reinstalled.</p>

    <title>Window.old folder on brand-new Windows 10 computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samantha_881  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window.old folder on brand-new Windows 10 computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've discovered a folder called Windows.old is taking up 16 GB on my brand new Windows 10 computer from the Microstore Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that this folder is only supposed to be there if you've upgraded from a previous version of windows, but I'm supposed to have a new hard drive with a new version of Windows, aren't I?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 256 SSD and would like to delete this file if possible, but first I want to know why it's there on a new computer. Is this a cause for concern (e.g. did I get a cannibalized part?!) Sorry if this is a dumb question.</p>
<p>

            <p>If it has a Windows.old folder I'd say the computer had been upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 before you bought it. &nbsp;If you want to free up space and clean up your computer including the Windows.old folder I suggest you use the program from the link
 below. It's free and I've been using it for years without any problems. After you have installed it and before you use it select "Advance user" and it will take you thru steps so you can delete and cleanup what you want. The Windows.old folder will still be
 there but only about 100kb in size</p>

            Thanks. This is a new model of computer, so I find it weird that it has had an older OS on it at some point. You'd think they would have cleaned it up a bit more too if selling it new. There are some driver glitches which I guess are left over from the
 "upgrade." I'm not thrilled, especially it's supposedly Signature Edition and therefore optimized, blah blah.

            <p>Not necessarily. I just noticed that my PC has a Windows.Old folder as of 2 days ago. This was when a massive Windows 10 update came through (I love how they tell you there are cool new features but then don't show you any of them haha!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC was installed with Windows 10 Enterprise from scratch so I know it's a new folder. The date of the folders also give it away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate the phrase "Your files are right were &nbsp;you left them"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why.. what the heck did you do Microsoft... :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use disk cleanup (Clean system files) to get rid of it nicely.<br />

            I did the PrivaZer program and just watched it in horror as it wiped out my Microsoft office 365 icons off my cortana page and this is a new HP laptop win10 . &nbsp;Now I have so many corrupt files and registry I had to go to Microsoft webpage and pay a substantial
 sum to get my new laptop back into working mode. I'm unable to uninstall the the office programs and reinstall them and it never did wipe out the Windows.old program at all. I know you say the old folder will still be there but , its fully still there. &nbsp;Warning
 people I wouldn't run the program on a new computer. Get professional help or just leave it there unless you absolutely have to get rid of it. &nbsp;I'm so disappointed. &nbsp;I would not run this program on a new laptop . &nbsp;

</p><p>The <strong>Xbox One X</strong> and the <strong>Xbox One S </strong>are <strong>
multi-voltage</strong>. This means that the internal power supply will work practically anywhere around the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will work on 110V supplies and 220/240V supplies, it <strong>does not </strong>
require the use of a transformer.</p>

</p><p>Did you check to see if that folder actually exists on your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Burn\Burn</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could have been a temporary folder that existed when you created your backup set and has since been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that folder/path no longer exists you will need to refresh your backup set or make a new backup set that doesn't include that folder/path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those kinds of error message that end in 0002, 0003, 0005 are telling you something and once you know what they mean it is easier to figure out the problem.</p>

    <title>Windows XP sp 0 to sp 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farmerrls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP sp 0 to sp 1</h2>
                    Dell is refusing to honor a warranty that was sent to me in Feb when I purchased and registered&nbsp; a 3721 brand new inspirion on ebay. Dell claims fraud was involved and they can refuse any support. My display is broke. Last conversation I had with a Dell
 fin svcs manager " I suggest you consult your lawyer, that's what you get from not purchasing from Dell". A billion $ company putting the screws to a lowly enduser whose only mistake was buying a Dell product on ebay. Speaks well for Dell.
<br />
&nbsp; I was stuck with a Dell 4400 desktop running Windows 2000 pro and ie6. Try to do anythinmg with that combination. I partioned the hard drive and was able to install XP sp0 . Can boot, get email and limited internet access. However when I try to update the
 base XP nothing works, sp1, sp1a, or sp2 which is the level almost any product requires. I have sp3 on a cd I used to upgrade my old compaq presario. It fails in this envireoment. Somewhere I saw an article about an exe file that can offline get me to sp2.
 Any help?.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

            <p>I can help you get to SP3, after that you are still likley to have problems with Windows Updates&nbsp;which are well documented on this web site if you search for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you must download SP2 from... </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>...and then run the downloaded program to install SP2. You can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you have done that you can install SP3, but before you do, read this article…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Install SP3 by downloading and running from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>…again, you can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC. Ignore any recommendation from Microsoft to use Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After that you may well encounter further problems including but not limited to...</span></p>
<span>
<ul>
<li>Windows Update error 0x8024D00</li><li>Performance issues with Windows Update (high cpu usage and hours if not days to check for updates)</li></ul>
<p>If you cannot find the answers on this forum, the best bet is to ask separate questions about each phase that you encounter a problem with.</p>

<h2>            Stop Chromium from autostarting</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Chromium Autostart</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with a software package called 'Chromium'.</p>
<p>The package auto-starts the internet browser on login and I don't know how to turn it off!</p>
<p>I have a limit on my Internet allowance and this is wasting what little I have!</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the situation,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I am using the current updated version of&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WINDOWS 10 (ten)</span></em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-A software package called 'Chromium' starts automatically&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">every time</span>&nbsp;I log onto my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I have tried starting in safe mode and tried all the other suggestions given to me by Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Uninstalling attempts have had no effect at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-All the links referred to in the solutions offered refer to Windows 7 (seven) software so doesn't appear to apply or help in &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;any way at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Chromium Is Still Starting Automatically!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Adding another user was suggested but that seems pointless when everything I need to use is on the ADMIN desktop.&nbsp;<br />
How do I deal with this problem?</p>
<p>I am seriously looking at resorting to selling the laptop and buying an Apple Mac-Book! They seem to be a lot less trouble compared to Microsoft?</p>

<p>Type <strong>msconfig</strong> and press enter.</p>

<p>Is there is a more straight forward way of fixing this ongoing problem?</p>

<p>Hi Betsy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about the third-party antivirus software can be due to its structure and/or conflicts with the operating system. To isolate software related conflicts,
<span>we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.
 Once you're in the clean boot environment, perform a full scan using the specified application. The link will also provide steps on how to isolate the cause and how to revert your device back to normal boot after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Features, functionalities, and performance management of the specified program are best discussed and facilitated by its developer. We'd also recommend engaging the support team of the antivirus software should the issue persists when using the clean
 boot environment. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>
<p>

<p>My issue is slightly different, I downloaded the game and have redownloaded it several times and I can load the game up to the point where you select "new game" from the main menu then I go into an indefinite loading screen
</p>
<p>I think it's a simular problem to what happened with bully scholarship edition where it was an error with the sorce download file.

            Hello. you can add it as an exception to the list of folders controlled.
<br />1. Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />2. Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />3. Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />4. From there, you can add an app to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked

            Hi AmanShukla2
<br />
<br />XtuService.exe is a safe process it is the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility Background Service
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager, find that process, then right click and choose Open File Location
<br />
<br />Note down the location of that executable
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />From there, you can add the executable to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent it from being blocked
