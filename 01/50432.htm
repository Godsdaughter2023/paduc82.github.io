<p>Thank you for the information. Since it is a custom-built PC, can you perform hardware diagnostics? If yes, please do so to check for any hardware failures. If not, you can ask help from a local technician near your place. Also, since you can't enter safe
 mode, you might have to consider formatting your computer to resolve the issue. </p>

            <p>That depends if the fan is actually not working once the system is running, I suspect it is, as if it wasnt the built in bios overheat protection would cut in and shut down the PC.</p>
<p>There was a problem with some motherboards/bios where on booting the fan bios detection event was triggered prior to the system fully loading and the fan subsequently being detected as haveing power.</p>
<p>You might want to try HP support, or their forums to see if this problem effects your specifuc system</p>

Open the PC look inside and locate the fan that is not spinning&nbsp; and buy a new fan.
<br />
If the fans are all spinning it may be the speed is too slow on the one in question.<br />

Did some research
 and discovered that the 802.11g/n wireless driver is missing in the network adaptor under device manager. I&nbsp;suspect this as the cause of non-connectivity but how can I download and install this wireless driver to the PC??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please provide me simple steps to follow in installing this 802.11g wireless driver?</p>

As near as I can determine, your Optiplex was made in Australia.&nbsp; If you are indeed in Australia (and you probably are, if you have a Telstra modem/router), I don't have any information about what products might be available to you or where you could purchase
 them.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My personal preference would be an adapter that includes a cable so that the antenna isn't positioned between the back of your computer and the wall.&nbsp; On the other hand, if your computer is going to be withing a few meters of your router, it doesn't make much
 difference, and you could use an adapter that looks like a USB flash drive (or smaller).&nbsp; My guess is that any of the products on this page would work for you --&gt;

<h2>            Windows 10 Unknown Administrator</h2>

<p>1. I guess it's a Microsoft Account. I don't believe that I have ever had any others. (I'm a black box-level user.)
</p>
<p>2. I had two accounts on Windows 7. My user account, which I suppose was&nbsp;vwdennis&nbsp;for which I was chief cook and bottle washer, and a second for Western Digital backed up files retrieved from an external hard drive. The adm account is now titled VWD-DESKTOP\WD
 TRANSFERS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. "An error occurred while attempting to set password for this user account."</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer not working, can&#39;t delete files, favourites or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr daddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer not working, can&#39;t delete files, favourites or empty recycle bin.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell Vostro 1510 laptop, Vista Home Premium (32 bit) Service Pack 2. I have PC Tools Firewall Plus installed and Eset NOD32 anti-virus 4. I always keep my laptop up-to-date and regularly run anti-virus scans and Malwarebytes scans (the latest of
 which didn't find anything). <br />
<br />
I am unable to delete any files from my laptop as Windows Explorer keeps&nbsp;hanging every time I try.&nbsp; The only way&nbsp;to get&nbsp;rid of it is to start Task Manager and stop the process.&nbsp;I also can't delete any of my favourites from Internet Explorer or move things to
 the recycle bin from the desktop, or empty the recycle bin. I am unable to delete files from my MP3 player when that is plugged in.</p>
<p>After being advised on another forum, I ran Combofix but it didn't find anything.&nbsp; I was also advised to run Hijackthis, but it will only run in safe mode (I can post the log here if required).&nbsp; I tried system restore and was also told to try running the
 windows disk error checker.&nbsp; The problem still persists.</p>
<p>I have tried running windows in safe mode and I am able to delete files then.&nbsp; Please could someone suggest how I can fix this problem?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>Try temporarily disabling your anti-virus software and test if the problem persists or not.</span></p>
<p><span>In most cases, an anti-virus program will not allow itself to be disabled in a clean boot therefore it still runs, but since the problem doesn’t persist in safe mode, where its disabled, it could be the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>Some anti-virus’ will still interfere even if turned off. If you have the media and all required material to reinstall the anti-virus and are in a secure environment, you can try uninstalling it temporarily as
 well to make sure that it isn’t interfering.</span></p>

            Hi, thanks for your question! Hopefully I can help.
<br />
<br />I've done a thorough search and the only results I could find for Microsoft Mahjong daily challenge solutions is probably the same Youtube video you've watched. Here it is, just in case it's different:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L07VEqZT1CI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L07VEqZT1CI</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/L07VEqZT1CI?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/L07VEqZT1CI?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Microsoft don't publish solutions to their Mahjong puzzles. Could you make use of the hints function to help you solve it?
<br />
<br />Sorry I couldn't be more helpful! I hope you're able to solve the puzzle eventually. Thanks!

<p>Same as others here, my Xbox Live works fine for about 30 mins and then disconnects me.&nbsp; It occurs most often when playing Black Ops.&nbsp; This is simply unacceptable behavior from a PAY service (Xbox Gold account).&nbsp; Microsoft, please fix the issue or provide
 real support instead of forcing users to dig into help articles that won't help them.&nbsp; All of my other internet-facing devices are working just fine.&nbsp; Xbox is the only device that is constantly failing.&nbsp; And no, my modem doesn't need to be recycled or ports
 opened.</p>

<p>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" and click on "More info", what is the exact message shown on screen?</p>
<p>There is no option for "more info" test goes fine. &nbsp;The probem is random and appears after 1-30 minutes. Usually the connection works longer just after I start the xbox. The longer I play the shorter are connection times. &nbsp;The xbox is more or less in open
 air so if it is cooling problem its internal to xbox not because of the ambient temperature.</p>
<p>As stated above our two computers are connected to the same router and network connection losses are very rare.</p>
<p>Network speed is about 14 Mbit/s (dowload) and &lt;1 Mbit/s (upload).</p>

<p>Before I point to an account issue, I'd like you to try logging in on a console on a completely different network. It is highly unlikely your account is to blame here, but I like to be thorough.

    <title>Canon Pixma MX892 all in one Scan Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjholding  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon Pixma MX892 all in one Scan Error</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Canon Pixma mx892 all in one printer to replace a 4 year old HP all in one.&nbsp; On both printers when I try to scan a document of any kind and save it as a file, I get an error message and cannot accomplish this task.&nbsp; I can however,
 print normally on paper - documents, photos, internet site info, etc and had some success with scanning a document and faxing it in the fax programs of these two printers.&nbsp; Also I can readily copy a paper document on the scanner and print it out on paper.&nbsp;
 Using the &nbsp;Canon keeps giving me the error "Canon MP Navigator EX has stopped working - A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available".&nbsp; My computer is a ZT bought from Costco,
 2 years old with plenty of HD &amp; memory with an Intel CPU running Windows 7 - 64.&nbsp; Canon shows their software is compatible and I have downloaded updates and installed 3 times now after removing the Canon software and still get the same results.&nbsp; I also have
 kept up with Microsoft updates and turned off the fire wall during installations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Several things I have come upon is when I run some diagnostic programs like recently Windows Error and Repair, the software identifies the computer architecture as AMD 64.&nbsp; Is the computer architecture different than the type of CPU?&nbsp; ALso, I don't ever
 recall having this problem before with Win 7 - 32.&nbsp; Is anyone else seeing this and any ideas or solutions out there? &nbsp;The HP was doing about the same thing only it would get into the scan program and actually start the scan and very shortly into it, it would
 lock up and eventually an error message would appear after a long wait that the process had failed.</p>

            Thanks for your quick response.
<div><br />
<div>My computer is a ZT model # MS-7636&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>We have 2 Users; myself and my wife configured on our system</div>
<div><br />
<div>The version of Windows is Win 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1 and version 6.1&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the Event Viewer, I am not familiar with using that part of Windows. &nbsp;I did look at it though and did not see anything that looked associated with a print error. &nbsp;Let me know if I could send a copy to someone to look at.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since my original email, I did find an update on the Windows update site and downloaded it. &nbsp;For a short time it seemed to let me scan and create a file, but in the middle of the process, it locked up giving me the same symptoms and error message as before.
 &nbsp;I am now wondering if I should start all over and unistall the printer again and see what happens. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>R Holding</div>

            I have tried all of the above and still not working! &nbsp;At this point I am considering reinstalling Windows and starting over. &nbsp; I hope it doesn't come to that! &nbsp;I thought it was fixed with the update for this model of printer from Microsoft Updates, but
 it only worked so far and then froze up. &nbsp;After that happened it started back doing the same thing. &nbsp;That is, immediately after selecting any scan function, popping up the error message that the "Canon MP Navigator EX has stopped Working" without ever even
 showing the scanner menu. &nbsp;Could someone guide me in the use of analyzing the Event Viewer?

<h2>            Windows update repeatedly failing. How to proceed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 has been trying to install an update for a few days it seems. I keep getting an error that it could not complete. This occurs after a reboot, and each attempt to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last time it went a bit further along I think, because I no longer have an option to Update in my start menu/power settings. How should I proceed?</p>

<p>KB4034658 indicates you are on version 1607. The latest stable version of W10 is 1703 and the computer might be failing to install it.&nbsp;KB4034658 &nbsp;also has removed update history which had an evidence if the PC was failing to install the feature upgrade aka
 1703.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, try updating manually to 1703 and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Use Media creation tool or the upgrade assistant to upgrade your system to the creators update.</p>

<p>I have run the update manually, and this is what I see. Am I current now?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23352d31-e26d-4ad1-b118-56bc9838926d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23352d31-e26d-4ad1-b118-56bc9838926d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not appear to be current - It keeps offering my updates when I go to restart. I choose to update, and I receive no failed notice, but no new updates get installed as best as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            <p>You dont mention what programs?</p>
<p>Whether you visited those program makers sites to see if there are any upgrades.</p>
<p>Generally a program designed for winxp will install on a win7 PC, there are exceptions but you dont provide sufficient info to offer advise</p>
<p>What *exact* version of win7?</p>
<p>As for 'info' if you refer to data files theres no reason why they cannot be transefered to a win7 PC</p>
<p>Note data files burnt to a cd are generally read only</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for reply,im not a pc guru, just knwo the basics, my trade is auto technician and have bought various data material from ebay to use for my training, i had a disc which was called TIS2000 which was a VAUX disc that worked well on XP, then that
 pc died, and had to buy new, reloaded the TIS2000 disc and it would run, the disc was disposed of, like a fool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i had call to use the disc again, managed to locate the same disc, these are very rare with valuable info, i purchased it, and the sales add did state - NOT COMPATIBLE with windows 7, so the plan is to keep an eye out for a cheapy pc on xp to load all
 my cd data discs onto and keep purely for info source, unless i can get it to work on windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The material is on a DVD disc with the material date 2009 printed on disc, my pc is a medion machine, 4 months old , 32 bit sp1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another disc that is vaux based and when i load the disc and manually select uto play, it starts then stops and says STOP all running TIS2000 programmes, but i dont know how to fully search for such programmes, i clicked on my start button and search
 for TIS files which returned back a 0 result - no files, so i not sure how to search for a file to stop it when i cant find it and believe it not to be present on my pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers for your reply, andy</p>

            <p>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
<br />
Use the following steps:<br />
1)&nbsp;Right click on the Program<br />
2)&nbsp;Click on Properties<br />
3)&nbsp;Click on Compatibility tab <br />
4)&nbsp;Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</p>
<p><br />
Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></p>
<p><br />
If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software
 in Windows XP.</p>
<p><br />
If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, you cannot run Windows XP mode but you can try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) or any other 3rd party virtualization
 software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose. You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
Hope one of these options will work for you. </p>

            <p>Hi Marilyn, thank you for your views, i did have to use the compatibility tab to load up my VW auto infomation, so will have to dig my notes out for that 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1st problem i have overcome is the screen shot my pc throws up when i load the cd and run: stop all TIS 200 programmes before continuing.</p>
<p>As i dont know what these programmes are, i can only search files named as TIS2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spose then, this is the correct time to format my pc wipe clean and load up the supplied disc and see whats happens....... 2xdiscs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>disc 1:application &amp; support disc</p>
<p>disc 2:medion recovery disc</p>
<p>the s/w included on this rec.disc was preinstalled on your h'drive and may only be used for back up.</p>
<p>32 bit operating system, windows 7 home premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i am running home premium, so im guessing i can wiipe my hard drive clean, simply pop the cd in and follow instructions ?</p>

    <title>100 Tips For Minecraft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildattorney  say:</h3>
<h2>            100 Tips For Minecraft</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>The following are 100 quick tips for Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp; You can stack fences, but only if you do so from top to bottom</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp; You can create a pool of unlimited water by digging a 2 x 2 square 1 block deep and placing water on two opposite corners</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp; If you press the right analog stick and enter crouch mode, you cannot fall off of a block (very useful for extending a bridge, etc)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp; Mining obsidian that sits atop an active lava flow can be frustrating if the obsidian drops into the lava below immediately upon being mined.&nbsp; This problem can be solved by placing 1 block
 of water over the obsidian you are mining.&nbsp; When the obsidian is mined, the water will turn the lava below into obsidian before the block you mined drops into the lava. You can then mine the new obsidian below as well.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp; While you can eliminate water in a cave by placing a block over the source of the water, you can accomplish the same thing by collecting the source water in a single bucket.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp; Signs, ladders and sugar cane will hold back water, allowing you to create an airlock for easy access to and from water.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp; If you are under water and place a torch, the torch will extinguish, but there will be a momentary air bubble created which can keep you alive underwater forever (as you get your torch
 back when it goes out).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>8.&nbsp; If you place a door underwater, it will create a permanent air bubble for as long as the door is there.&nbsp; The door need not be connected to any structure.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>9.&nbsp; If you place a torch underneath a block supporting a column of sand or gravel and then mine the supporting block, when the sand and gravel fall on the torch, they will immediately be turned
 into resource blocks that you can pick up by walking over them (no need to physically mine the sand or gravel).&nbsp; In lieu of a torch, you can also use a slab, which has the same effect.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>10.&nbsp; Assuming you are level, you only need one powered rail for each 30 or so unpowered rails to maintain a fairly steady speed when traveling by minecart.&nbsp; Minecarts don’t go anywhere near
 as far when they are unoccupied, so be sure to run your tests on an occupied minecart (unless you intend to use unoccupied minecarts in your rail network for some reason).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>11.&nbsp; You can quickly build a very tall tower by pressing A to jump immediately followed by pressing the left trigger to place a block beneath you.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>12.&nbsp; After you create the tower referenced in tip #11 above, you can turn that tower into a lava tower simply by pouring a bucket of lava on the top of the tower (you will want to jump off
 quick).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>13.&nbsp; MOBs cannot spawn on glass or single slabs (although they can spawn on double slabs, which the game effectively considers a normal block).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>14.&nbsp; Many of the seeds used in the PC version will work on the Xbox 360 version.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>15.&nbsp; For each block you travel in the Nether, you are traveling 3 blocks in the Overworld (much less than in the PC version).&nbsp; This is useful for fast travel between two Nether Portals in the
 Overworld (the world you normally play in).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>16.&nbsp; The world is limited in size to 1024 x 1024 blocks.&nbsp; While you can mine the last block at the edge of the world, you cannot place a block in that last block space.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>17.&nbsp; You can find diamonds on layers 1-15 above bedrock, but the largest distribution of diamond can be found between layers 5 and 12 (the percentages of diamond in these 8 layers are roughly
 equal, with a very minor drop in diamonds at layer 9).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>18.&nbsp; Mushrooms are most commonly found in caves and in the Nether.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>19.&nbsp; Soul sand, found exclusively in the Nether, is best used in creating docks (by slowing boats).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>20.&nbsp; Netherrack, found exclusively in the Nether, will burn forever once lit on fire. This can be used in lieu of torches.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>21.&nbsp; If you set a pig on fire, he will drop cooked pork.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>22.&nbsp; When playing online, you can join the maps of “friends of friends,” when means that people who are strangers to you can join your map.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>23.&nbsp; To avoid griefing (others joining your map and destroying your creations), it is recommended that you save the map when they join.&nbsp; If you do so, and someone destroys your creation or
 steals your loot, you can recover by simply exiting without saving.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>24.&nbsp; Squid will spawn not only in oceans, but lakes and even waterfalls.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>25.&nbsp; Land animals will spawn on your property if it has grass.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>26.&nbsp; If a block is next to a cactus, it will not grow beyond one block tall and will drop to the ground its extra growth.&nbsp; This is useful in creating automated cactus farms.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>27.&nbsp; If you place bonemeal on a recently planted plant (sugar cane, tree, cactus, etc), it will instantly grow to maturity (provided it is located in an environment where it has physical room
 to grow).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>28.&nbsp; You can get rid of liquids (water or lava) easily by placing a block over it.&nbsp; When you re-mine that block, the liquid will be gone.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>29.&nbsp; A better way to get rid of liquids is to place torches over it.&nbsp; It works exactly the same way as other blocks, but you don’t have to waste your pickaxe mining the blocks.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>30.&nbsp; Try to avoid digging directly above or below you, as you may fall into lava or cause lava to fall on you.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>31.&nbsp; When you hit a creeper, he will back up slightly and move to his right.&nbsp; If you also back up and move to your right, you can keep a distance from him before he explodes.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>32.&nbsp; If dealing with mobs is a hassle, switch to Peaceful mode, where there are no hostile mobs.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>33.&nbsp; It is not guaranteed that all seeds will have all resources.&nbsp; For instance, the tutorial world does not have sugarcane.&nbsp; Some seeds don’t have pumpkins.&nbsp; Other seeds don’t have cactus.&nbsp;
 That said, there are many seeds that do have all resources.&nbsp; If playing a new seed, you may want to check on the resources before you invest yourself too heavily in that game.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>34.&nbsp; If you are digging and you hear multiple mobs, chances are you are close to a cave.&nbsp; If you hear the same noises on Peaceful mode, look around you in real life to assure there is not a
 zombie apocalypse going on.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>35.&nbsp; Glowstone and pumpkin torches will work underwater.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>36.&nbsp; Sugarcane must be planted next to water for it to grow.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>37.&nbsp; Cactus and trees do not need to be planted near water in order to grow.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>38.&nbsp; Cactus will destroy blocks you throw at them, which means they can be used as a garbage can.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>39.&nbsp; Placing cactus around the perimeter of your property will provide you some level of defense.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>40.&nbsp; With a little work, you can turn the dispenser into an automated fire arrow cannon.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>41.&nbsp; Redstone wiring only extends for so long before it no longer carries a signal.&nbsp; You can resolve this issue by placement of a repeater to extend the signal.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>42.&nbsp; Certain items can only be crafted in a furnace, such as stone, glass, green dye, charcoal, etc.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>43.&nbsp; Gold tools should be avoided.&nbsp; They have high speed, but very low durability.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>44.&nbsp; Build your mine access inside your house so it is easy to get to and you don’t have to risk mobs.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>45.&nbsp; mobs will spawn inside your house if it is not well lit.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>46.&nbsp; If you attack a Pigman in the Nether, all of his friends will quickly gang up on you.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>47.&nbsp; When chopping trees, start with the block second from the bottom.&nbsp; That way you can stand on that bottom block to reach the higher tree blocks.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>48.&nbsp; Your respawn point will be wherever you last slept in a bed.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>49.&nbsp; A quick way to start an underwater base is to dive underwater and dig three blocks down, and then place a block above you.&nbsp; There will now be air in &nbsp;your two block space and you can build
 out your underwater base from there.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>50.&nbsp; When you mine, a good strategy is to mine two blocks high (so that you can fit through the tunnel).&nbsp; When you reach the end of your tunnel, move three blocks over and start your parallel
 tunnel at that point, such that there are two blocks between your new tunnel and your old tunnel.&nbsp; If there are any resources in the two rows you have not mined, you will see them in one or the other tunnels.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>51.&nbsp; A boat will automatically go to the top of any body of water.&nbsp; This means that if you take a boat to a waterfall, it will quickly elevate itself to the top of the waterfall.&nbsp; This can
 make for a quick elevator to the top of structures.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>52.&nbsp; You can use water to flush away all grass and quickly harvest wheat.&nbsp; Just pour a bucket.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>53.&nbsp; You can use buckets of water to vertically climb areas that you normally would not otherwise be able to climb without mining.&nbsp; Simply pour water above you, enter the ensuing waterfall
 and press A to climb.&nbsp; Repeat as necessary to get to the top.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>54.&nbsp; You can use pools of water to jump off high structures.&nbsp; This is particularly useful when making lava towers or other tall structures quickly.&nbsp; Simply build a pool of water at the base
 of the structure.&nbsp; The water will need to be one block deep for each 19 blocks of altitude you are jumping from to avoid damage.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>55.&nbsp; You can avoid damage to your mining pick by quickly switching between picks while mining ore.&nbsp; Only the pick that is being used when the block collapses is assigned durability damage.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>56.&nbsp; You can build canals with flowing water contained by signs, pressure plates, or other blocks and travel on those canals by boat much faster than you could walk.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>57.&nbsp; You can use a bucket of lava as a fuel in the furnace.&nbsp; A bucket of lava lasts a long time, typically as long as it takes to cook three to four stacks.&nbsp; However, you lose the bucket.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>58.&nbsp; If you position a minecart at the bottom of falling lava, you can pass through the lava fall by entering and exiting the minecart, which will teleport you to the other side of the lava.&nbsp;
 This is particularly useful to create a hidden doorway to a secret room where you may store your valuables.&nbsp; If you build it correctly, the minecart will not be visible and most people will not think to get too close to falling lava.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>59.&nbsp; When mining or going through caves, it is a good idea to have a bucket of water with you.&nbsp; If you come in contact with lava, you can quickly use the bucket to extinguish the flames and
 hopefully survive the encounter (just pour it at your feet).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>60.&nbsp; TNT, bookshelves, wool, fences, wood, planks, and wooden stairs are flammable.&nbsp; If you build these next to an open lava source, they may catch on fire, causing a lot of headache.&nbsp; Of note,
 though—lava will not ignite anything below it—just above it and to the sides.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>61.&nbsp; The embers and fireballs that come out of lava are purely decorative.&nbsp; They will not be the cause of any fires.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>62.&nbsp; If lava flows horizontally into water, cobblestone is created.&nbsp; But if water flows horizontally into lava, nothing happens.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>63.&nbsp; If vertically falling water touches still lava on any side obsidian is created, even if the water would not run into the lava’s square.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>64.&nbsp; Lava which is flowing will destroy the following in its path: wheat, flowers, mushrooms, levers, both types of torches, redstone wire, and rails. Lava doesn't flow over pressure plates,
 fences, or even wood or wool blocks.&nbsp; Sugar cane holds back lava, but will disappear if the sugar cane’s water source is destroyed by the lava.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>65.&nbsp; Using a redstone wire, a one-block lava flow can be redirected by supplying power to the spring block, which will cause it to reset the flow towards the now-nearest terrain depression.
 It cannot, however, be reversed.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>66.&nbsp; Lava can be easily duplicated in the following manner.&nbsp; A 2x1 depression is mined out of dirt, and a bucket of lava is poured against the back “wall” of the depression.&nbsp; Once the lava
 begins to glow, it can be scooped back into the bucket.&nbsp; After a few frames, the lava will reappear in the depression while also being in the bucket.&nbsp; Both are source blocks that can be placed and collected. &nbsp;While occasionally this method just destroys the
 source block, the majority of times it duplicates it.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>67.&nbsp; Minecarts will favor South or East motion at a four way intersection because they favor “starting” at the North or West edge.&nbsp; This helps you predict minecart travel and plan your minecart
 network effectively.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>68.&nbsp; Be careful when exiting a minecart.&nbsp; If there is only one block of headroom above you, you will take damage exiting the minecart.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>69.&nbsp; A minecart can actually jump from a higher rail in elevation to a lower rail.&nbsp; However, the rider will take damage when it lands on the new rail line.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>70.&nbsp; If you place water in the corners of a doorway, you can make a water door, which looks cool and has some effect on keeping out mobs (although if they see you, they will follow you through
 a water door).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>71.&nbsp; Pigs can be ridden while in Minecarts, although a saddle is needed. This gives you a self-propelling minecart.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>72.&nbsp; You can’t place most blocks atop a chest and still be able to access it.&nbsp; However, you can place stairs on top of a chest and still access it.&nbsp; The back of the stone stairs looks identical
 to cobblestone.&nbsp; By placing stairs on top of chests, you can stack chests flush against a wall.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>73.&nbsp; Always place your door while standing outside of your house.&nbsp; That way the mobs cant get onto your doorstep.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>74.&nbsp; The easiest way to make a water elevator is, at the top of your tower, make a C formation of blocks extending out the side of the tower (the gap created by the C formation should be one
 block in size).&nbsp; Then simply pour water in that gap.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>75.&nbsp; You can attach signs to each other whether or not there is a wall or ground present.&nbsp; However, every sign connected in this way will be destroyed if you destroy the original sign.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>76.&nbsp; You can get four dyed wool for the price of one by dying the sheep before you shear/knock the wool off.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>77.&nbsp; You can navigate a cave without getting lost by placing torches on only one side.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>78.&nbsp; You can walk 50% faster over shallow water (one block deep) by looking down and continuously clicking on the ground below you while holding a bucket.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>79.&nbsp; If you want to fireproof your wooden structures, build them out of stacked wooden slabs instead of wood.&nbsp; Unlike wood, stacked wooden slabs are fireproof.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>80.&nbsp; If you need to get underneath a bridge or other block that extends out, you can use water as a scaffold.&nbsp; Simply pour a bucket out the side and jump in the water. &nbsp;You will be able to
 navigate below the block and return to the top of the block.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>81.&nbsp; You can use paintings to conceal a passageway by placing the painting over the passageway.&nbsp; You will be able to pass through the painting, but other people won’t know the passage way is
 even there.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>82.&nbsp; Water and lava behave differently.&nbsp; If you destroy the source block of water, all of the water is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you destroy the source block of lava, much of the lava remains.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>83.&nbsp; When exploring caves, always be sure to have torches.&nbsp; They are essential.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>84.&nbsp; Wooden chests and crafting tables will not burn even though they may appear to catch fire.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>85.&nbsp; In peaceful mode, fire hurts you at the same rate you gain health, so fire alone can't kill you.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>86.&nbsp; Fire can be used to kill mobs without them becoming hostile to you</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>87.&nbsp; Punching or hitting the side of a burning block will extinguish the fire block “attached” on that side. Hitting fire with a tool does not use up any uses for the tool. &nbsp;Placing water,
 sand or gravel will also extinguish fire.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>88.&nbsp; In this version of minecraft, there are only two kinds of music discs in the world--CAT and 13 (more will be added in the updates).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>89.&nbsp; While gems and iron are more likely to be found in caves because of more surface area, they are also more likely to be split by the caves, yielding less ore.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>90.&nbsp; In some vein formations, ores connect diagonally. It is therefore wise to mine around the ore to see if more can be found.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>91.&nbsp; The underside of the crafting table has the same texture as wooden planks, which means that they can be secretly placed in ceilings of wooden houses.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>92.&nbsp; You can put a pumpkin over your head by placing the pumpkin in the inventory box where you would normally place your helmet. &nbsp;Fun in multiplayer, but it somewhat restricts your visibility.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>93.&nbsp; Slabs are non-solid to redstone. &nbsp; As a result, you can hide redstone wiring in a slab covered channel while still being able to connect to the wire on the sides of the slab.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>94.&nbsp; You can fish in any body of water (even man-made).&nbsp; If the water has open air above it, the chance to catch a raw fish is 1/300 every tick (1/20 of a second). &nbsp;If you fish inside, the
 chance to catch a raw fish is 1/500. &nbsp;On average, you can catch a raw fish every 15 seconds when fishing outside, and one every 25 seconds while inside.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>95.&nbsp; Coal can be found at most elevations, but appears together in much greater quantities below sea level.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>96.&nbsp; It is much more efficient to turn wood into charcoal and then use the charcoal for smelting than it is to smelt entirely with wood.&nbsp; Two saplings can be burned to produce one charcoal,
 avoiding the need to use any wood for smelting.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>97.&nbsp; Like pork, raw fish can be placed in a furnace to produce cooked fish, which provides more health when eaten.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>98.&nbsp; For the most productive fishing, cast into the water with a large wall at your back - when fish are reeled in, they can fly out of the water and over your head, possibly going back into
 the water, especially if you are fishing from a boat.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>99.&nbsp; Slime balls exist in this version of the game, but there is no use for them until the Xbox 360 version gets updated to the equivalent of Beta version 1.73 of the PC version, which will
 be occurring in the near future.&nbsp; So you probably want to hang on to them for now.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>100.&nbsp; Try not to spend all your time playing Minecraft. Enjoy life!</span></span></p>

<p>I have to question 33. In another post I mentioned using the tutorial level to clown around and basically do things I would never do in my regular world. During one such expedition as I was looking for the light house, I ran into a single block of sugarcane.
 I will double check to see and make sure I got that right, because honestly everywhere I go everyone says its not there, but I'm pretty certain that's exactly where I saw it.</p>
<p>I'll try checking youtube for any videos of it also should there be any.</p>

<p>If there is sugar cane on the tutorial world, I stand corrected (although I believe my point remains that not all maps have all resources, so its good to scout around before you get too invested). &nbsp;I wonder what you mean by "a single block of sugar cane,"
 though, as sugar cane comes in three blocks &nbsp;when fully grown and sugar cane always grows naturally in small groups (at least in my experience). &nbsp;I don't understand how you could find only one block.</p>

    <title>How to disable autoconnecting to bluetooth speaker&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulk_f  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable autoconnecting to bluetooth speaker&#63;</h2>
                    When I'm turning bluetooth ON, my pc immediatly connects to my bluetooth speaker. Even if I manually disconnected speaker during pc using and then power off it, after turning pc ON bluetooth speaker reconnect again. Seems like Windows not saving latest
 state of manually disconnected/connected bluetooth devices and once you disable bluetooth and enable it again, windows wants connet to all devices that it paired...<br />
I want to connect to my speaker only manually or force windows to saving latest connected status state

</blockquote>
<p>The worstest advice ever. It's looks like don't use this and have no problem. May be you should leave this community and turn off your computer?</p>
<p>Suppose that I want to use bluetooth headphones, I'm turning bluetooth on... and windows connecting to speaker instead of headphones, than I need disconnet speaker, connect headphones.
</p>
<p>I think we can help Windows to be more smart. The question is how?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Error code 0x8100002F and or error code 0x80070002 when you back up files in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/979281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/979281</a><br />
<br />
Ensure the drive is fully accessible by copying files to and from it manually.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
See if this applies.</p>
<p>You encounter problems when you move data over USB from a Windows 7 or Windows Server<br />
2008 R2-based computer that has an NVIDIA USB EHCI chipset and at least 4GB of RAM<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976972</span></a></p>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>If possible make a Restore Point before doing this. If not, then&nbsp;for each key on LEFT in RegEdit<br />
highlight it and then click FILE above and EXPORT the key before changing it. If you make a<br />
mistake find the Key you changed and Right Click on it and MERGE and you will be right back<br />
where you were. (These keys are not critical so you can do that, in other circumstances a<br />
change to the Registry in other areas is not so easy to reverse.)<br />

How to Create a System Restore Point in Windows 7<br />

How to Do a System Restore in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html</span></a><br />
<br />
This problem is usually due to one or more profiles under :<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList with missing ProfileImagePath.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To check whether you have missing profiles:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open regedit, navigate to the above registry key. <br />
<br />
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList). <br />
<br />
Expand the list<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on each of the profiles listed. The first 3 profiles should have ProfileImagePath value of<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SystemProfile,<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService, and<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService<br />
<br />
respectively.<br />
<br />
3. Starting from the 4th profile, the ProfileImagePath should contain path to the user profiles<br />
on your machine, such as C:\users\ShouldBe<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;If one or more of the profile has no profile image, then you have missing profiles.<br />
<br />
To work around this, delete the profile in question (Caution: The registry contains critical settings<br />
that are necessary for your system to function properly. Take extra caution while making changes)<br />
<br />
1. First, export the ProfileList key for safekeeping. (Right click on the key, choose “Export”, and<br />
save it to the desktop.)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Right click on the profile in question, choose delete.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Try backup again.<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Sometimes creating a new ADMIN profile will solve the issue (after trying the above).<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
</strong>If needed (and only after trying all the above since if any of those exist this will not work) try a<br />
Repair Installation which allows you to keep the existing programs and data though redundant<br />
backups are always a good idea.<br />

How to Do a Repair Install to Fix Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html</span></a><br />
<br />
==================================<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
There have been confirmed reports that this occurs only when folders or libraries are selected and<br />
not during a full backup - can you confirm this if the above does not help? What happens if you<br />
try a full backup?<br />
<br />
Do you have an ADMINISTRATOR administrator account, meaning you renamed the ADMINISTRATOR<br />
to the USER NAME you use? Control Panel - Users - what are the ACCOUNT NAMES there? This seems<br />
common to the last few that have had this issue.</p>
<p>What antivirus/antispyware/security programs have EVER been on the computer, used or not, on the<br />
computer but not used, and those uninstalled?<br />
<br />
Have you added a 3rd party backup program lately?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>I found OE elsewhere after it retired and was able to use it with my TimeWarner/Spectrum account.&nbsp; I moved last summer and Spectrum cable was not available...so had to use DirectTV.&nbsp; I contacted the author of OE and we worked together to find a way I could
 use OE.&nbsp; Actually we had to link through gmail.&nbsp; So, my address is a gmail address which I can access through my Outlook Express and continue to create and send messages with photos inserted to a group of friends like always.&nbsp; https://runasxp.com/index.php</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, after the recent Windows update, the MSOE.DLL keeps me from accessing my OE.&nbsp; I have a lot of 'stuff' in there that I need.&nbsp; I do have the store folder on an external drive, but that doesn't help me with this problem.&nbsp; I'm afraid to reinstall
 OE from the creator's web site because I don't want to try to figure out how to link it again with gmail.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing whether that would happen.</p>

I turned 83 last Saturday.&nbsp; Hopefully, I can keep OE for the rest of my life.&nbsp; It's so much more useable than anything else I explored.&nbsp; I've been creating "Sunday's Chuckles" and "Wednesday's Smiles" for 19 years...plus "Friday's Funnies" since 2006.&nbsp; Also,
 Golf Chuckles, once a month.&nbsp; I have a lot of readers who have been on my group mailing list for a long time....and they renew every year.&nbsp; It's a cheap hobby.&nbsp; I have images and 'favorite photos' that I insert into these mailings.&nbsp; I can't find any other

<p>11 years ago, when OE was retired, you were just 72, comparatively young and mentally agile, 2 years younger than I am now. If you cannot find a way to run OE on your current machine then this might be the end of the road. Good luck!</p>

<p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I have no physical issues. Play golf regularly with younger men who could be sons. Can't hit the ball as far as they do, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally took a chance and did a new install of OE from <a href="http://www.runasxp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.runasxp.com</a>&nbsp; Actually,&nbsp; I had a link to it in my computer and a 'key' to download it.&nbsp; It opened and ran perfectly with no losses.&nbsp; I keep my 'store folder' on an external drive.&nbsp; My OE is synced with gMail and I was afraid I would have to go through
 that process again, but did not.</p>

<h2>            CPU usage problem</h2>
                    So after enabling all my cores then figuring out that not much had changed, i decided to go back to one core. When my PC restarted, everything got so slow. I managed to open task manager after like 3 minutes and saw that my CPU usage was at 100% but under,
 all of the processes said 0%. Something also worth mentioning is that I overclocked my i5 6600k to 4.3ghz but shows up as 3.5ghz in task manager. The overclock worked fine before this happened.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Keith,<br />
<br />
While device resets can be caused by a varying number of factors, we are aware of issues with some Advanced Host Controller Interface PCI-Express(AHCI PCIe) models that causes these symptoms in Windows 10 when running with the inbox StorAHCI.sys driver. Due
 to a firmware bug, the Solid-state drive (SSD) does not properly complete input/output when Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode is enabled. As a result, the Windows storage stack attempts to reset the device after waiting on unresponsive reads or writes
 for a period of time.<br />
<br />
Task Manager might show 100% disk utilization on Windows 10 devices with Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode enabled; Task Manager might show the disk to be at 100% utilization despite a light or no workload, and the system may experience lag or become unresponsive.
 In addition, the system event log contains numerous events with Event ID 129, which represent resets of the disk controller.<br />
<br />
MSI mode can be disabled for specific devices via the registry:<br />
<br />
1. <strong>Identify if you are running the inbox AHCI driver (StorAHCI.sys)</strong><strong>:</strong><br />
<br />
1.1 <strong>Open</strong> a <strong>command prompt</strong> with <strong>administrator privileges</strong>. Then type the following command in the command prompt window and hit Enter:
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong><br />
1.2 Under <strong>IDE ATA/ATAPI</strong><strong>Controllers</strong> right-click on the AHCI controller node and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. This node is usually called “Standard SATA AHCI Controller.”<br />
1.3 Navigate to the driver tab and click <strong>Driver Details</strong>.<br />
1.4 If you see “<strong>StorAHCI.sys</strong>” in the list, <strong>you are running the inbox driver</strong>.<br />
<br />
2.<strong> Disable MSI for the controller in the registry:</strong><br />
2.1 In the same properties window opened in step 1.2, navigate to the <strong>Details</strong> tab and select
<strong>Device instance path</strong> from the Property drop-down menu. <em>Note this path</em>.<br />
2.2 Open the registry editor by typing <strong>regedit</strong> in the previously opened command prompt.<br />
2.3 Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\ &lt;AHCI Controller&gt;\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties, where &lt;AHCI Controller&gt; refers to the device instance path you noted in step 2.1.
<br />
2.4 Change the value of the <strong>MSISupported</strong> key from “1” to “0”.<br />
2.5 If you don’t know which controller your boot device is attached to, repeat steps 2.1 through 2.4 for all AHCI controllers found under 1.2.<br />
<br />
3. <strong>Reboot the machine.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Update us with the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: security </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 620 hp laptop with a TPM 2.0 , my HDD is divided in 3 parts, the bitlocker is working a D &amp; E drives but when i try to</p>
<p>enable it on the C drive, a dialog box pops up saying " a TPM is not detected on your laptop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this possible ( i mean: can a bitlocker work on 2 partitions of the same HDD without TPM and not on the 3rd? if there's no TPM on my laptop )</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the TPM is not detected by Windows, verify that your computer hardware contains a compatible TPM and BIOS. Ensure that no BIOS settings have been used to hide the TPM from the operating system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are attempting to initialize the TPM as part of the BitLocker setup, check which TPM driver is installed on the computer. We recommend always using one of the TPM drivers provided by Microsoft with BitLocker. If a non-Microsoft TPM driver
 is installed, it may prevent the default TPM driver from loading and cause BitLocker to report that a TPM is not present on the computer. If you have a non-Microsoft driver installed, remove it and then try to initialize the TPM again. The following table
 lists the three standard TPM drivers that are provided by Microsoft.</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hello, </span></p>
<p><span>Can you confirm that you have notifications enabled for your email accounts in the Mail app.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From Mail go to Settings -&gt; Notifications.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the account that you would like notifications enabled on under the heading “Select an account”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure that “show notifications in the action center” is turned on.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check the options you would like to enable:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Show a notification banner, Play a sound, and Show notifications for folders pinned to Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Note that for the last option you will need to have the folder pinned to receive a notification for a specific<span>&nbsp;
</span>folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to check this for each account you want to receive notifications.</span></p>
<p><span>There are additional setting for notifications in Windows Settings, that may be preventing notifications.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open notification settings from the Start menu select Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Notification and actions.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Mail under the heading “Get notifications from these senders.”</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure that Notifications is on, as well as any other options that you would like to enable.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note that you can also change settings for pinned folders, however the folder needs to be pinned, the option needs to be enabled in the Mail app, and you have to have received at least one email
 for the pinned folder before it will be listed under “Get notifications from these senders.”</span></p>
