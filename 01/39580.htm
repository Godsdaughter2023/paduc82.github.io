<p>Fix it center cannot be run on all the problem,s listed. The word "Install" remains in front of the problem instead of the word "Run". Only a few of the problems show "run". That is why I am unable to run some of the problems. Please assist.</p>

    <title>Using Windows Anytime Upgrade Key to get Genuine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whitescar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows Anytime Upgrade Key to get Genuine </h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I got a message telling me that my copy of Windows 7 Home Premium is not genuine (should never have trusted my now ex-friend).&nbsp; I did the validation check and Microsoft's website says I can upgrade to a legal copy of Home Premium for $109.&nbsp; However, I was
 wondering if I can use a Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade to not only upgrade to Ultimate, but to make myself legal as well.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I get a boxed copy of a Windows 7 upgrade will get me genuine, will it just upgrade me to ultimate and still make me
 not genuine, or will it not work at all?&nbsp; Please let me know!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>The base license, in this case would need to be first validated before you can do an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate or else it would just report that its not genuine too and ask you to upgrade to a full version.</p>
<p>Get the Windows 7 Home Premium license validated. You can do this by telephone:</p>
<p><br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p>If its not a genuine license, you can purchase one at the Microsoft store for Windows 7 Home Premium and update the product key:</p>
<p>http://store.microsoft.com/microsoft/Windows-Windows-7/category/102</p>
<p>You haven't given us much details to work with though.</p>
<p>Is the Windows 7 Home Premium license installed now an upgrade or full version? Was it a friends borrowed license? If its a borrowed license, then you will need to purchase a full version key if you didn't have a previously installed/activated license (XP
 or Vista).</p>
<p>When you purchase the key, you can update the key:</p>

<p>Hi Mfrancis1961,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;When did the issue start?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you get any error message along with the black screen?</p>
<p><strong>A)&nbsp;You can check if the same happens in the safe mode and post back the results.<br />
</strong><br />
Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly.<br />
i. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
ii. Keep tapping the F8 key while the computer is restarting.<br />
iii. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER.<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.<br />
<br />
Check <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</a>&nbsp; “Start your computer in safe mode”.<br />
<br />
<strong>B) This issue might also be because the User Profile is corrupted, so create a new profile</strong> if the above step does not resolve.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety, and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Click Manage another account.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Click Create a new account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.<br />
<br />
Check the link “<strong>Create a user account</strong>” <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/68a1c4fd-b3f6-4cb9-93a1-8a6023836e531033.mspx#E1D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If the issue does not persist in new user account do the steps in the following link “<strong>Fix a corrupted user profile</strong>”

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error self-extractor header corrupt is caused due to corrupted self-extractors (and corrupted .zip files, as well) this has been introduced

<h2>            Cannot boot into Windows 7 after replacing power supply. Getting Error Code 0x490.________</h2>
                    When trying to boot into Windows 7, I receive the following error message;<br />
<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware of software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
<br />
1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings and then click "next."<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer."<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000e<br />
<br />
Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.<br />
<br />
When I try the repair option, I get the following error:<br />
<br />
Cause:&nbsp; Boot configuration is corrupt.<br />
Repair action: Partition table repair.<br />
Result: Failed. Error code 0x490.<br />
<br />
The only hardware change made was to change my power supply. The old one died and I replaced it. I have not been able to boot into Windows 7 since then.<br />
<br />
I have a dual boot with Windows XP, and have been able to boot into&nbsp; XP. However, I am unable to boot into Windows 7 at all. I have run Windows RE, and none of the options were successful, even though RE said they were successful.&nbsp; I suspect that RE is fixing
 the MBR on XP. instead of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Horribly slow wifi on Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to a speed test on my phone, my wifi is supposed to be 40.37 Mbps down, 38.85 Mbps up, and 40 ms ping, but since a week ago or two, my Surface has been hitting very slow speeds. Same speed test site is giving me .07 Mbps down, .26 Mbps up, and
 50 ms ping. I've come to the conclusion that there's something up with my Surface, but I have no idea what to do about it. I've updated, restarted, etc. Any ideas?</p>

<h3> mister echs  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;No driver found&#34; when connecting an USB gamepad controller in Win 7 64</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a newly-built PC running Windows 7 Home Premium and I am having an unusual problem.&nbsp; When I first connected my Razer Onza controller to the system, it was read and functioned fine.&nbsp; Then I installed the Windows Xbox 360 software for 64-bit systems.&nbsp;
 Suddenly my controller stopped working.&nbsp; I disconnected it and when I reconnected it, I keep getting the "No driver found" error.&nbsp; I decided to try with another gamepad, a Power A, and I am getting the same error.&nbsp; I am getting frustrated seeing as I have
 Windows look for updated drivers and am told none are available.&nbsp; I uninstalled the 360 software and still nothing.&nbsp; Any help on how to fix this?&nbsp; The only Microsoft 360 controllers I have are wireless, and I don't want to buy anymore since I have several.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would rolling back to an earlier update fix this?&nbsp; Unistalling all my USB drivers and let Windows start from scratch?&nbsp; Please, any reasonable suggestions would be good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Drop down menu stuck on screen - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henkkaart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop down menu stuck on screen - Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Recently few of my fellow co-workers experienced an annoying glitch in Windows 7: they were accessing drop down / context menus and when they selected something (let's say: right-click on desktop --&gt; Personalize, for instance) and the "Personalize" selection
 got "stuck" on screen in the exact same spot it had been clicked. Now, out of nowhere, my own PC (Windows 7) started having the same problem. All of our PCs, some at work and my own at home, are powerful machines with more than enough RAM (16GB, Intel Core
 i7-2600 CPU 3.40GHz) and good GPUs (mine is Geforce GTX 580 with 1536MB GDDR5, the others maybe a bit older but still good for today's gaming purposes).<br />
<br />
After searching information for a bit I realized that this is a more common problem than I first thought, some forum threads going as far as 2008 (Windows XP SP2 and SP3). Now, I also found some more or less working solutions, most being more or less temporary
 in nature. These include changing the screen resolution and then reverting back to the original, flipping the screen upside down and some a bit more advanced:<br />
"<span>Start - Run - "tskill dwm" or kill DWM.EXE from task manager, it will restart instantly with menu items gone." (as written on a forum thread)<br />
<br />
Now, some people find help in one or two of these solutions, some may not be so lucky. For me,
<a href="http://www.thedr1ver.com/2011/06/menu-selection-stays-on-screen-after.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TheDr1ver.com</a>'s thread gave the "answer". You go into Computer (right-click) --&gt; Properties --&gt; Advanced System Settings --&gt; Settings... (under Performance) --&gt;
</span>uncheck "Fade out menu items after clicking" --&gt; OK. What this does, I believe, is reduce the "eye-candy" on the transitions of elements on the screen or something like that. It helped my case but it also made the right-click drop down menus weird in
 a way that if I just right-click and don't move the mouse pointer, the menu will display as see-through and only after I nudge the mouse pointer, it will become fully visible. For the moment I am OK with this. Better this than having a "Properties" drop down
 item stuck on my screen.<br />
<br />
However, what puzzles me is that this problem has persisted for many years. And there have been a lot of threads concerning this. My question is: why hasn't Microsoft done anything to fix this? I can live without the eye-candy since on my OS I value performance
 over visual tricks but I should not have to change settings to a visually lesser "version" when my PC has the muscle to run it with all the eye-candy. Especially since it came out of the blue: the only thing I have changed over the past few weeks in my PC
 has been the new drivers for Geforce. And even after the installation of the new drivers there weren't any graphical glitches in Windows. This "drop down menu stuck" glitch happened without a warning of any kind. The same happened to my co-workers. Just one
 day you start your computer and this happens.<br />
<br />
I am going to state here that answers like "switch off Aero", "turn off all visual effects" are not applicable since they weren't an issue few days ago as they weren't an issue any day since I bought this computer. We (and I mean the multitude of people with
 this glitch annoying them to death) need a proper answer, a patch, something that will deal with the issue once and for all.<br />
<br />
My rig:<br />
Intel Core i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.4GHz<br />
Memory 16 GB RAM<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580 (1536 MB) GDDR5<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601)<br />
<br />
P.s. Sorry if my post sounds harsh towards the end but this problem has been so persistent for years that there needs to be an official solution that doesn't require powerhouse PCs to turn OS' visual features off just to get it run normally. Especially since
 the problem occurs randomly.<br />

<p>Does anyone having this problem have a different (not nvidia) video card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried reinstalling my drivers to see if it fixes anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: driver reinstall didn't fix problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix that worked for me: </p>
<p>Control Panel, System, Advanced System Settings.</p>
<p>Advanced tab, click Settings button under Performance section.</p>
<p>Uncheck <strong>Fade out menu items after clicking.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting the Desktop Window Manager Session Manager service will update the desktop to remove any existing ghosts too.</p>

    <title>Custom Gamer Pictures - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom Gamer Pictures</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I apologize if I am in the wrong area but this is my first time on the Xbox Forums. Tonight I tried to set an custom, and safe for work, image as my gamer picture. However, as I explored the sight I realized that there isn't an option to do this. I was surprised
 because services like Steam and Origin allow you to do this with relative ease however this option was not available. I know avatar's are important to Microsoft's wallet but this feature is easy to implement and doesn't distract from avatars. In my opinion,
 Custom Gamer Pictures can add further customization to gamer tags and produce a friendlier environment.</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft should allow users customize their gamer picture because it would prove just how diverse the Xbox Live community is. This community is international and has many people different kinds of people in it. By adding this feature it can
 give users the ability to express themselves in new ways. While I enjoy avatars, I feel they are rather limited in this regard. Avatars can only have a set amount of styles and facial features. Many avatars look the same or very similar.</p>
<p>To reiterate, allowing users to customize their profile pictures would be an easy feature to implement and it would be easy to moderate. I use Steam frequently and I have never seen a pornographic or disturbing avatar. Therefore, I would assume its relatively
 easy to moderate. If there is a valid reason as to why this feature can't be added then please inform me.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Firstly, welcome to the xbox forums going back to your description you can buy a camera and take pictures which is useful but I agree with what you say but I don't think this will be a feature to be added as gamer pics can be bought and Microsoft may loose
 lots of money if they did add this feature I think it should cost 60MS to upload that way they are making money.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. I hadn't considered the possibility of micro-transactions. Personally, I would be willing to pay for this feature and it would be a great way for them to get extra revenue.</p>

<p>May I just chip in my thoughts, there is one major issue I see with allowing you to upload your own gamerpic, what happens when some pervert decides its a good idea to take a photo of his/her bits and use that as a gamerpic? &nbsp;</p>
<p>As things stand now Microsoft have pretty much full control of these features although we do see people having their account banned for modding their avatar.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how much work would be needed to check every gamerpic uploaded?</p>
<p>I can't personally ever see the ability to upload your own gamerpic being implemented. Of course you never do know.</p>

<p>[/quote] Yes we know as I mentioned the camera in my posts but they are awful to get quality pictures and often images taken by camera will make it reflect another way e.g. try putting a word on paper and showing it in a mirror it goes all funny which is
 why the marketplace have had puma logos etc. -.-</p>

<h2>            How to download the regional &#40;e.g. ITALIAN&#41; version of the Windows 10 Enterprise installer from MSDN or somewhere else&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise my developer PC from a Windows 8.1 Enterprise ITA&nbsp;installation (that was already an update from a Windows 7 ITA).
</p>
<p>I am an MSDN user and I tried to find the ITA version of the installer of Windows 10 Enterprise in the MSDN repository, because I remembered that the update from 7 to 8 already asked the same regional version. However I found in the MSDN only the ENG and
 ENG - UK versions. So I tried the update using the ENG version of the Windows 10 Enterprise package, but I found the option to "<em>Keep personal files and app</em>" disabled because "<em>You can't keep Windows settings, personal files, and apps because you've
 chosen to install Windows 10 using a different language than you're currently using</em>".
</p>
<p>Note that the language of the user in Windows 8 was already set to English, but however the original Windows 7 installed in the PC was the Italian version of the S.O..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how I can avoid to loose all the programs installed possibly using the ITA version of the installer, because I cannot find in the MSDN repository any regional versions as I said (there are only &nbsp;only the ENG and ENG - UK versions).</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Deepak -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue. I have been trying to find a solution for this for quite some time, and have had no luck. The ATIV Book 8 has a dedicated AMD Radeon HD 8700M graphics card, but brightness issues have cropped up via the driver mentioned above that
 is related to the integrated Intel HD4000 graphics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get around the brightness problem by downgrading the Intel HD4000 driver to the generic Microsoft display driver; however, this results in the AMD Radeon HD 8700M drivers malfunctioning, resulting in getting no use from the dedicated graphics card
 (slow gameplay, horrendous rendering, etc.)</p>

</p><p>There are hundreds of hits on Google related to brightness issues for the Intel driver. I realize Microsoft isn't Intel, but this only arose in Windows 10, so I'm turning to you guys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Intel:&nbsp;10.18.10.4242</p>
<p>AMD:&nbsp;15.300.1025.1001</p>

            <p>Sorry to revive this, but I found a stable solution and would like to state it for the record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is a shared problem from both Microsoft and Samsung.</p>
<p>Samsung solved this issue long ago, but Microsoft keeps updating to a driver that will make this problem.</p>
<p>You need to first download a tool from Microsoft itself to stop updating a specific driver (Microsoft Update Hider), in this case to hide the Intel Graphics Driver update.</p>
<p>Once you do that, download (again) the Samsung update software and open it. It will give you the option to install all drivers but it will just make a folder with all these updates (this is what you need!). Once it downloads everything (make a folder called
 samsung in C: or at the desktop), you have to go to the device manager and uninstall both the AMD and Intel display drivers (the "AMD Radeon HD 8800M Series" and the "Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000"). Restart the computer.</p>
<p>Remember you won't have a Display driver, so any external monitor will be off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Samsung folder you created (the one with the drivers you downloaded with the Samsung update utility) and install First the Graphics Driver (Folder named "Graphics Driver_10.18.10.4242_64bit"), this will install both the AMD and the Intel Driver.
 Second, install the "Samsung Settings_2.0.0.106" (don't ask me why, a technician told me this, I was stubborn not to do it and it didn't work, second time I followed his advice and it worked). Third, install the "Brightness Control Patch_10.18.10.4242".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should work almost right away, if not, restart and check. I have done this 2 times and I can confirm it works (2 times because the first time Windows updated the driver and I lost everything, the problem came back)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SUMMARIZING:</p>
<p>1- Download and install the Samsung Update tool (from Samsung, name is "SWM_Setup.exe"), it will ask you to install drivers (you already have them installed) but instead it will download the files and ask you a location, make a "Samsung" folder at C: or
 at the Desktop</p>
<p>2- Download and install the Windows Update Hider (from Microsoft, name is "wushowhide.diagcab"), make and install it in a "Microsoft" folder</p>
<p>3- Run the Update Hider and choose to hide the Intel HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>4- Open the Device Manager and Uninstall the Intel HD Graphics 4000 and then the AMD Radeon HD 8800M&nbsp;</p>
<p>5- Restart</p>
<p>6- Go to your Samsung Folder and run the installer at the "Graphics Driver_10.18.10.4242_64bit" folder (it will install both the Intel HD Graphics 4000 and the AMD Radeon HD 8800M), wait a long time till it stops.</p>
<p>7- Go back one folder up and then go to the "Samsung Settings_2.0.0.106" folder and run the installer, wait a long time again till it stops.</p>
<p>8- Go back one folder up and then go to the "Brightness Control Patch_10.18.10.4242" and run the installer, wait a long time till it stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done. If you have problems or you loose again the brightness control, do all the above again, it is extremely important that you block any Graphics updates and only install the drivers from Samsung, not from Microsoft.</p>

            Your suggestions seemed promising, but did not work for me.&nbsp; My experience started deviating from yours when I ran wushowhide.diagcab and the Intel HD Graphics driver was not listed for me to hide.&nbsp; Following the rest of the directions thereafter did not
 bring back function to my FN keys.&nbsp; I still cannot adjust screen brightness with the FN keys and I have to put my lap top to sleep for adjustments in brightness using the system settings to take place.&nbsp; I no longer have a back-lit keypad.&nbsp; I am disappointed
 with the lack of Samsung and Windows compatibility.&nbsp; Upgrading (to Windows 10) should not mean downgrading my hardware and function, but it does help these F__kers sell more crap.

For the record, this works on other models too - I've got a Samsung Slate 7 series - so if you're here looking for solutions but have a different model, it may be worth giving this a go.&nbsp; All I had to do different was disregard the AMD Radeon HD 8800M uninstallation
 process, as mine doesn't have that.</div>

            Thanks for the concise description and fix! I've noticed windows updates always put me in a bad state and did not understand the order at which I had to reinstall these drivers. Hopefully this sticks now that the update is hidden.

<p>I have a 128 GB SSD in my system that's just used for Windows and software. When I installed Windows, a 350 MB System Reserved folder was created on the drive, then the rest of the drive is a single partition.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have 2 issues: -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. If I go into Optimise Drives, the current status for the System Reserved partition is "Needs optimisation", but if I click on the Optimise button, the Optimise Drives window disappears, reappears, but no optimisation has taken place. The error in Event
 Viewer is "The volume System Reserved was not optimised because an error was encountered: The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Windows 8.1 is defragmenting the C partition on my SSD. When I was trying to fix the issue mentioned above, I manually started automatic maintenance and I noticed that my SSD was being defragmented: -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f82438b-1c64-44ed-b7db-03be61cb2e88" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, if I search the event log for defrag-related events, that also shows that my SSD is being defragmented. You can also see all the errors related to the System Reserved partition as well: -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f679ab8-f501-4979-aefc-c6ec53823cf6" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also noticed that with Windows 8, it would occasionally defrag my C partition on my SSD, but I did not have the issue with the System Reserved partition on Windows 8 - just Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any idea what's causing this? The computer seems to run fine, so I have just excluded the C and System Reserved partitions from scheduled maintenance, but something is clearly not right here and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>So is this going to be fixed?, this was reported quite some time ago and it worked fine in Windows 8 (well it did for me),. Yet even in the release version of Windows 8.1 the optimisation will not work on the system partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is leading to some issues (as shown in the original topic).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So will this ever be fixed or are we no longer going to be able to run optimisations on the system partition?.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't have the defragging issue as posted above, but I do have the optimisation issue on the system partition - in that if I click optimise on the system partition it won't run and still states "never run" and "needs optimisation" - it also generates an
 error log that states "The volume System Reserved was not optimised because an error was encountered: The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This really needs to be looked into as I never had this issue in Windows 8 and yet I've seen quite a lot of reports of this not working in Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>So far the only people I've seen with the optimisation not working issue seem to be people on SSD's.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You need to run the optimisation to clear what looks like a load of junk being stored in the system partition (I mean you have 17mb available!), as the optimisation runs the trim command to force a clearance of all unneeded data - and until you can run the
 optimisation, you can't make a backup as it requires more than the available 17mb.</p>

<p>There is a way around your backup issue, but its more a brute force approach as it changes the size of the system partition to allow it to make one.&nbsp; I do see you tried this but it messed up and you had to go back to Windows 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I used a program called Partition Wizard (minitool) to fix my system partition size when I had a similar issue (mine was 100mb instead of 350mb).&nbsp; When you use Partition Wizard to adjust the size of the system partition it won't apply it until you next reboot
 the system, so you aren't making the change on a live OS.</p>

<p>I was able to adjust my partition from 100mb to 350mb quite easily using that.</p>

<p>you will see I used partwiz to attempt this last night... it failed... </p>
<p>BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING EXTRA....</p>
<p>IF YOU ATTEMPT A SYSTEM IMAGE (after you adjust system partition).....AND IT WORKS....... I BET YOU CANT RESTORE FROM THAT SYSTEM IMAGE....</p>
<p>LET ME KNOW HOW YOU GET ON.... YOU WILL MOST LIKELY GET A SYSTEM PARTITION READ/WRITE ERROR IF YOU ADJUST THE SYSTEM PARTITION....

            <p>I was able to create a system image after I adjusted the size without issue and use it - no error messages at all (in fact my system is now running pretty much perfect apart from the SSD system image optimise issue).</p>
<p><br />

<p>I think it is maybe due to my issue not quite being the same as your issue, my file size on my original system partition was 100mb but only 34mb of that was being used (and it worked to begin with). &nbsp;I adjusted my size to 350mb because that's the standard
 amount for Windows 8/8.1 and it hadn't been updated to 350mb during the 8/8.1 upgrade.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On your partition it was 350mb to begin with (the correct size for 8/8.1), BUT 333mb of that was being used (which is way to much), so it could be your system partition in general was messed up and mine wasn't - hence why my system image worked fine and
 yours didn't.</p>

Thanks for the reply ZiggyMoff, ive attempted the extension of the system partition twice and on both occasions it has resulted in 8.1 stop working properly, ie-- stuck in a boot loop, system partition read/write errors and had to reinstall windows 8.0... still
 awaiting a proper response from Microsoft.

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death After Splash Screen Then Restart Repeat Win XP</h2>
                    
<p>This an XP Sys&nbsp; With ASUS MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night I suddenly experienced the BSOD.&nbsp; I could not f why. The BSOD was too fast to read.&nbsp; Now I cannot boot into Windows(although a couple of time the desktop screen did come up brieflly and then BSOD again).</p>
<p>The recovery console would not work.&nbsp; I then looked for more solutions. Finally I figured all I could do was Use a Linux Live disk.&nbsp; So I went in and copied all necessary files to an external drive.</p>
<p>I plan to reinstall Windows tomorrow.&nbsp; I am posting for other possible solutions that are less drastic.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I can provide any necessary information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rocky</p>

<p><span>You have given us a general indication of the nature of the problem but specific error reports make finding a solution so much easier.</span></p>
<p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact
 text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code
 and related information properly. Right click on the My Computer icon on the Desktop and select Properties, Advanced, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure
 after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options
 Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right
 time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>

Hope this helps, Gerry Cornell

<p>Thank you-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is some info. related to my BSOD reboot problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message I receive on when trying to repair is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please jnsert floppy disk labeled NVIDIA Network Bus Unstallation &nbsp;Disk #1 abd then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I insert a drivers disk &nbsp;for my ASUS desktop motherboard it is asking for nvenetfd.inf.</p>
<p>I had downloaded additional drivers(besides this disk I put Nvidia nForce 430 chipset) but it cannot find file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At this point I cannot go further it just stops.</p>
<p>I hope this is enough information. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have not attempted a fresh install yet but it may be the only solution,As stated, I backed up hard drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>by going in with Linux disk.</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you referring to your preview pane? What you can do is turn off your preview pane so that way you’ll only see the subject of the massage
 from the list and delete it with opening it. Open up windows Mai &gt; Click on View &gt; choose Layout &gt; and change your reading pane to not preview your messages.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, please post back and let us know.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps. I would suggest you to use PowerShell command and try the below steps:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your keyboard.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>PowerShell</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the <strong>PowerShell</strong> icon on the taskbar and select <strong>
Run as Administrator</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If the right click is not working then go to my computer and search the "<strong>powershell</strong>" in the search bar at the top of explorer.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then you will find the shortcut icon of <strong>powershell</strong>, right click on
<strong>powershell </strong>and <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Now paste the following command in the Administrator: <strong>Windows PowerShell window
</strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong> key:<br />
<strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Wait few minutes</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Keep posting us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>
