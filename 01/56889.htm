<h2>            DVD Player  - Programs Compatibility Problem, InterActual Player.</h2>
                    I am trying to play a DVD on my new Dell Laptop which has Windows 8. On my old laptop I used to use Windows Media Player as it brought up the DVD straight away. However, when inserting the disk into the disk drive, it comes up with the InterActual Player;
 I have never used this program before so I am not used to the way it works, It says that there is&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;problem with program and tells me to look online for help. I followed the information on the site I was directed to but nothing seems to work. It
 is a Pirates of the Caribbean film but is not the one listed on the site. I have also done a compatibility troubleshoot for the program but still no luck. How do I fix this problem?

            <p>There is probably a problem within the computer itself in which it cannot play the DVD. If you click on the "?" at the top of the program then click "system profiler" you can review the direct results the InterActual Player program was able to receive from
 your computer. When I did this, I noticed that one of the results was "no DVD device&nbsp;found". That is a problem with compatibility that cant be resolved unless you&nbsp;get an adapter program&nbsp;or outside portable DVD runner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>... also the program was discontinued after 2008 and there hasn't been any updates, so it really just cant work on newer software.</p>

            Hi avanikukreja,
<br />
<br />The new Skype is a work in progress, it does have bugs and lacks functionality. 
<br />
<br />Until Microsoft resolve this, you should uninstall that version and reinstall the classic version of Skype. Hopefully before support for the Classic version ends, Microsoft may fix these bugs and lack of functionality . .. 
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app: 
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

            Hi Redlight150
<br />
<br />That application does not allow you to change the destination folder
<br />
<br />There may be a workaround . . .
<br />
<br />What is the exact name of your user profile folder - for example: C:\Users\Dave M
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of the resulting Registry Editor window . . .

 all. So not able to fix anything.&nbsp;

<p>My Dad updated to Windows 10 this morning but now can't use the PC at all because the screen keeps flickering. I have read some of the other suggestions about the display drivers but that isn't working, the iCloud is not installed and at the moment it won't
 let him reverse back to Windows 7 as it says all the files are gone.</p>
<p>So the PC is currently nothing but useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any suggestions?</p>

I guess you figured out, that in order to use Windows 10 is going up format put Windows 7 back on your system.<br />
I have two computers, one was running Windows 7 and the other was running Windows 8.1. I installed Windows 10, on the machine that was running Windows 7 loaded the and is working just fine. I waited two weeks before I decided to put Windows 10 onto my other
 computer that is running Windows 8.1. I did the upgrade last night, and the upgrade did not go well at all. It didn't look like it was installing everything properly but it didn't. Once it said it was done all I got was my main screen flickering and I could
 not click on or do anything with any of the icons, the only thing I could do because all my files everything was gone was to put Windows 7 back on the machine. I don't know why it did not go on my Windows 8.1 machine, the same as it did on my Windows 7 machine.
 The two machines are identical except for the operating system. You go figure.

            <p>Ok, so the screen is flickering and I've tried resetting to normal startup and it is still flickering as soon as I login.&nbsp; It seems like you people don't even read the actual description of someone's problem or maybe you have never dealt with the issue before...&nbsp;
 You can't navigate around the system because "The screen is flickering".&nbsp; How could you recommend running a safety scanner that is on a web page when I can't hardly click on anything or type because of the non-stop flickering???&nbsp; Can't get into control panel
 or check drivers - because ... wait for it ...&nbsp; The screen is flickering non-stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please offer a helpful solution that actually addresses the original post and can resolve the issue?</p>
<p>The system is clean and not infected so I don't need a safety scanner.&nbsp; The system had no problems prior to the
</p>
<p>Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I opened task manager Cntrl+Alt+Delete. I clicked Run new task from the top control menu. In the run box between flickers typed msconfig. Be patient and type quickly... eventually you should be able to get msconfig in.</p>
<p>Next change to "Normal boot" and apply and change settings to safe boot. &nbsp;Accept warning to reboot and cross your fingers and toes... standing on one leg might help as well but I can't confirm it.</p>

            <p>If we see the screen flickering after sign-in there are two possible causes – apps causing Explorer to crash, or display driver issues.
</p>
<p>To start, press this key combination:&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If this opens Task Manager and that window is NOT flickering:<br />
</strong>The likely cause is Software Compatibility issue causing Explorer.exe to crash repeatedly.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the File, Run option in Task Manager to open additional tools as-needed. Be sure to check the box to run tools as Administrator. These could include:<br />
appwiz.cpl:&nbsp; Opens Programs and Features<br />
compmgmt.msc: Opens Computer Management<br />
cmd.exe </li><li>You can search for crash events in the Event Logs and find if any third party DLLs are the faulting module in the Explorer,.exe crashes Or uninstall software that is likely to include shell extensions.
</li><li>If removing software does not resolve the issue, use these commands to repair Windows:
<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
sfc /scannow</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Removing these apps help resolve the issue: </p>
<ul>
<li>Norton Antivirus </li><li>Other AV solutions </li><li>iCloud </li><li>IDT Audio (faulting module IDTNC64.cpl)</li></ul>
<p><strong>If Task Manager is flickering, or it didn’t open, proceed with display driver troubleshooting:</strong><br />
The likely cause is a display driver or display hardware issue. </p>
<ol>
<li>Boot to Safe Mode with Networking. </li><li>Use the same steps here as for Black Screen issues – if dual chipset, disable built-in graphics, if still flickers, try with only the other chipset enabled.
</li><li>If this does not work, or there is only a single chipset, uninstall the device and remove the driver software.
</li><li>Then boot into Windows and update the drivers to the latest from the manufacturer.
</li></ol>
<p>How to stop flickering from the safemode</p>
<p>
</p><p>open task manager&nbsp;and now you will be&nbsp;able to Add new task&gt;CMD <br />
<br />
Ran : SFC Scan (Doesn't work) <br />
Ran : DISM Scan (Doesn't Work) <br />
<br />
CTRL+SHIFT+ESC <br />
<br />
File&gt;Run new task&gt;Must CHECK the Check Box <br />
<br />
MSCONFIG: Boot to safe boot [Check BOX] with network <br />
<br />
SAFE MODE: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
Uninstall : Norton Internet Security <br />
<br />
Msconfig : uncheck the following services: <br />
&gt; Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support <br />
&gt; Windows Error Reporting Service <br />
Now apply and OK, after computer restart, screen flickering issue will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use the following link to remove the Norton </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After stopping the screen from flicker, then open Norton Antivirus or any antivirus product which is installed in his compuer. The antivirus will ask for reinstallation, allow the permissions to start the installation. Once the installation gets completed,
 restart the computer. Now from device manager, try to update the VGA drivers and download all the drivers that are compatible for windows 10 from the manufacturer's website and then update all the drivers. Now enable the Problem Reports and Solutions Control
 Panel Support and Windows Error Reporting Services again to make sure that it reports about the errors of other applications.</p>

            No, unfortunately, that option is not available for Windows 10. The iPhone only makes that possible on Apple Mac.

<h2>            Windows Update failing on clean installation &#40;8024401C&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today my computer suddenly stopped accessing Windows Update.&nbsp; It was Win 7 and NOTHING had changed.&nbsp; However, assuming something had changed I restored the computer to a restore point a week ago, when I knew it was working.&nbsp; It still failed, so I decided
 to restore the computer with a full backup I had made three days ago, but then the computer just got locked into a startup error analysis and would not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Biting the bullet, I installed Win 8.1 on a different hard drive.&nbsp; I deleted the partition on the drive, created the partition and formatted it before doing a completely clean installation of 8.1.&nbsp; As soon as the installation was complete, I went to Windows
 Update but it came up with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There was a problem checking for updates. Error found: Code 8024401C&nbsp; Windows update ran into a problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the trouble shooter and the following came up (all saying they were fixed):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Service registration is missing or correupt</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows update error 0x80070003 (2014-12-10-T-10_01_37P)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems installing recent updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the trouble shooter several more times and the same things keep coming up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed Win 8.1 using the above procedure and the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no anti-virus software installed (yet) and no problem with the Ethernet connection (internet access and network access all excellent).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent all day on this (round about 10 hours so far), does anyone have any ideas please?&nbsp; The three laptops in the house all connect to Windows Update with no issues so it's not the router.&nbsp; I've run out of ideas!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

</p><p>No, a completely new one which I built myself in August and had been fine until a couple of days ago when the Windows Update Service suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; Overnight I have tried to reinstall a clean version of Win 7, and as soon as that was loaded tested
 the Win Update and this time received the same message but error code 80072EE2.&nbsp; I am at the moment doing a low level format of the boot drive (using a laptop) before I re-install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot understand how it can continually fail when doing a fresh installation.&nbsp; Any ideas please?</p>

            <p>So an update.&nbsp; The boot drive took 8 hours to do a low level format.&nbsp; Once complete I re-installed it and ran the Win 7 installation disc with both ethernet cables disconnected (ASuS z97 motherboard with dual gigabit ethernet).&nbsp; Once installed, I installed
 the ASuS drivers for the motherboard which allowed me to connect to the home network via Wi-Fi and Windows Update Service now works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did 7 clean installs using Win 7 and Win 8.1 before I did the low level reformat, but now it works.&nbsp; The first 130 updates are done and I shall slowly reconnect the USB devices and one ethernet at a time in case it is one of those devices causing Windows
 Update Service to fail.&nbsp; If I discover which one, I will post it here.</p>

</p><p>1a.&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; All installed.</p>
<p>1b.&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; Not installed.</p>
<p>2. &amp; 3.&nbsp; Not installed.&nbsp; I'm installing as little as possible until I nail the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered so far is that there are no problems when I connect using WiFi.&nbsp; As soon as I connected both ethernet cables, I got the error again (80072EE2).&nbsp; So I have been trying various combinations of cables and sockets, and the upshot is that
 my No1 LAN connection is causing the failure.&nbsp; I even tried a fresh cable out of the bag.&nbsp; I will try re-installing the latest Intel driver for the LAN ports and try that port again and post the results here.&nbsp; For the time being however, it looks like a hardware
 failure has caused this.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the continued help.&nbsp; It is most perplexing.&nbsp; But it is most definitely a LAN port issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap:</p>
<p>There are three network connections.</p>
<p>LAN port 1 running at 1Gbps</p>
<p>LAN port 2 running at 1Gbps</p>
<p>WiFi&nbsp; running at 866Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three independently can access the internet and my home network (as proved by disconnecting the other 2 connections), can transfer files, stream music/video or do pretty much anything.&nbsp; When all three connections are made simultaneously the same applies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer uses whichever connection was last in use, so by disconnecting LAN port 1 and WiFi, it will predominantly use LAN port 2 until it maxes out and then use one of the other ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered through hours of connecting and disconnecting the various connections and swapping cables around, is that Windows Update Service will ONLY run over WiFi.&nbsp; Trying to use a LAN port results in the 800722EE2 error every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in reply to your post above PA Bear, I have a cable connection.&nbsp; Connecting directly to the cable box does nothing as I'm unable to log onto my ISP through Windows (well I haven't found a way anyway).&nbsp; I have reset my router and checked it has the latest
 firmware.&nbsp; I don't use Windows Defender, it's disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So having established it's a LAN problem I tried my Win 7 Pro laptop.&nbsp; Using WiFi, Windows Update Service runs just fine, however if I switch off the WiFi and use an Ethernet cable, I get the 800722EE2 error every time.&nbsp; It therefore looks like the router
 may be at fault.&nbsp; Is there a particular port that WUS uses over the LAN connection?&nbsp; Or would you have any other ideas please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Sorry PA Bear, should have been clearer.&nbsp; Windows Defender is not enabled because Norton Internet Security is installed and active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The low level format took from 0700 until 1430 on Thu Dec 11th.&nbsp; I then did the clean install of Win 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have found to date is that I am unable to access Windows Update Service over an Ethernet connection.&nbsp; Accessing over WiFi is fine, but not over the wired LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now&nbsp;verified this with three other laptops in the house. They can all access WUS over WiFi, but not when connected via (different) Ethernet cables.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected, via Ethernet, directly to the cable modem and can then access WUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This therefore points to a problem with the router and there must be something on the Ethernet port side which is preventing Windows Update Service from connecting and thus causing the error.&nbsp; Why this suddenly occurred is a bit of a mystery, but one which
 I am still trying to resolve.</p>

<p>he is talking about the twenty digit code we got with our hardened edition games... that code will only be used if u did not activate ur elite account by the 18th( i think is the date) to verify that u will have permanent founder status... but if u use the
 25 digit code in the marketplace redeem code area to activate it u are sealed and dealed... just gotta see what happens when the founder stuff actually shows up when beachhead fixes the overload... but it is a bad @@@ business card for all those who bought

<h2>            Icons Not The Same In Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I made a desktop shortcut to Youtube, which has this nice icon that came with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e96af7fb-87ff-470b-9334-7bfec90b248f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e96af7fb-87ff-470b-9334-7bfec90b248f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But when I bring it to the start menu, it only shows the Chrome Icon.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ae319b8-f2b7-40e5-921f-9e9313557676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ae319b8-f2b7-40e5-921f-9e9313557676" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Google Chrome's icon for Google Chrome, i'm fine with. Its only the Youtube icon.</p>
<p>I just need to know if there's a way to get the Youtube icon to the start menu.</p>
<p>I only suspected it was a problem with Windows because the icon is already in the apps area (1st picture), but not the start menu (2nd picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a way to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I simply added a shortcut to the desktop using "Add to desktop"</p>
<p>It's not an app, but I have tried to re-create the shortcut, and the icon still doesn't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found out the same thing happens to all types of Chrome shortcuts.</p>

            <p>Hi Connor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot, what you're accomplishing is saving the webpage itself. If you want to create a shortcut to your Desktop, here are steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to the desktop.&nbsp; To get there from the start screen click the tile that says "Desktop".<br />
2.&nbsp; Right click where you want the shortcut.<br />
3.&nbsp; Put the arrow on "New".<br />
4.&nbsp; From the menu that shows up click "Shortcut".<br />
5.&nbsp; Click "Browse".<br />
6.&nbsp; Click "Computer".<br />
7.&nbsp; Click "OS (C:)".<br />
8.&nbsp; Click "Program Files".<br />
9.&nbsp; Click "Internet Explorer".<br />
10.&nbsp; Click "iexplore" so it is highlighted and then click "ok".<br />
11.&nbsp; Click "Next".<br />
12.&nbsp; Type a new name or leave it as "iexplore" (this is the name that will appear on the desktop).<br />
13.&nbsp; Click "Finish".<br />
The shortcut should show up on your desktop.<br />
<br />
Method 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to the desktop.&nbsp; To get there from the start screen click the tile that says "Desktop".<br />
2.&nbsp; Right click on the Internet Explorer Icon in the taskbar.<br />
3.&nbsp; From the list that comes up right click on "Internet Explorer".<br />
4.&nbsp; Click "Properties".<br />
5.&nbsp; Click the "Shortcut" tab.<br />
6.&nbsp; Click "Open File Location".<br />
7.&nbsp; Right click "iexplore".<br />
8.&nbsp; Click "Create Shortcut".<br />
9.&nbsp; Click "Yes".<br />
That sends a shortcut to the desktop.&nbsp; Close the open windows by clicking "x".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p>

<h2>            Share folder with everyone &#40;read&#41; and give specific access &#40;read&#47;write&#41; to network user</h2>
                    I have multiple machines all connected to the same network. &nbsp;I am setting up folder sharing. &nbsp;Here is what works:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Share a folder on the network that everyone can read</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Share a folder on the network that everyone can read/write</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what does NOT work</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Share a folder on the network that everyone can read, but "UserA" can read/write</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"UserA" exists on all my computers with the same password on each. &nbsp;On PC1 I have created all the shared folders. &nbsp;I am attempting to access the shared folders from PC2. &nbsp;Again, the "UserA" account exists on both pcs and has the same password. &nbsp;However
 when I access the shared folder, I can read the contents, but I have now write access. &nbsp;When attempting to create a new file in the shared folder, I get an access denied error saying "You need permission to perfom this action".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't understand why I am getting this error. &nbsp;On PC1 (where I created the shared folder), I did the "Advanced Sharing" option. &nbsp;Then I added the "Everyone" user with read permissions and the UserA user with read/write permissions. &nbsp;Then I went into
 the "Security" tab and added UserA with read/write permissions there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I doing something wrong here? &nbsp;What is the proper way to share folders on the network with specific permissions for a user account that exists on all the pcs in the workgroup?</div>
                </div>

So with the new ps4 exclusives coming out, I thought I'd use an emulator on my PC to play the games. But I was wondering if I can use my Xbox one controller with a ps4 emulator, and if not, does anyone know a method to get around the problem and make it possible?</p>

I'm not sure if it's ethical to ask this here, but worth a shot I guess.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer has stopped working</h2>
                    My HP laptop is a year old. For the first 3 or 4 months it worked perfectly but since then every time - EVERY TIME - I power on I see a box telling me that Windows Explorer has stopped working. Then another box telling me Windows is seeking information
 'and could take a few minutes' but within a few seconds the 'Windows Explorer has stopped working' box appears again. &nbsp;This ALWAYS happens at least twice (occasionally 3 times) before Explorer does apparently work properly. It only occurs on start up, never
 any other time. &nbsp;Each time the 'stopped working' box appears all the screen icons disappear then reappear as Explorer tries again. I should add I am a complete tyro, aged tyro as my wife calls me, with computers.
<div>Any solutions would be gratefully received.</div>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>win10 fresh start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjl1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            win10 fresh start</h2>
                    <p>So being&nbsp; curious about the new defender security center decided to take a look as to what some of the links in the settings are tied too.</p>
<p>Selecting device performance and health&nbsp; on the bottom fresh start with an additional information highlight link, two option, get started or more information, the second brings the user to this page detailing more of what will be kept and removed;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4012986/windows-defender-track-your-device-performance-health</p>
<p>As defender fresh start gives a brief description the web page gives much more detail of what will be removed; almost everything.</p>
<p>What I find as a low down way of MS any OEM'S devices to keep native programs on the system being compatible to run on the hardware, so why does&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS just plain&nbsp; this program X will not work on the new updates and it will not work on the next build(s).</p>
<p>Instead MS places the burden of removing a few or thousands of programs as what seems to be a user choice&nbsp; &nbsp;but in fact is nothing more than keeping&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS apps installed and gutting everything else; as clean install would do the same and have&nbsp; less issues all around.</p>
<p>On the only hp laptop upgraded from win7 to win10 I have seen this first hand as win10 sept 2017 updates fail to install on this system from WU or standalone.</p>
<p>Hp software, skype (removed), device drivers and software that win10 has limited or no drivers for is just another way of retiring the device so we either pay for tech support or buy a new device.</p>
<p>So if you have done a fresh start or clean install do not be surprised that it may take hours to days to get the system back to normal and even then it may&nbsp;</p>
<p>not fully recover, but you can get an app for that, linux.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what all that meant, but part of it seems to be a comment about the length of time needed for a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with many things in life, the better prepared you are, the easier it is. My clean install of Windows 10 went like this - from my notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading the ISO was slightly under 5 minutes - I have a great broadband connection the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Windows 10 was 22 minutes, almost exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows Update to completion took 92 minutes. I had more than a year's worth of updates to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next steps depend on how well prepared you are, and how picky you are. I was well-prepared but I am also very picky. Everything has to be just right. I spent about 5 hours installing all my software and setting up everything just the way I like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'll never have to do that again. Because as soon as I was finished I made an image backup of my computer, which took about 14 minutes, including time for verifying the image. Now, instead of doing all that work again, I can simply restore the image
 I made, which should take about 6 minutes. That's how long it takes me to do a 'fresh start' ... 6 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I won't do that either. Because I make an image backup every day. So if my experiments on my computer make a mess of things - which they do - I just restore yesterday's image and in 6 minutes I'm back to where I was as if nothing happened.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One overheating &#47; smoking</h2>
                    
<p>this morning while watching tv my console shut off randomly, I went to turn it back on and it would turn on I checked the power strip to make sure it it was the outlet, then I started smelling a electrical burning smell, I assumed it was my Xbox One and
 unplugged it and plugged in the power brick somewhere else, it wouldn't turn back on and then out of no where it started smoking for about a minute or two. i hurried up and recorded it but my phone was low on storage so i couldnt get it more on film.
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVJ-wqK9wk<br />
I called 1-800-4-MY-XBOX and they had a supervisor talk to me and he said that i could send my xbox in and it would take 3-4 weeks or use the express which took like 3-4 days but i would be billed temporarily for the console. Gamestop said I could just take
 it to them and get it replaced. I dont know what to do.</p>

<p>Personally if it were me - take it to Gamestop - if they have the stock that is. Faster turn around and less stress for you. Good luck</p>

            Hey&nbsp;Jeff Nathan,
<div><br />
<div>I am going to split my reply, first will be to your original question, below that will be to your first reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To the missing file pop up, follow the thread below, a tool built into Windows 7 can help clear that error.&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprogeneral/thread/2b375209-aa3c-499f-b832-6192c359fd74/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprogeneral/thread/2b375209-aa3c-499f-b832-6192c359fd74/</a>
<div><br />
<div>Try the system file checker, and let us know if that works for you. I know you said you did it, but it is a confirmed answer, so I think one more try is important.</div>
<div><br />
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now to your reply,</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you get windows pre-installed, it is referred to as the OEM version. If you contact the&nbsp;manufacturer of your computer, they should be able to get you this Disc, then you can just "repair" your windows instead of a clean install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your question about installing your wife's version is a bad idea. Each OEM has a&nbsp;registry written for that specific system, and I am confident saying that would be a bigger headache then this issue lol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try the system file checker, and return to us with your results. It should list the scan and results, so post those in your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for posting to Microsoft Answers and good luck troubleshooting.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There may be a slight glitch in the system so if you reset it, that should help.</p>
<p>I've had success with the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Remove profile - SETTINGS page (far right from home page), select STORAGE, then find your profile and remove.</p>
<p>2. While in your hard drive under GAMES &amp; APPS look for any red or yellow icons with incomplete or unknown. &nbsp;Delete them. &nbsp;(This may include the game you are trying to fix)</p>
<p>3.Clear System Cache - SETTINGS page, select STORAGE and highlight a drive but don't select it. &nbsp;Press Y and select Clear System Cache. &nbsp;Agree when asked.</p>
<p>4. Be Patient - turn your console off for a full minute. &nbsp;This assists in resetting the console.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the console and download your profile - it is the icon next to 'create a profile'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Try again. &nbsp;If it is still an issue repeat the steps but at Step 2 delete the troublesome game and complete the steps with the following.</p>
<p>6. Go to SETTINGS page &amp; select ACCOUNT</p>
<p>7. Got to DOWNLOAD HISTORY and find the game/DLC you wanted. &nbsp;The most recent are first.</p>
<p>8. Select the item and then select DOWNLOAD AGAIN. &nbsp;This should fix the issue.</p>
<p>If you still have issues please feel free to write here again.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this system saying your key isn't correct when you are installing XP? Just wondering because when you say How can I activate my windows? - What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also have you checked that the B and 8 are entered correctly and anymore that may be slightly the same.</p>

<div>I suspect that you may be using the wrong type of disk for your Key.</div>
<div>If your Key is for a Retail disk, then you cannot use it with OEM Media - and vice-versa.</div>
<div>Is your packaging Retail (it sounds like it is, as the OEM packing is a shrink-wrapped cardboard-stiffened CD sleeve, rather than a case)</div>
<div>Does the disk have 'Only for installation on a New PC' embedded in the hologram? - or is it a OEM manufacturer's disk? - or is it a hologrammed MS Retail disk without the wording?</div>

<div>You have a major problem!</div>
<div>Your software disk claims it's from a Dell PC - which it probably is.</div>
<div>It's therefore an OEM disk (by definition - and by design)</div>
<div>It is therefore outside the license terms to install it on any other PC than the one on which it was originally installed - and you state that your PC is not a Dell.</div>
<div>Do you have a COA License sticker on the machine? - if so, what is the version and edition of Windows quoted there (or any other info, but do NOT post the entire Product Key - the last three blocks of 5 characters will give us enough of a handle on the
 situation!)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be good for all concerned if you posted the MGADiag report for your machine, so that we all know what we are talking about. The MGADiag tool is available here -<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a>&nbsp;-
 download it to the desktop, run it, click Continue to start the diagnosis - when it's finished, click on the Copy button, and then paste the results into your response.</div>

            So is there no way to convert an installation of one type to another without starting from scratch? &nbsp;Seems like there must just be a few critical files that makes an OEM different than a&nbsp;Retail, etc.

<br />
When you say "replaced CPU" what EXACTLY have you done? "CPU" stands for Central Processing Unit - which is the microchip processor on the motherboard. If you have replaced something else then you need to be very specific as to what you have replaced..

<p><br />
OK. Did your copy of XP come pre-installed on the old computer?</p>
<p>If so then it's highly probable that it is OEM and that means you CANNOT transfer it to a new computer.</p>
<p>You have to buy another copy...</p>

<p>The word used for that is usually just simply "computer." As Gordon<br />
said, "CPU" is completely wrong for that, and is the name of an<br />
electronic chip within that box.</p>
<p>Not to give you a hard time about the words you use, but it's<br />
important to get them right. If you don't, you run the sizable risk<br />
that you will confuse those people trying to help you. I, for example,<br />
didn't understand your question until you posted this clarifying<br />
message.</p>
<p>But read on for the answer to your question, "*I have replaced my CPU,<br />
and thought I could use my existing copy of Windows XP Home Edition.<br />
When I try to load it, I get a code invalid message.* *Is there a way<br />
to activate, or do I have to buy a new one each time my computer<br />
dies?*"</p>
<p>The answer depends on whether you have a retail version of Windows or<br />
an OEM one (for example, if your computer came with Windows<br />
pre-installed, it's an OEM Version). If it's a retail version, there's<br />
no problem and you can move it from computer to computer as often as<br />
you need to or want to. If activation by internet doesn't work, you<br />
can always activate by phone call.</p>
<p>But with an OEM version, no, you can not do this; the biggest<br />
disadvantage of an OEM version is that its license ties it permanently<br />
to the first computer it's installed on. It can never legally be moved<br />
to another computer, sold, or given away (except with the original<br />
computer). If the computer dies or is stolen, your license dies with<br />
it.</p>

<p>Hey there Hljones, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. Now I know this might be a silly question, But the bundle should have come with a prepaid code for the Game Pass subscription, Have you redeemed that code to your account already?
</p>
<p>If you have already redeemed the code, go ahead and take a look at the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/xbox-game-pass-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Game Pass FAQ</a> for more information on accessing the games.</p>

            Head to the xbox store and redeem your code. After that you can browse the many dif games that are available on xbox game pass. You can do this in the xbox store. Pick which one you want and download it.

<p>Hey there first let's make sure you have redeemed the code that would have been printed on a flyer inside the box</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10604/microsoft-account-redeem-gift-card-or-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to redeem a code on xbox</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second after the game pass code is redeemed you can find all the available games two ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) From the main menu at start up you can scroll to the right until you hit the game pass tab. This way will allow you to look through the game pass divided into multiple categories, so you can look for specific games you may like.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) You can go to my games and apps and scroll down to the game pass section there. This way will show all the games in a-z order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you find a game you wish to download and play, select it and you should see a button that says "install" select that to begin your installation of the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you.</p>
