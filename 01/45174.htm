            Hi, 
<br />such difference is absolutely normal.
<br />Size of disk is calculated on the base of disk itself, size of the folder (a root folder too) - on the base of files this user have access to.
<br />There are files on disk unavailable and invisible for user so they will not be count in size of C:.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue occurs if there is a drive letter conflict. A drive letter conflict occurs if the disk that is affected by the error is mapped to a reserved drive letter.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try changing the drive letter and then check if you’re able to access the drive and boot the computer successfully with the drive plugged in.</span></p>

    <title>MW3 DLC wont download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshpal83  say:</h3>
<h2>            MW3 DLC wont download</h2>
                    
<p><span>I recently purchased the map packs "Collection 2" and "Collection 3" for Call of duty modern warfare 3. &nbsp;I also redeemed a token for "Collection 1" that was included with my newly purchased copy of the game. &nbsp;All 3 of these were very small downloads,
 unlock keys if you will that allow you to download the maps from the in game store. &nbsp;After I loaded the game and downloaded the title update I went to the in game store. &nbsp;There is an option to download all available maps and that is what i did. &nbsp;After hitting
 confirm on the typical xbox checkout page, I was given error code 80153003. &nbsp;Many of the maps were put in my active downloads but they wouldn't download and had to be canceled. I followed all options given on the xbox support page about that error code including
 clearing the cache, deleting marketplace data, restarting the system and deleting all files for the game and starting from scratch again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;I also tried only downloading one of the unlock keys and then trying to download only those maps, still got the same error code. &nbsp;All other aspects of xbox live are working for me including playing multiplayer, downloading files from my purchase history,
 and purchasing new content and downloading files. &nbsp;It seems to be an issue with the in game store. &nbsp;After speaking with xbox chat support, they told me to contact activision. &nbsp;They were also unable to help me and basically told me to do what I had already
 done. &nbsp;I also tried to download the files with my older xbox(arcade with HD) but still got the same error, so it has nothing to do with the equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a feeling if I could have those maps put in purchase history then I would be able to download them no problem. &nbsp;I know Activision is closing down the elite service and the maps are all titled elite drops, so that maybe a problem. &nbsp;But if thats the
 case then why were they on sale last week? &nbsp;Need real help!!</p>

<p>I am Beanboy83, an XBOX Live Ambassador. &nbsp;I understand you are having problems downloading some items. &nbsp;According to the error code you listed, XBOX.com came up with the following suggestions.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. &nbsp;If not, let us know and we will try to be of further assistance. &nbsp;Good Day and Game On!</p>
<p>Error code 80153003 occurs when you’re using Xbox Live</p>
<p>Problem</p>
<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to download or purchase content from Xbox Live:</p>
<p>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Status Code: 80153003</p>
<p>This may mean that the download or purchase failed.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>Solution 1: Delete old data and clear your cache</p>
<p>First, try to update your Xbox Live information by clearing your cache. You may have an older version of the item you’re trying to download or purchase on your console. Here’s how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Delete the Marketplace System Data. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage, and then select your primary storage device.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select System Items.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Content Cache, and then select Delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clear your console cache. Here’s how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select. The cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you’re prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Restart your Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Retry your purchase or download from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If you continue to receive this error message, there may be a problem with the offer on Xbox Live and you need to contact Xbox Support.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Delete the content and download it again</p>
<p>Delete any active downloads from the active downloads screen, delete any partially downloaded content, and then try to download the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Games &amp; Apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Active Downloads, then select Cancel All.</p>
<p>Now that the active downloads are cancelled, delete any partially downloaded content. Here’s how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on the controller, then go to Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage, then select your storage device.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press X on your controller for Deletion Suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Scroll through the suggestions and delete any content that has a yellow exclamation point. The exclamation point indicates content that is incomplete or corrupted.</p>
<p>Now that the partially downloaded content has been deleted, try downloading the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to the Settings hub and select Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Download History.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the item you were having problems downloading.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Download Again.</p>
<p>If the content still doesn’t download completely, try the next solution.</p>
<p>Solution 3: Make sure you’re connected to Xbox Live</p>
<p>Test your connection to Xbox Live to make sure that a faulty connection is not the problem. Here’s how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller (Xbox button in the center of your controller).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Network Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select your wireless network or Wired Network if you are prompted to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Test Xbox Live Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Yes if you are prompted to update your console software.</p>
<p>When you’re successfully connected to Xbox Live, your screen will look like this:</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>If you’re connected to Xbox Live and still can’t download the content, try the next solution.</p>
<p>Solution 4: Request a repair</p>
<p>If the previous solutions don't resolve the problem, go to the Online Service Center and click Start Request to request a repair.</p>

<p>Yea I went through all of those steps, multiple times actually, and still get the same result. &nbsp;I cant imagine that it's the xbox either because I got the same error code when I tried it on both my 360s(Arcade and E). &nbsp;I tried several different orders to
 how I tried after deleting everything. &nbsp;I should also note that I was able to download the 2 map packs that are free to everyone through the in game store, along with downloading the Collection 1, 2 and 3 unlock keys. &nbsp;It just wont let me get all the "Elite
 drops" which is the actual content I paid for.</p>

<p>Same problem for past 2 days. Download anything and everything from XBL Marketplace just fine. Just the in-game MW3 Collection packs. Tried all their solutions, numerous times. Like the original post, I also got the free maps through Marketplace without
 a problem.... I also tried deleting my Collection keys and redownloading them (even individually) and still get the error code. Also tried on my other system, same problem.

<p>Even with the error code, it still populates the downloads to my Active Downloads. If I let them run (either in-game or out of game) they run up to 99%, then says 0%, then 98/99%, then 0%... repeat a few times and then it cancels the download.</p>
<p>Sounds like it's happening to lots of people in a short period of time and I search through forums here and outside of the xbox website.</p>

<p>As I continued to search, this may fall back on Activision. The Collection 1, 2, and 3 maps are called Elite Drops. As of Feb 28, 2014, they took Call of Duty Elite offline.</p>

<p>You would hope they would have foreseen this, especially since they were part of the "Deal of the Week" til March 3rd. &nbsp;Considering how much &nbsp;money Activision and Microsoft make together on COD this should never be happening.</p>

            Hi, the first thing to check would be that you have the hdmi cable in the correct port on the xbox, that would be the port nearest to the power cable and will be marked as the Tv output.

            Do you see anything at all when you press the white Home button on the controller? Sometimes when I start my Xbox One up, I get a black screen and I have to press the white Home button which will open the side bar menu. Then I press Home and it brings
 up the home screen. It's very strange but I get this black screen sometimes too.

    <title>Upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> narayananmoothiringode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Compaq desktop, with Windows7 (2009)&nbsp;installed. Upgrading to Windows 10 has not been successful so far. I have tried upgrading using Get Windows 10 app, MCT, MCT &amp; USB and DVD. All have failed. Many a times, downloading and installation/upgrading
 goes through till the end, but at the very end it rolls back to Windows 7. I have tried upgrading from Windows 7 as also clean installation of Win 10. Different error codes are displayed at different times. HP Support Assistant does not indicate that&nbsp;any update
 is necessary to drivers/BIOS.</p>
<p>Today, 16 Dec 2015, I downloaded Media Creation Tool (to get the latest)&nbsp;again and created the media in a USB. After booting up Windows 7, I launched Win 10 upgrade from the USB. After several hours (getting updates took forever), upgrade failed in the end.
 Error code displayed is 0x80007025D - 0x2000C with the message, "The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase witherror during APPLY_IMAGE operation". This message has not been seen before.</p>
<p>What does it mean and how to fix it?</p>

 block it at download stage itself, shouldn't they?</p>
<p>I have checked all drivers using Device Manager and they are all up-to-date.</p>
<p>I have tried upgrading to Win 10 after 'clean boot' too, but no luck with that too.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Thanks again, Andre. No luck.</p>
<p>I ran <strong>Fix problems with </strong><strong>Windows Updates</strong> (only the path was different,
<strong>Start &gt; Control Panel </strong>etc.), checked for updates, Win 10 came up and ran the update. But it failed and the&nbsp;error code shown was&nbsp;80200053.</p>
<p>I had tried with Security Essentials disabled (earlier with it uninstalled too), with and without
<strong>Clean Boot, </strong>but the upgrade failed.</p>
<p>Other error codes today: 0x80070570-0x90002 and 0x80070570-0xA0003.</p>
<p>I have checked all the drivers in <strong>Device Manager</strong>, one by one, and all are up-to-date. I have uninstalled (since 'disable' did not work for the update)&nbsp;the built-in SD card reader too (now I am foxed how to reinstall it).</p>
<p>X'Mas didn't bring success. Please wish me a happy Win10 new year.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Andre. This is only an interim reply (because I plan to follow all the steps given in your earlier reply).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I still have not been able to upgrade to Windows 10. When I checked the PC via the HP Support site, at first it listed six driver updates and four original drivers; BIOS was not listed at all. When I checked again after a while, only the original drivers
 were listed. After installing HP Support Assistant and checking for updates, no updates are available. I suppose the Assistant has updated everything. In any case no BIOS update was indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Trying my luck, I disabled Security Essentials and launched Windows update from HP Support Assistant. This time around the pop-ups were different and updating almost succeeded.</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Windows Update screen came up, showing "Downloading Windows 10. Preparing for installation...."</li><li>b) The next screen said "Great, we'll get upgrade started" followed by license terms. I accepted.</li><li>c) Next: "Your upgrade is ready to install" with the options "Schedule it for later" and "Start the upgrade now". I chose to upgrade immediately.</li><li>d)Then everything seemed to be going fine, till a <strong>black screen</strong> came up that said:-<br />
<em>Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings, then click "Next".<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer".<br />
If you do not have this disc, contact system administrator etc.<br />
File: /windows/system32/ntoskrnl.exe</em>&nbsp; [Actually, the slashes are back slashes]<br />
<em>Status: 0xc0000221<br />
Info: The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors.</em></li></ul>
<p>When I checked Windows update history, error code C1900101 was shown. There was no way in the black screen to do the fixes given in d) 1, 2 &amp; 3. [that is, there was no option to restart,&nbsp;select language or repair the computer. When I pressed the shut-down
 button, the PC switched off<strong> instantly</strong>, which might indicate that the black screen was outside Windows 7 environment. When I started the computer again, Windows 7 booted up without a hitch. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks again. Happy New Year!PS: I have tried Tech Bench before, downloading and extracting files. I will try again.</p>

            <p><strong>Done</strong>. The upgrade to Win 10 was <strong>successful </strong>yesterday. Win 10 was released on July 29 and I could, at last,&nbsp;upgrade on Dec 29.</p>
<p>Yesterday I downloaded <strong>Win10_1511_English_x32</strong> from TechBench and burned a DVD, my third one. I
<strong>uninstalled Security Essentials</strong>, the only anti-virus installed. Then I disconnected the Internet connection and did a
<strong>clean re-boot</strong>. While <strong>off-line</strong>, I launched the DVD from within Win 7 and upgraded to Win 10.&nbsp;I also found&nbsp;that it&nbsp;had been&nbsp;activated automatically (after I logged in to Internet connection again)&nbsp;and a digital entitlement was
 in place. All my files and settings are as they were.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Andre.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mayank Gupta too, even though I did not have to use his suggestions.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Are you able to boot in the safe mode?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to computer just before this issue occurred?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we re-install the Windows you may want to try the below methods.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
First of all check if there are any external devices connected to the computer, if yes remove them and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>Start your computer in safe mode&nbsp;and then set your computer to the clean startup and check if it boots properly. If it boots properly may be a third party application or a service is causing the issue.</div>
<div>Refer:<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />

<p>We can use 50-50 approach to narrow down the root cause of the issue. Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.</p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updater, Possibly Corrupted, Affected Multiple EXEs as Bad Images</h2>
                    <p>I've been fighting Windows Updater for some time now, and whatever update it's been trying to repeatedly install only results in failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relatively often, after the PC will restart to implement updates, the boot up will take you to a blue screen with several fix options. Occasionally the PC fails to boot correctly, and takes you to other pages with backup restore recommendations. Today the
 issue compounded with popups on restart stating which files are now unusable as Bad Images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried /Scannow, have also tried:</p>
<p>Windows Troubleshooter- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter</p>
<p>Manual Update- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>System Update Readiness Tool- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness</p>
<p>
</p><p>The System Update Readiness Tool, run as /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth resulted in an 'Error: 0x800f081f', saying source files could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been able to run most severe issues &amp; fixes myself in the past, but this has confounded me. I'm not sure how to proceed.</p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc

<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc

<h2>            Can&#39;t find target path of internet shortcuts__Problems with Windows snap feature and taskbar.__Taskbar and toolbar problems.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have two major problems that are with the Windows OS.&nbsp; One is a new problem I did not have in XP.&nbsp; The other has been a problem since I had Windows ME and I thought it would be fixed by now.</p>
<p>First problem is that many shortcuts I have are actually internet shortcuts.&nbsp; I do not understand this since they are linking to a file on the hard drive.&nbsp; These shortcuts are mainly being created by "Steam".&nbsp; My problem is that I want to find the target
 path of the shortcut to find the program that it executes.&nbsp; But what I have done for years, which is click on properties (or get info on a mac) is not showing that information.&nbsp; This is a basic feature of an OS.&nbsp; And I am really annoyed that this isn't simple.&nbsp;
 My computer knows the location of the file.&nbsp; That information has to be stored in the shortcut.&nbsp; So where is the information??&nbsp; How do I find out what file the shortcut is linked to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second problem is even more annoying because I have lived with it for a decade or more.&nbsp; I have always placed the start menu on the top of the screen.&nbsp; I have also always added several toolbars on the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Now windows has removed the ability
 to add toolbars that aren't directly attached to the taskbar.&nbsp; Which I think is idiotic.&nbsp; But since I am sure that is how it has been designed there seems little point to complain about a fault of this type.&nbsp; The problem I am hoping can be fixed is this:</p>
<p>Often when dealing with a window it will, in some way or another, stretch to the point that the resizing box in the bottom right of the window is no longer on the screen and is in fact below what is visible on the screen.&nbsp; Which makes the window impossible
 to resize.&nbsp; All I can do is maximize, un-maximize, or minimize.&nbsp; I cannot resize it to be smaller.&nbsp; This is happening on Windows 7 more then I have ever experienced in the past now that the windows automatically snap and maximize when they are dragged to the
 taskbar.&nbsp; So I will have windows that I can either close, minimize or they can take up most of the screen.&nbsp; This is especially bad on windows where the only method of resizing is the bottom right triangle thing and cannot be resized from the sides of the window.</p>
<p><br />
If the window can be resized from the side of the window then I will use that to resize it and it will automatically shrink vertically (resize to fit on screen) so that the bottom of the window is once again visible on the screen.&nbsp; But when a window only has
 the one triangle box to resize I have no way to fix it except to move the taskbar off the top of the screen to another side, then resize the window, and then put the taskbar back.</p>
<p>This problem only seems to happen if the taskbar is on the top of the screen instead of the default bottom.&nbsp; I am extremely annoyed that I am still dealing with this design flaw for so long.&nbsp; I have a lot of doubt that it can even be fixed with out a lot
 of work.&nbsp; And to be honest if the taskbar was functional like it was in XP and I was able to move toolbars to any part of the screen seperately from the taskbar like in XP. I would not really care very much about the window problem.</p>
<p>In my opinion microsoft has really screwed up after XP.&nbsp; I held out and didn't get Vista but Windows 7 still has a lot of annoying new quirks and I have seen little to no worthy improvement to the OS as a whole.</p>
<p>If XP still had all the gaming functions of 7 I would still be using it instead of wasting money on 7, which with so many faults doesn't feel like an upgrade.&nbsp; Can you tell I'm annoyed? Costs hundreds to do a worse job then the OS I had.</p>
<p>I have installed a dock type app that I have put on the bottom in place of the toolbars, but I prefer the toolbars in XP. I also miss the way XP searched for files.</p>
<p>Why try to do a complete overhaul on that which isn't broken?</p>

 options or tabs do you see in shortcut properties? What do you see in the Target Path? It should contain the path to the shortcut. If you click on the Open Location button, the target path should open. On the top of the screen, you should be able to see the
 location where the .exe lies.</span></span></p>

 exactly happens when you try to double-click on those shortcuts?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you drag a window to top or sides of the screen they result in maximizing or covering half of the screen. This is by design.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can minimize the screen by using the Windows Logo key. If you minimize a window by pressing Windows logo key + Down Arrow, you can restore it by clicking its preview
 on the taskbar, or by pressing Shift and right-clicking the program’s button on the taskbar, and then clicking Restore.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some other options, you might look at to help with your minimize screen issue is to use the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using Alt+Tab. You can switch to the previous window by pressing Alt+Tab, or cycle through all open windows and the desktop by holding down Alt and repeatedly pressing
 Tab. Release Alt to show the selected window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using Aero Flip 3D. Aero Flip 3D arranges your windows in a three-dimensional stack that you can quickly flip through.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, the shortcuts I am referring to were generated by the "Steam" application and their file type is listed as Internet Shortcut.&nbsp; The tabs that come up in properties are: General, Web Document, Security, Details, Previous Versions.</p>
Double clicking the shortcut opens the program file that it is apparently linked to.&nbsp; None of the tabs mentioned above contain any shortcut paths.&nbsp; I have been dealing with this only since I upgraded to Windows 7.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that dragging the windows to the top of the screen maximizes it to fit neatly in half the screen.&nbsp; I am aware of Alt-Tabbing, minimizing, restoring, and other basic windows features.</p>
<p>My problem is that the top bar of the window, the bar which you can use to click and drag to move the window around will occasionally become covered by the taskbar.&nbsp; So in other words it will be hidden behind the taskbar.&nbsp; I am still able to switch to the
 window, minimize it and restore it but it will continue to be partially covered by the taskbar. Only until I resize the window does the top bar of the window pop out from under the taskbar.&nbsp; The resizing box I am referring to is the square on the bottom right
 of every window that has 6 little triangles arranged in a triangle shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem only seems to come up if the taskbar is placed on the top of the screen instead of the default bottom.&nbsp; This problem is most annoying when the resizing box on the bottom right of the window has slipped down right off the bottom of the screen.&nbsp;
 In these instances my only choice to get the window back to a point that I can easily move it around is by moving the taskbar to some other part of the screen and then the window will pop back into place.&nbsp; Then I resize the window to be smaller. Then I can
 move the taskbar back to the top where I like it. I used to just click the edge of the taskbar and drag it upwards so it becomes a thin line with no visible content but this is no longer a feature in Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing that I am most displeased about that I was mentioning Win XP had is the fact that toolbars that used to be able to be moved around freely have become stuck on the taskbar.&nbsp; In XP you could take a toolbar, drag it to the desktop, and it would become
 a small window.&nbsp; Or you could drag the toolbar onto any of the four sides of the screen and it would create a bar similar to the taskbar containing the toolbar that you placed there.&nbsp; In XP I would have the Taskbar on the top of the screen and on the bottom
 I would place several toolbars to folders such as games and program files and other places I wanted to get to quickly and easily.&nbsp; And I would set this bottom bar to only pop up when you moved your mouse to the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Now the toolbars cannot
 be taken off the taskbar making them much less useful since they take up the same space that running programs take up.</p>
<p>That toolbar feature has been removed (or more aptly the toolbars have been restricted) and nothing has replaced this feature.&nbsp; So in my eyes this is a major failure.&nbsp; And it is annoying that something I enjoyed and made things easy in Windows ME and XP
 has been taken away.&nbsp; I find myself wishing XP had DX 10 and 11 so I could just stick with XP.</p>
<p>I have lived with the problem of the Taskbar occasionally covering the top parts of windows and really, compared to the toolbar issue, I don't mind continuing to live with it.&nbsp; The internet shortcut thing as well is annoying but doesn't cause any major issues.&nbsp;
 But the fact that I can no longer move the toolbars around and make a second bar besides the taskbar is really annoying and is very much putting me off of the Windows OS.&nbsp; I don't need perfection.&nbsp; But when features start getting taken away with nothing to
 replace what the features did, I really don't feel confident in the future of the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I only have only one toolbar, for games.&nbsp; Because adding more would take up too much space on the taskbar.&nbsp; I use a 3rd party application called "Object Dock" that I place on the bottom of the screen and I set it to pop up when I move the cursor
 over to the bottom of the screen but it doesn't at all replace the toolbars that XP had.&nbsp; If I want a list of say, all the files in program files, I can no longer just place a toobar of program files on the bottom and size it so there is only the title and
 a double arrow that you can click to browse through it.&nbsp; Now the best I can do is have a link to program files on the dock that I can click to open the Program Files window.&nbsp; But with toolbars you don't even need to open a single window.&nbsp; Because you can browse
 through files like browsing options on a menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I have stated everything clearly enough.&nbsp; If something specific needs more clarification I would be glad to try to explain more.&nbsp; I am fairly sure this is no easy fix.&nbsp; The toolbar features have obviously been removed and I don't expect them back.&nbsp;
 And I guess that is the saddest thing.</p>

<p><span>Hello, Celidor</span></p>
<p><span>The change to Steam shortcuts is not a result from any change in Windows, Steam creates shortcuts that use the steam:// links now. URL links work differently than a standard shortcut and does not explicitly point
 to a file and therefore you will not be able to open a file location. If desired, you should still be able to manually create a shortcut to the steam.exe and use the –applaunch &lt;id&gt; switch, using the link Umesh gave.</span></p>
<p><span>For future reference, there is the Open file location option when you right click most shortcuts, this eliminates the need to go to the file properties first.</span></p>
<p><span>With regards to resizing a window, the behavior you describe is to be expected, if you are trying to use a function that requires interaction from a mouse, and you are unable to do so for whatever reason, you
 will not be able to use that function.</span></p>
<p><span>That being said, if the program you are using explicitly requires you to use the bottom right corner to resize the window, that is a design flaw for that program. I am not aware of any recent program that behaves
 that way, so it may be worthwhile to get an updated version of the program.</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7, if the title bar of a window goes off the screen (or under the task bar in your case), Windows will automatically move it down.</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming you have hardware that supports it, you can make use of the DirectX 10 and 11 on Windows 7 which, in my opinion, adds some nice details in games that support it.</span></p>

    <title>RSAT 1.2 for Window 1607 &#39;The update is not applicable to your - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            RSAT 1.2 for Window 1607 &#39;The update is not applicable to your computer&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows v1607. &nbsp;As expected the RSAT tools didn't make the journey. &nbsp;I promptly downloaded the current version of RSAT which appears to have just been released yesterday and I am getting the error
<strong>'The update is not applicable to your computer'</strong> when I attempt to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the details from the RSAT download page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6a6e00b-ddac-4fe6-b3f6-92b203752b2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6a6e00b-ddac-4fe6-b3f6-92b203752b2a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that this was just updated yesterday. &nbsp;I see a lot of references to WindowsTH-KB2693643-x64.msu that was originally released for Windows v1607 but I can't see an option to download this older version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to get the RSAT installed?</p>

<p><span>Hi Carol97411,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you referring to the taskbar icons?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 the programs open fine when you open them from the Start Menu?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any change on this account prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get the “McAfee alert” in the notification area?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check to see if the following helps for the taskbar icons problem.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to pin these icons to the taskbar and check if it helps. Refer to the below mentioned link and check if it helps.</span></p>

 these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>

 once you are done.</span></p>

<p>hi carol, try this&nbsp;fix you need to check frist if you get this issue when you switch user's, just log off and then select switch user and see if the desktop is the same also try removing the game to begin with to see if that repairs the issue an easy way
 to do this is use system restore.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

hi carol,</p>
<p>please do not panic just yet. as windows 7 is very easy to locate and repair almost all issue's without the need to pay lots of money to people that could end up causing you more problems. also by doing simple checks/repairs yourself this will give you more
 confidence along with pc knowledge.</p>
<p>the first step i would suggest is to clean your os, go through your program list and uninstall all the programs you do not know/need. then perform a disk clean-up(do not delete any system restore points at this stage).</p>
<p>the seconde step is to use solution centre from microsoft to check/repair issue that you might have with your os like broken shortcuts/start-up issue's all of witch can be found here<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/fixit#tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/fixit#tab0</a>&nbsp;after
 you have completed the checks/repairs please then perform two more checks the first is a disk check and the second is a sfc scan. i have not included all of thease steps as i do not know your level of pc knowlegde and you do not want to fill an e-mail with
 steps that you might already know. however if you need thease step by step i would be pleased to post for you.</p>
<p>the&nbsp;thrid&nbsp;step i would very strongley recomend is that you run a full scan of your pc as it sounds like your pc might have been infected via your previous download, you will also need to perform a boot scan as well, if you need further assistance on what
 software to trust or how to perform virus checks please just reply and i will do my upmost to assist you.</p>
<p>the foruth step is to check on your firewall settings and click on the option allow a program through windows firwall and check to make sure that only the ones you know are allowed any relating to the game you installed remove.</p>
<p>please do not be put off by thease above steps as they are quite straight forward to complete and should be enough to repiar your os to full working order.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>yours</p>

hi carol,</p>
<p>have you completed all the other tasks i sent you? as some people are debating if this is a virus, so it is vital that you complete all of the steps first. windows fix-it will not repair this file for you. this is why i said to complete an sfc/scan and then
 complete a disk check. after this the only two option that i am aware of is first and safest is to install your windows7 disk from your desktop and do a update install,&nbsp;second is to install a program called ccleaner from piniform, this has a good registry
 repair option and includes secure delete, this program is free to install and use. here is a web link with more detail about this .exe and how to locate it<a href="http://www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_pages/22000-22999/22060_EgisUpdate.exe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_pages/22000-22999/22060_EgisUpdate.exe.htm</a>&nbsp;which
 might help you further if you just want to delete/disable this .exe my personal opion would be to just delet this&nbsp;(using secure gutman delete in ccleaner)&nbsp;as it seems to me a update monitor related to other game downloads which might be malious to test this<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/sandbox/eula.htm?scanner=default&amp;goback=%2Fsite%2Fen-us%2Fdefault.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/sandbox/eula.htm?scanner=default&amp;goback=%2Fsite%2Fen-us%2Fdefault.htm</a>&nbsp;click
 on this link it will take about 1/2 hours to complete and should be run at least once a month you might have to turn off your other anti-virus software first.</p>
<p>if you need any further info/assistance please ask.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>yours</p>

            Aaron...I don't get that "EgisUpdate.exe" error message anymore. For some reason it's gone and doesn't pop-up anymore. I still ONLY have the "START" button on my Launch Bar. No Internet Explorer,no Windows Exolorer, no Welcome Center, and no Media Center....they're
 All gone. Can't connect to internet. All this is on Administrator Account only, all my other accounts (users) seems fine and fast. Oh, and no info comes up when I right click on the "Start" button on Admin Acct. I figure I've got either a registry problem
 or my Windows Explorer (Launch Icon) Folder is gone. I've been told; or warned not to mess with the Registry and I'm to new to try to mess around and try to make a new folder right now. With my luck, I'd do more harm. I really appreciate all your help and
 suggestions, but I just don't have the confidence in myself. I probably thought it would be some easy fix; like a maintence click here to fix. Thank you again....BUT...if you have an easy fix, I'll take it! Carol

hi carol,</p>
<p>according to your issue and considering you do not feel that confident to perform other tasks to repiar this issue. the safest and one of the most easy ways for you to repiar your windows 7, is to perform a back up of all your files and reinstall&nbsp;windows
 as an upgrade (on top of your exsisting os) this will install missing/corrupt files and put everything back the way it should be, just remember to do a full virus scan first to make sure there is no infections. if you can not peform an upgrade (as you might
 have an oem version) then complete a clean install.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>yours</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated before hdd is<strong> not detectable in device manager nor in disk management</strong>. I am connecting hdd to laptop with usb 2.0 cable. I don't know what is hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>when i connected it for the first time on windows 10 laptop it worked and i could see it. i just changed the name of HDD and left it connected. after some time i was horrified to find it missing . laptop simply could not recognize it. i tried restart,
 checked device manager and disk management but could not find it anywhere. I uninstalled some items in device manager &nbsp;but still no success.</p>

            <p>Under device manager is there anything with a yellow triangle?<br />
<br />
Using command prompt&gt;diskpart is the drive seen?<br />
If so then you can use diskpart to clean the drive then it should be seen by disk management where you will be able to format it - choose MBR to have the drive compatible with previous Windows versions.</p>
<p>If there's something on the drive you wish to keep then plug it into another computer &amp; save the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Type in "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">DiskPart</span><span>"
 in command line.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Type in "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">list disk</span><span>"
 in command line to show all disks in this machine.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Use "select" to set the focus to the specified partition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For example "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">select disk 1</span><span>".&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Use "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">clean</span><span>"
 command to remove GPT disk from the current in-focus disk by zeroing sectors.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Go back to Disk Management, you can see GPT disk is "Not Initialized" now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Within Disk Management, right click on disk info, choose "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Initialize Disk</span><span>",
 You can see GPT disk is "Unallocated" now.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Right click on disk info, choose "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">New Partition…</span><span>", follow Partition
 Wizard and format it.</span></li></ol>

</p><p>I had the same issue with sound, when it was suddenly gone. &nbsp;Once my computer was done updating, the sound came back. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            why doesn&#39;t my skype show missed calls any more&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype on my windows 10 mobile and laptop running Windows 10. For about the past 3 weeks, Skype has stopped showing when I have missed calls.</p>
<p>I believe I have the most recent version, so I don't know why this functionality has stopped.</p>

            <p>That is a known bug and also affects surface with windows rt.</p>
<p>The march update should address it, but my feeling is it doesn't entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, other than asking you to make sure you have all updates, there's nothing more to do other than avoiding removing the keyboard when the machine is inactive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it does happen, I believe you can still log in by using the keyboard in the accessibility option or simply by reattaching the keyboard momentarily.</p>

            File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

            <div>Could be for one of the following reasons:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your computer's hardware has been changed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 7 was reinstalled on the same computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your Windows 7‌ product key was transferred from another computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The ‌Windows 7 product key that you're trying to use has already been used on the maximum number of computers that your license allows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you changed your hardware, reinstalled Windows 7, or transferred your product key, you'll need to activate Windows 7 using the automated telephone system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To activate using the telephone</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open Windows Activation by clicking the Start button , right-clicking Computer, clicking Properties, and then clicking Activate Windows now.‌</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Show me other ways to activate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Type your Windows 7 product key, and then click Next.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Use the automated phone system and then click Next. &nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click the location nearest to you from the drop-down list, and then click Next.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Call one of the available phone numbers listed. An automated system will guide you through the activation process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When prompted, enter the installation ID that's listed on your screen into your phone's keypad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Write down the confirmation ID that the phone system gives you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Under Step 3, type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided, click Next, and then follow the instructions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If activation isn't successful, stay on the line to be transferred to a product activation agent who can assist you.</div>
