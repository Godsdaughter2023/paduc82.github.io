    <title>I cannot select my System Restore or my System Reset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I cannot select my System Restore or my System Reset</h2>
                    Since I'm having problems accessing administrator controls, I have decided to take a system restore or use system reset. However in many attempts such as restarting my computer to get the restore or reset to work, nothing's happened when I choose on them
 both. Both options are out of action even though I can select the two to make my Windows computer to work better and access my Administrator controls back. But I can't seem to start it and it refuses to start. The only option I have left is my Advanced Startup,
 I wonder if this option may work or not, but I've stopped myself to ask you this to all if you can help me find a solution what's going on.

            Try performing a direct clean install.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hey Commodore.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can turn on System Restore on C drive as shown in this tutorial:    <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure 5-15% disk space (as much as you can afford) is configured so you have more points that last longer
<br />
<br />If Reset is not working you can do a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  CommodoreCrusher9000Trademark,
<br />
<br />Windows Reset works best when started form the Windows Recovery Environment, if that does not work, then your Recovery Image is Corrupt and your best option would be to re-install Windows 10, which would also repair that Recovery Image . ..
<br />
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset 
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Add-ProvisionedAppxPackage Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the successfull upgrade to Windows 10 I had some issues with the Mail and Calendar Apps.</p>
<p>To solve the problem I've searched the web and found the suggestion to run this command in powershell: "Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –like "*windowscommunicationsapps*"} | remove-appxprovisionedpackage –online" .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used this command and reinstalled both the apps and everything went fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem is that everytime I log with a new user or format the pc and reinstall windows, both Mail and Calendar are not installed and I need to download them from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add these back to the windows installation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>My monitor's resolution is 1366*768.But I play all games in 1024*768.....When I was on Windows 8.1 &amp; 7,Even though I use smaller resolutions,it automatically stretches to full screen.But now on Windows 10, After I switch to smaller resolution in full screen
 mode, it doesn't stretches to full screen,but it will crop the game screen......And doesn't occupy fullscreen.....but only occupies a portion of the screen......Is there any fix for this?</p>

            <p>I assume that your Intel graphics card is old enough that there is no official driver from Intel for it. Can you tell me the model&nbsp;of your intel HD graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, the driver that windows 10&nbsp;installs does not offer the Intel Graphics Center, where you can choose if you want fullscreen applications to take up the whole screen, or stay centered. If there is an official driver for your Intel HD, install it, open
 up the Intel Graphics Center, and there should be an option for taking up the whole screen on apps under the "Screen" menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope i was helpful.</p>

            <p>Yeah you do have a graphics chip, it just happens to be the Intel on-chip one.</p>
<p>Your Intel chipset is End-of-Life. That means that there is no longer official support for it on newer operating systems. When you installed Windows 10, that driver that was installed guarantees the mininum services, like video displaying correctly, but
 that's about it. There's no official driver from Intel for your chipset for Windows 10, so i guess you will not be able to do what you want. At least, not in an easy way.</p>

                    <p>I have tried all the suggestions shown in this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking-winpc/after-upgrading-to-windows-10-internet-only-works/6ee391e0-ab6c-4471-879c-83279eed21ee?page=5</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both resetting to original Win 10 and also refreshing with a recent Win 10, and both times nothing I have tried works.&nbsp; I don't feel inclined to buy support or a new copy of Win 10 (I don't have an OEM version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any new suggestions I could try?&nbsp; About the only good thing is that the program that I reset Win 10 for is working now and does not require direct internet access.&nbsp; However I don't like the idea of being restricted to Microsoft Edge - I may just
 use my phone for most things instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new help/suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Steven,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To have a better understanding of the issue, we will need more information. Kindly help us with the following information:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What happens when you try to access internet using other browser? </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What is the exact error message you are getting?</p>

</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, here are few things you can try:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Try turning off the Firewall. You can follow the steps provided in the article:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off</span></a><span>.

<p><span>Note: Windows Defender is on and actively helping to protect your PC by scanning for malware (malicious software), viruses, and security threats. Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan
 everything you download or run on your PC. Windows Update downloads updates for Windows Defender automatically to help keep your PC safe and protect it from threats. It is recommended that you turn it on once all the troubleshooting is done.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Try the steps mentioned in the article:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Fix network connection issues in Windows</span></a><span>. Even if you have already
 tried the steps, I would still request you to follow the steps mentioned in the above article.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We await your response.
</span></p>

<p>I am using Windows 10 Professional 64-bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, Edge and Windows Update are connecting successfully, so it is not an issue with my ISP or wired network connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other browsers, such as Brave browser which is based on Google Chrome, time out and don't load anything (Brave says: "Aw Snap!&nbsp; Something went wrong while displaying this webpage.".)&nbsp; When I try to install my anti-malware product my correct key (I've double
 and triple checked it) does not work because the anti-malware can't connect to the internet to validate the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the Reset my PC (which resets to default) and Freshen my PC (which resets to a recent clean version) gave the same error with no external programs installed, so it's not that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my internet connection was completely off then Edge and Windows Update would not work.&nbsp; Because they do and there was a blank slate the only possible explanation is that it is a software bug or misconfiguration on Windows 10's side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully been using both other browsers/programs and the same router successfully before I reset to a blank slate, so it's not an issue with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I've tried every possible solution in the forum thread I linked including turning off the firewall and restarting my computer and they haven't worked on my computer, so the solution must be something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Where is Dark Souls 2 Season Pass for the DLC&#63;&#63;  Mirosoft Scamming Loyal Fans&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There's supposed to be a season pass for Dark Souls 2 priced at $25.00 which guarantees 3 DLC packs. &nbsp;Instead Microsoft is advertising it only separately for $9.99. &nbsp;If these are individual packs it would cost $29.99. &nbsp;Both PlayStation and PC(Steam) have
 the season pass. &nbsp;Where is it? &nbsp;Is Microsoft trying to scam its loyal fans?</p>

<p>Doesn't look like the season pass is available on the Xbox 360. &nbsp;No scam. &nbsp;Just not able to purchase it. &nbsp;Your best bet would be to ask the people who make Dark Souls 2 why it isn't available.</p>

<p>The Season Pass wasn't offered on the 360 version of the game. &nbsp;I don't know why? &nbsp;If I had to guess, it would have something to do with Dark Souls 2 developers not in agreeance with MS for some reason.</p>

<p>Yes I know what a season pass is, you're not understanding my point here. &nbsp;It says get three new chapters, which 2 are not out yet. &nbsp;So that link is supposed to be linked to a season pass not just 1 DLC. &nbsp;Well I'll wait it out and if they do end up posting
 a season pass I'll be back in this thread, until then. &nbsp;Everyone else who buys it now, well yes you just got scammed.</p>

<p>Not the fact that it isn't offered, the fact that it was advertised to be released on this date and it is not. &nbsp;The face that other platforms such as PS3(UK) and PC(Steam) have already received the season pass. &nbsp;The part about getting scammed is people who
 have already purchased it unknowingly. &nbsp;It seems that Microsoft may be capitalizing on early purchasers unaware they could get a discounted price. &nbsp;Or those just eager to play it day 1 release.</p>
<p>Why would I wait for a GOTY edition when I already own the game? &nbsp;What would I benefit paying another $40-60 bucks for the same game but with new DLC?</p>
<p>Either way, I may be quick to be blaiming Microsoft this may be a scam run by Namco based on reading their forums. &nbsp;Or the fact that they've always favored Sony PlayStation over Microsofts Xbox, aka Bloodbourne exclusive to PS4.</p>

<p>A "scam" is when you buy/purchase something and you do not get what it was you thought you were purchasing. &nbsp;This isn't a scam. &nbsp;If you buy the first DLC, you get the first DLC. &nbsp;A season pass may never come to the Xbox 360, or it may down the line. &nbsp;It
 is your responsibility as a consumer to buy what you want to buy. &nbsp;As you've already stated, you can buy them individually, starting with the first DLC now, or you can wait and hope a season pass does get released.</p>

 </p></blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><p>I have all of the accounts signed in... If you take a look at the &nbsp;top left corner, you'll see the parent account's gamertag and icon. However my parents did got a new account, but all the accounts are in the same family as adults. Is there some verification needed? Also, I&nbsp;kept&nbsp;getting this 'Your content restrictions are in effect but cannot be changed before we connect to the service' message, but the console is connected to the internet, with a moderate nat type and my account has a month of xbox live left if I remembered correctly. Also i've tried on my old Xbox One and a new Xbox One S (Thought the old Xbox One was broken), nothing works...</p>

<br />
Are you seeing this error from installing by downloading the ISO or thru the Upgrade Assistant?<br />
Are you doing a dual boot, an upgrade or a clean install?<br />
<br />
Please provide more details and we will be glad to help. <br />

Thanks,<br />

<p>I am getting the error from the Upgrade Assistant and choosing the option to Install from the downloaded Upgrade Assistant.</p>
<p>I finally just made a copy of the ISO file to a DVD and re-booted with the DVD and did a Custom Install and everything worked well from that method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the method to install from the download does not work,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t get an added acct to work in Windows Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherrykatz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get an added acct to work in Windows Live</h2>
                    I just bought new Dell computer with windows 7 only to come to find out, no outlook express. bummed. but went ahead and set up the Windows LIve mail thing. Previously, in outlook express, i had two identites which I would switch back and forth to view
 the two different email accts. With this new one, they all go on the same mail page, which isn't that bad, concept wise. I was&nbsp; able to get one of the old outlook;/express accts imported and made it the default. When I added the other acct though, nothing
 from the old outlook express for that acct is showing, none of my inbox, none of my sent items, contacts etc. And it won't send from that acct either, keep getting error message. So I can't reply etc. I tried importing but won't import, tried the trouble shooter,
 no joy. In addition, the signature from this second acct, has the signature from the 1st acct showing. I'm confused and have spent the last 4 hours trying to resolve.
<br />
<br />
The only thing I am able to do with the added acct is get email in my inbox. (This acct, by the way, used to be the default acct for the old acct. Not sure if that matters) Help!<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for answering. I will try and be more clear about what the problem is. <br />
<br />
First to answer your questions: <br />
0) yes, I still have the old computer <br />
1) yes, the accounts use pop3 <br />
2) the message won't let me copy, but it says: <br />
"No message can be found in this folder or another applicatihn is running that has the required files open. Please select another folder or try closing applications that may have files open."<br />
3) not sure of WLMail build I have. I just got the computer two weeks ago. <br />
<br />
Here's the situation: <br />
1)After reading how to convert old Outlook Express to new Windows Live M, I opened the Live Mail acct using my main identity's (old outlook express default) email address and password. Then<br />
2) I "added an account", which is the other (not main) acct I had, again using the same email address and password I had before for this secondary acct. I'm not sure what happened after that, because it was so fast, but all of a sudden, all my folders, contact
 info etc showed up in Live. Great! This acct is now specified as the default acct, done automatically evidently from the Live Mail program.
<br />
3) then i went to add another acct (the one that was the primary acct before in outlook), entered the same email address and password (which was also the same email address and password I used to open the Live Mail acct #1 above). This time though, the only
 thing that got set up was a new inbox, sent etc, with none of my contacts,subfolders, inbox, sent, etc items from the old acct. (Fortunately, I was able to figure out the problem about sending from that acct in the new Live Mail acct, so that part is no longer
 an issue. It had to do with the server settings being wrong). <br />
4) Every time I try and import the messages using the import instructions in Live Mail, that error message shows up.
<br />
<br />
Does this make sense? <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi Ron, <br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to reply to me. I've been attempting to debug this problem to this day to no avail.
<br />
<br />
I followed your instructions, and it looked like the import was going to work, however, in the storage folder area, it got as far as having an "imported folder" tab and then when click that a "local folder" tab, but there's nothing in it!
<br />
<br />
The dbx files exist are here on my&nbsp; computer, all "read only" unchecked, and I'm not getting the error message. Just can't figure out where the actual folders are! "inbox, sent, and all subfolders.
<br />
<br />
any other ideas? <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Sherry <br />

<p>Seriously? Im getting sick of it. I was playing some matches today, and in one game some guy just kept betraying me, and others on our team. Is that teamwork? No. Im tired of trying my best to get my team a win and get kills, and have to look over my shoulder
 to make sure my teammate isnt going to betray me. And why is there no boot system for Living Dead? If there was I would have booted his spartan/elite 1/4 of the way through the game after he betrayed me twice. Does anyone play this game right anymore without
 glitching, betraying, modding, etc?</p>

<p>&nbsp;no I dont think its all kids though. I dont know what age this guy was, but it was the most annoying thing Ive ever encountred while playing Reach. Ive played against kids that are really good and play by the rules. I have no problem with age, just&nbsp;play
 by the rules.&nbsp;This is the exact reason why Im trying to expand my friends list for Reach, Im tired of playing random people who either A) dont play as a team, or B) play "immaturely"</p>

<p>Well, even though it may seem like it, Living Dead is not a team game, keep that in mind. Everyone has their own score, plan and goals. As far as betrayal goes from what I remember they had the boot option available, I am not sure if it is still in place
 though. If you betray someone intentionally like headshot with sniper they can boot immediatly other wise its considered accidental. Now if you shoot each other for a bit then you get betrayed, you will have a chance to boot him based on the registry basis
 :) I hope I helped. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I know its not team like the actual team playlists. I meant that spartans are on a team working to defend from zombies, and zombies are working to kill the spartans. Most of the games Ive played there was some teamwork involved, this one however was one
 of the first that didnt involve it. Ive been playing living dead becasue its fun, and something different. Ive also wanted practice using the shotgun too, since Ive hardly ever used it before. That and its good to boost your K/D ratio (I do care about it a
 little)</p>

STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Windows Logon Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000020 (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
You are not going to be getting a dump file, boot into any mode or sending any dump files (Sorry ZigZag3143), but do give that a try.<br />
<br />
Are you booting into the Recovery Console from a genuine bootable XP installation CD or a CD you made?<br />
<br />
When you boot into the XP Recovery Console, does the prompt say:<br />
<br />
C:\&gt;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
C:\Windows&gt;<br />
<br />
Sadly the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />

            I'll try for the missing/corrupt ws2_32.dll file.<br />
<br />
I can boot this system with either the xp_rec_cons or the hiren's boot CD.<br />
<br />
This is a home system that was home build about 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
It has the following configuration:<br />
<br />
ASUS motherboard a8nx5<br />
hd ide st3120213a<br />
cd/dvd combo-52x16c<br />
cpu amd athlon 64 processor 3800+ 24 mhx<br />
windows v5.1 (build 2600: sp3)<br />
<br />
This system has been running since 2007 flawlessly until 11/18/2012 and<br />
gets the blue screen failure during the login process.<br />
<br />
The xp_rec_cons boots to c:\windows<br />
<br />

            That is the only thing I have in my notes for that <b>0xc0000020 </b>error...&nbsp; there are probably some other XP files that will generate that, but those c000021a {Fatal System Error} messages can be elusive and sometimes you can get the exact same message
 that could be from several afflicted files.&nbsp; I have dozens of c000021a errors noted, but that is the only
<b>0xc0000020 </b>I have - and I have reproduced it by corrupting that file on purpose just to see what happens (or it would not be in my notes).<br />
<br />
Since you can get into the Recovery Console to the C:\windows prompts, I would have first copied the file from the dllcache folder or from the ServicePackFiles\i386 folder like:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\ws2_32.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
or&nbsp; (depending on how you installed SP3):<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\ws2_32.dll&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
But I looked at the one on Hiren's and it looks okay too (I did not actually try that one but it
<i>looks </i>the same).<br />
<br />
An XP Repair install would probably fix it, but you would need a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed SP and most people don't have that...&nbsp; and I have never done a Repair install in my life to fix any problem.<br />
<br />
Maybe looking around with Google on the World Wide Internet Computer Web will find some other ideas...<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>use hiren's to backup your files, and do a reinstall. One thread I read said Norton could cause this, and you did not say what your antivirus is.</p>

            I don't recall that there was any anti-virus software running on this system.&nbsp; The last time<br />
it booted successfully, I think,&nbsp; was Nov, 19, 2012.<br />
<br />
My son built this system in 2007 when he was working on his under graduate EI degree<br />
at the University of Michigan. I think the XP install was a UofM distribution.&nbsp; The recovery console CD<br />
is one I burned off the Internet.&nbsp; The XP install was scanned by MS when I got it a couple of years ago, and was validated by MS.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all...I'll keep looking.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 RDP app - no longer copy paste files</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Pro. I downloaded the Windows Desktop App (latest version) from the store. I have only one issue now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot copy a file (examples a small JPEG or Word doc) that resides on my Terminal Server 2012 Session and paste it to my local windows 10 desktop. I can copy and past words to and from but not files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I open the setting and look at the Connection settings I do have the Smart Card and Clipboard features marked as "ON". Also I cannot see a local share when in my TS Session, I am used to the old RDC and makeing these options available in the Local Resources,
 but do not see these similar options in the new RDP App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help will be greatly appriciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Loussier1,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are you getting any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are you installing this printer for the first time?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Did you have any other printer installed earlier?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make sure that all computers on the network are in the same workgroup. One way to do that is to change the workgroup names on your Windows&nbsp;Vista–based computers.
 For information about changing a workgroup name, see </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Join-or-create-a-workgroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Join or create a workgroup</span></a><span>.

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you don't know the name or network address (a location on the network) of the printer, contact the person who installed the printer on the network or a
 system administrator. If your computer is connected to a network domain, you might not have permission to use some printers and the printers will not be displayed. To obtain permission, contact a system administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are adding a printer that is plugged into another computer on the network and shared for other people to use, make sure that the computer where the
 printer is plugged in is turned on. You can also contact the computer owner to make sure that the computer is connected to the network or to see if the name of the printer has changed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Disable antivirus and firewall temporarily to check if the printer is getting detected.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to enable them back.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the printer is still not getting detected, make use of the windows cleanup utility to remove the existing printer software (if any) and then attempt
 to install the printer.</span></span></p>

<h2>            What&#39;s the single most important feature missing from the November release of Photos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Edit: &nbsp;Good news (but some bad)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">-&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/new-photos-app-discussion/d81a81b5-7155-4d17-b695-a6049dd8e8f3?page=7">here's</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;how
 Microsoft is working to restore at least some of the deleted edit tools, effectively killing this thread. &nbsp;But so far there's no sign of a return of wheel navigation, so use&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/getting-the-mouse-scroll-wheel-to-navigate-as-well/99971536-ff59-4b6a-897a-a1fa7d92fee6">this</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;link
 if you'd like to support that seemingly overlooked feature. &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It describes a simple method that not only fully supports both Zoom and Navigation but mostly eliminates the need for the new Navigation
 Pane.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a discussion to help MS prioritize the community's complaints about the new Photos version released in November. &nbsp;Feel free to mention more than one feature but please indicate which one is most important to you and why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me the biggest loss is the disappearance of the controls for Shadows and Highlights (I noticed that's two things but one isn't much help without the other). &nbsp;I remember being able to handle overexposed photos fairly well with them, but without them it
 seems hopeless. &nbsp;If anyone has access to both versions it would be nice to see a comparison of what can be accomplished. &nbsp;The best I can do is a combination of Enhance, Light, Clarity and Color (filters don't help). &nbsp;The results seem a lot worse than before
 but am I just imagining my prior successes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how well are underexposed images handled without them?</p>
<p><br />

            I assume you mean Selective Focus - an interesting choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it valuable to you because your customers expected that treatment?&nbsp; If&nbsp;we want MS to restore a feature we have&nbsp;to make it clear why it was more valuable than they thought.

            The ability to adjust shading, highlight and contrast are all equally important. funnily &nbsp;enough those are the three tools removed when the new update took effect. Without them the app is not even half as powerful as it used to be.

            <p>Contrast is unchanged except for the name - it's now Clarity. &nbsp;But it still uses a fixed proportion of shadows and highlights. &nbsp;Its behavior is very good but doesn't help much for overexposed or underexposed images.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Technically Contrast/Clarity is likely the most disposable since its behavior can always be accomplished with Shadows and Highlights. &nbsp;But no one wants to have to manually adjust contrast that way. &nbsp;So you're right - we really do need all three. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason I found the old Photos so useful was because I wasn't using it to optimise photos, I was using it to manipulate my computer aided graphic designs. Having the functionality to adjust the contrast, shading and highlight made the difference between
 a good image or a GREAT image. The ability to see immediately what effect taking shading, highlight or contrast up or down made using Photos so easy a child could do it. It WAS one of the most simple yet powerful apps I have ever used... not any more... I
 am sure the updated version is good for manipulating photos but the old version was BRILLIANT for manipulating ALL images!!!</p>

            <p>That's probably a usage that MS didn't consider; it's likely a small group but&nbsp;one for which the two functions were very important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone that keeps their original copies or still has the old program&nbsp;help us out here?&nbsp; All we need is an original image and your best repair job using Shadows and Highlights.&nbsp;&nbsp;An image like Gerard has suggested would be great but feel free to use
 any&nbsp;under/overexposed photo or ask me to provide one. &nbsp;One of us can then&nbsp;try to do the same fix&nbsp;without the deleted tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main question I have is whether new technology has all but&nbsp;eliminated exposure problems.&nbsp; Are they now a thing of the past for most of us?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so,&nbsp;that's probably&nbsp;why MS deleted the two tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I'm surprised&nbsp;how few mention&nbsp;no longer being able to navigate with the mouse wheel.&nbsp; Previously&nbsp;you needed to hold &lt;ctrl&gt; down to zoom with the wheel; now you don't but the &lt;ctrl&gt; function was not reassigned to navigation.&nbsp; That's just as well
 since&nbsp;infrequent zoomers&nbsp;don't really want that anyway.&nbsp; In the Feedback Hub, take a look at "I don't need two ways to zoom with my mouse".&nbsp; It suggests a simple configuration entry that gives us the best of both worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know MS hates clutter so&nbsp;we may
 end up having to hold down &lt;ctrl&gt;, but&nbsp;just let us navigate with the wheel one way or the other.</p>

            <p>After doing some research to try to answer my own question, there's no doubt there are far fewer exposure problems than a decade ago. &nbsp;But from what I've read, people often overlook chances to use the Shadows and Highlights controls even in properly exposed
 shots (see above). &nbsp;I wonder if MS similarly underestimated their potential? &nbsp;But we can't expect them to do the research if we can't even be bothered to clearly show them what was lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft feels their newly variable enhancement feature is good enough to do away with Shadows/Highlights. &nbsp;The old one often got one or both of those settings completely wrong but now we can control the amount of change. &nbsp;The only problem is how
 the adjustment bar handles multiple attributes. &nbsp;For instance, assume it changed Shadows and Highlights but got the former very wrong. &nbsp;When you move the bar to adjust the Shadows, Highlights will change as well. &nbsp;And if it changed three or four attributes
 we certainly wouldn't want to adjust them all equally. &nbsp;Does the program "know" that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pictures, anyone? &nbsp;There must be someone out there who saves the originals.</p>

            Color boost was really important because it could help you boost a specific color without oversaturating the whole picture. Let's say you have a picture of fall colors. Color boost enabled you to boost the reds and oranges without necessarily boosting
 the blue sky or green grass. Now we just have to saturate all the colors. So if you want to boost the fall colors you now have an over-saturated blue sky. The old color boost function was a great feature and the idiots at Microsoft got rid of it for no reason.
 I guess they figured Instagram-using millennials were just too stupid to use it?

            <p>If MS wanted to argue, it&nbsp;would reply that&nbsp;you can&nbsp;still boost&nbsp;individual colors with the new filters and Warmth.&nbsp; They would want to see what Color Boost could do that could not be done with filters.</p>

            <p>I am lost without Selective Focus, Temperature/Warmth, Highlights and Shadows, and I loved the Color Boost as well.
</p>
<p>Taking pictures of a toddler I often have a busy background and the ability to use Selective Focus can change a picture from a candid living room shot to a professional looking picture. Cats often have litter in the background or food on the floor, and Selective
 Focus can make those things not visible when making adds to sell kittens. I can blur the foreground and background, making my picture look more professional and higher quality. Highlights and Shadows gives me the ability to bring more light on my son's face,
 while making the background darker and less busy.</p>
<p>Babies with light skin are often washed out by the light. Having warmth gives the ability to bring skin tone back to the correct color. Taking pictures of cats, light affects the color of their coat and temperature gives me control to make the color look
 as it actually is instead of how the lighting changes it. </p>
<p>Color boost was great for making the sky more blue and my niece's blue eyes pop. I could bring more purple to a field of flowers while leaving my son still normal color. I could make the tractor in the pasture really really red while sitting in light green
 grass with white daisys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My pictures used to go from plain and simple to amazing and professional. Maybe Microsoft cant give us back the old program (or maybe they can?) but can they do another update and add back the things they took away? Soo many people would be happy and I do
 not see how adding them back would upset anyone. I think users wouldnt even mind if we didnt get the wheels back (I really liked them) as long as we had the options back. I really hope Microsoft is reading all of these threads and making some sort of plan
 to make it better. &nbsp;Makes me nervous when they went ahead and removed Warmth/Temperature 3 days ago. Now I have to edit my photos on another program to adjust color and temperature, and then open them in Photos again to get the Vignette and Contrast and I
 have no way to do Selective Focus because I cant even find something like that on another program. Please hear us Microsoft! And thanks soo much to Tom Martin for all the communications on these threads! If only you were MS!</p>

    <title>Cannot activate Windows 10 Enterprise E3 &#40;local only&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miguel alfaiate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate Windows 10 Enterprise E3 &#40;local only&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 subscription, and I am trying to install / activate it in a brand new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The license was assigned to my administrator user (admin @ ….onmicrosoft.com) by my provider, and I assigned it to a use created from within my admin panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging in with that user in the office 365 portal, I can see the license in the subscriptions page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went here and created a bootable usb disk with Windows 10:&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/pt-pt/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing, I chose Windows 10 pro as the version, and chose install for work / company, added my account username and password (the same one the Windows 10 license was assigned to) and proceeded with the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I finally get to Windows, I see an error in the activation screen from system settings saying that Windows was unable to activate. I have tried troubleshooting to no avail, I have logged in with this user through the browser on the new pc and I can
 see the license there, but I see no way of adding / assigning the license to the existing installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing, or what should I be doing?</p>

<p>Hi Miguel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 E3 subscription does not provides activation benefits. It only provides Windows 10 Enterprise upgrade benefits provided 2 prerequisites are fulfilled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Base OS has to be Windows 10 Pro (activated copy of Windows)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Devices should be connected to Azure AD through Azure AD Join or Hybrid Azure AD &amp; the licensed user should sign in to Windows usung Work or School account.</p>

<p>Hello Rahul.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a mistake from my distributor, which sold me a license for something that would never work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case the question should be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some workstations that do not have a windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am migrating to windows, and would like to purchase subscription based licenses for them, for Windows 10 Pro (at least since I need some pro features).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a license that allows me to install windows on non windows machines, and pay a monthly or yearly fee for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? What kind of licensing should I be using? Should I be using volume licensing? Where should I get such licenses from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello Miguel,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Windows Client Volume License is always an upgrade license. So in your case you will have to purchase Windows 10 Pro FPP (Retail) keys from MS Store (online or physical store).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Also to add, you may finds cheaper deals online selling Windows 10 System Builder licences. My advise: Do not go for it.</span></p>

    <title>Search function not working in any folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonhansson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search function not working in any folder</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed a week ago or something like that when I was gonna search for a picture in one of my folders that the search function wasn't working as intended. I didn't think much of it then and decided to just find the picture by scrolling through a bit since
 I figured that it was a temporary problem that would get fixed when I restarted or something of the sort. It turns out now that even after restarting, updating windows, searching for viruses and trying every single folder option I can find that it still doesn't
 work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried creating a new account on my computer and logged in on that and that works perfectly fine, I can search in any folder and find just what im searching for but on my main account I use on my computer whenever I search for something nothing happens,
 I type in a word in the search bar but nothing happens, it's like I haven't even typed anything in. All of the images remain to be shown.</p>
<p>Would really appreciate some help with this since I can't for the life of it figure it out on my own and it can be a bit frustrating trying to find specific pictures in a folder with over a thousand of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I forgot to say that it's also not possible to open a picture then use the arrows on your keyboard to change to next picture or to a picture before it. There also used to be arrows on the picture itself, on the leftmost and rightmost side but those
 are also gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any answers I can get, thanks.</p>
<p>/Simon<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand the difficulties you are facing with the PC, as the search indexing is not working this user account. We appreciate your effort in troubleshooting
 the issue and providing us the detailed information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, we would suggest you to perform these methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> To confirm whether Search service is running or not, you need
 to perform these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press<strong> WIN + R</strong> keyboard shortcut to launch the
<strong>Run Command dialog</strong> box. Here type <strong>service.msc</strong>&nbsp;and click
<strong>OK</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Look for service named as
<strong>Windows Search </strong>and check if it is running.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Also, double click on the
<strong>Windows Search </strong>entry to see the service properties. Here make sure that
<strong>Startup type </strong>is set to<strong>&nbsp;Automatic or Automatic delayed.</strong></span></p>
</li><li><span>Restart the PC and check.</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span><span>Rebuild the Search Index in Windows 10</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Launch the <strong>
Indexing Options</strong>. For that, simply type Indexing Options in Windows 10 Start menu search bar and when you see it in the results, click to open it.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the Indexing Options window, click on the “<strong>Advanced</strong>” button which is available at the bottom.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In this window, under
<strong>Index Settings tab</strong>, look for <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> section, under it, you will see
<strong>rebuilt</strong> button. You need to click on that Rebuild button.</span></p>
</li><li><span>Click on the
<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;button to continue the process.</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Note: Its will take few hours to complete the rebuilding the index. So don’t expect instant results. But once it is complete, you should not face any Windows 10 Search Issues.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Use Default Search Troubleshooter to Fix the Windows Search</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Launch the Control Panel and in the Control Panel window, switch view category to
<strong>small icons</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>From the list of Settings look for
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click to open it.</span></p>
</li><li>

<span>In the Troubleshooting window, on the left pane, click on
<strong>View all</strong> link.</span></p>
</li><li>

<span>Look for <strong>
Search and Indexing</strong> and click to launch it.</span></p>

<span>When you launch the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter, a new window will appear click

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Windows search and it says that it is running and it is set to automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried rebuilding the index 2 days ago, it didn't take a few hours as you mentioned, it only took approximately 20 minutes but it didn't fix the problem. so I might have not done it the correct way? I think I did though since I followed a guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the troubleshooter for search and indexing I do find a problem.</p>
<p>This problem says "Incorrect permissions for Windows Search-catalogs"</p>
<p>I have tried opening up the services.msc and checked if there is anything I can change in there but I can't find anything that helps me change the permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read something that incorrect permissions for windows search might make it so that the search doesn't have access to the indexing files and therefore it can't find anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to change these permissions? I can't find a way to change them myself after looking for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached two pictures below that show the windows search running and the error that I get from troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
ntoskrnl.exe is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
<p>Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />

there may well be other Bug_Check codes.)<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death'
<br />
crashes, and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />

MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second
<br />
or so of the time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />

<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details<br />
of all application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the<br />
.wer files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system<br />
every time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these
<br />
issues. Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows
<br />
Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused
<br />
by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)
<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
