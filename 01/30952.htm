<p>Go Settings, Devices, Mouse &amp; touchpad and Select your primary button.&nbsp; Move it from Left to Right then Back to Left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also have you cleaned your mouse lately?&nbsp; Blow out the dust.&nbsp; I get canned air at Costco and use it for blowing out the dust in my computers and track balls.&nbsp; It is in the computer area.&nbsp; Cheaper there than at places like Staples or other computer stores
 if you buy in bulk.</p>

<p><em>"USA only thing"</em></p>
<p>Most likely the big US tech companies are giving worldwide data, I mean, if you are precluded from doing this against your own people, why wouldn't you do it people that are not covered. &nbsp; If they are giving backend access, who knows what data has been given,
 you assume all of it. &nbsp; Don't use US companies to hold your data or to use their services without encryption. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait till these companies are sued in other countries over this, these other countries are going to fine them into the ground. &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean some of this these executives could be charged with crimes especially in other countries. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That is a question that European countries would really like the answer to. Like Mako said, they could be looking at anyone. They are definitely getting information on foreign nationals within the U.S.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I honestly wouldn't worry about it, though. Learn how to protect your privacy and keep your nose clean. Yes, it is wrong and possibly illegal for them to do it, but human eyes will probably never see your personal information because you're not that important.
 We can only hope that it will be put to a stop, but while it is around I am sure they are looking for much more interesting people than you or I, even if it is our own journalists, businessmen and politicians for the purpose of blackmail.</p>

<p>I have seen someone say they are &nbsp;ok with surveillance because it stops terrorist attacks...and I can understand letting the fear in you allow you to give up some rights....for the sake of safety. &nbsp;I served in the military and I know there are zealots in
 the world...there are evil people in the world. &nbsp;There is a huge push in the media to sensationalize things that happen. &nbsp;The truth is you are more likely to die from many other things before a "terrorist attack" &nbsp;Hell..more people die from car accidents a
 year than a lot of things.....</p>

<p>I understand a lot of this is done with good intentions right now. &nbsp;I just fear the day someone utilizes it for less than honorable intentions. &nbsp;Anytime you wonder why the govt would abuse its power. Just remember the govt is made up of people....people
 can be corrupted...people can seek power....And that is the weakest link in any govt....humans.... &nbsp;Just look up Hoover.... &nbsp;Absolute power and all.</p>

<p>Agreed, Silent. I certainly don't think that it's a good idea, but I also don't think that they are ever going to waste their time with the surveillance of the average console player.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm worried about them catching dirt on people of influence and using it as political leverage. That is far worse to me than if they read my emails or watch me play games in my underwear. So while it is bad and it will affect all of us, I don't think very
 many people have to worry about being spied on themselves.</p>

<p>Anyway, none of that is really in line with the purpose of these forums. </p>

<p>Yeah I'm in Europe too Pezza so it was all new to me also. Of course I new that there's plenty of spying going down all over the place for years! But I guess a lot of those in the US simply didn't realise. Hence its suddenly blown up over there. Still, out
 of principle if I was buying the next gen.. X1.. I would still pop my Ethernet cable out the back when not in use.

<p>Judging by the amount of attention seekers posting crap up on youtube..I can see a lot of fame chasers buying this so they'll at least no they've got a captive audience. That poor NSA guy.. You'll hear they found him hanging from the ceiling by the time

<p>And that won't do any good. &nbsp;What do you think the reason for the once a day internet connection is? &nbsp;Do people really buy into the BS line of needing to make sure that they still really own the DRM to a game that they paid for, even if the disc is in the
 XBone? &nbsp;The DRM is just a front to make sure that the XBone and Kinect are hooked up to the MS servers daily. &nbsp;Only the truly naive aren't skeptical about the real purpose of the mandatory Kinect and once a day internet connectivity.</p>

<h2>            My internet connection drops every few minutes, but my network connection is fine</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new ISP. Every device connected to it wirelessly works fine with great speeds, but my computer (windows 7) cannot keep an internet connection for more than 5 minutes. When I lose the internet connection, the network connection is always
 fine and when I try troubleshooting it either says that the default gateway is not available, my network adapter has been reset, or that the router is unreachable. However, when I disconnect and reconnect, I get another few minutes of internet. I have tried
 what I could find on the internet such as restoring from a backup, updating drivers, changing router settings ( which were already on the correct things so I left them alone), etc.</p>
<p>this problem is VERY frustrating, and i basically can't use my computer as almost everything I do requires internet! I hope somebody has an answer for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>

    <title>Surface Book Dock monitors go blank every half minute or so - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgrahamxn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Dock monitors go blank every half minute or so</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new surface book and dock, Windows 10 is up to date. I have two DELL 30" monitors that are hooked up through the dock. Every 30 seconds to a minute the external monitors will randomly go black, but not at the same time and then turn back on
 after a little while. Here is what I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I plug one of the monitors directly into the surface book it works fine. If I try the other one it works as well.</p>
<p>1) I have a similar setup at work and it functions fine. Although the monitors I have at home are a little older.</p>
<p>2) I brought the dock home that is working on my other system and it has the same problem.</p>
<p>3) I switched out the display port cables and that didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>4) I rebooted, didn't help.</p>
<p>5) I tried one monitor at a time and it still has the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only the external monitors, the monitor on the surface book works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can tell it has to do with these particular monitors and the dock. The dock doesn't seem to be the problem and neither are the monitors. But put them together and it isn't usable. I have been on the phone with support twice and they seem to be
 stumped as well.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have done quite a thorough job of troubleshooting already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you had a chance to try your current home setup with different monitors?&nbsp; As you say, this is the only thing that doesn't seem to work as desired with your current topology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only thing that is different between my work configuration and the one at home are the dock and the monitors. Since I took the dock from work home I kept everything consistent except for the monitors. It works with the monitors at work but not at home.
 So based on this I believe I have tried what you are asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be willing to believe that the monitors were the problem if they didn't work directly plugged into the Surface Book. The problem only occurs when the monitors are plugged into the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would consider using the Surface Book with one monitor plugged directly into the computer but it is designed so that when the power adapter or dock are connected there isn't room for the display port cable to plug in. I can't always run on battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general I really like the Surface Book, that makes it more important that I get this resolved. I would appreciate any help I can get on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my message.</p>

            <p>Three options.</p>
<p>1: Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2: Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>3: IE New Window Maximizer (For IE only).<br />

<h2>            Halo&#58; MCC -- Completed all campaigns on Legendary but achievements still locked</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone, I've gone through the unlocking methods described before on the official forums such as removing and adding your account back but no luck. I have completed all campaigns on MCC. Spent all last week doing so. It shows
 up on my actual game screen as all missions being completed on Legendary. However, I have not received credit for it via achievements. I'm pretty bummed about it since it's the last thing I need to complete 100% customization on Halo 5 for that Helioskrill
 armor :( Any help or am I SOL and I need to redo the campaigns?</p>

            Hi zairiesalleh
<br />
<br />As soon as you boot your PC:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Choose the processes tab and click on the Processor column header so that arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your processor is at 100%, what are the top 5 processes at that time?

<h2>            I cannot uninstall Windows Update KB2976978</h2>
                    <p>I never wanted or asked for this Windows Update (KB2976978), it might have been a silent install some time ago. I am running Windows 8.1 Pro. I tried to uninstall it at the command line, but I get an error message in a window: "Windows Update Standalone
 Installer: &nbsp;Update for Microsoft Windows (KB2976978) is required by your computer and cannot be uninstalled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Microsoft's Support site about KB2976978:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>This update performs diagnostics on the Windows systems that participate in the Windows Customer
 Experience Improvement Program. The diagnostics evaluate compatibility on the Windows ecosystem and help Microsoft to ensure application and device compatibility for all updates to Windows. There is no GWX or upgrade functionality contained in this update."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>reference:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2976978</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there must be some way to remove this specific update. I also tried using the&nbsp;Installed Updates Window from the Start button, but there is NO way to right-click on the update and select "Uninstall". Of course, there are other updates where I can select
 "uninstall", but just not for KB2976978.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to dig into the Registry to remove it? Or is there other magical ways? I want to remove any "<span>Windows
 Customer Experience Improvement Program" related updates from my computer. Weekly, I inspect and individually install updates. But, I try my best to weed out the (telemetry) updates.</span></p>

<p>No, I got the Symantec Endpoint from the Army mil website. I did not do anything with Home Use program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never downloaded nor run any Norton or McAfee tools. Like I said, the first thing I did when I received my laptop was to (turn off wifi) uninstall Norton/McAfee stuff, reboot and install Symantec Endpoint. I have been doing this for every new computer
 I get for the past 10 years, absolutely no issues.</p>

            <p>Well, you might try downloading/running the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> (followed by a reboot) and then&nbsp;the
<strong><a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a></strong> (followed by another reboot), running the Windows Update troubleshooter (followed by yet another reboot) - and then testing. If the "leftovers"
 were causing the problem, you should see "snappier" performance with every reboot over the next day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Symantec tells us that running the Norton Removal Tool will not affect any Symantec applications. If you'd purchased Symantec Endpoint Protection, you could double-check with Symantec Support. Ditto if you're still active military or a civilian employee
 of the military.</li></ul>

<p>Firstly, welcome to the xbox support forums and going back to your question...</p>
<p>All you got to do is go to settings, memory and gamer profiles. The corrupted one should be marked wth a caution sign.</p>
<p>MAKE SURE YOU'RE SIGNED IN TO LIVE!</p>
<p>Next, delete the profile that's corruped. Be sure to choose \"Profile Only\", not \"Profiles and items\" or your saves wll get deleted.</p>
<p>Then, recover your profile fom the main Xbox360 Dashboard, not Xbox360 Guide.</p>
<p>Lastly, enter your details, recover and pray that you account is still in one piece.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure you delete all corrupted content and then instead of downloading the profile in each console over and over again, just keep your own profile on your console and use a USB Flash Drive to download the profile onto there and use it
 at your boyfriends house. That should solve the issue with multiple corrupted profiles.</p>

                    <p>So I'm getting divorced and my now ex husband and i have always shared one Xbox account attached to my Microsoft account, no issues. But I game very little and he wants to keep all his progress and saved data and downloaded games and everything. He wants to keep the Xbox Live account we've been using, but change it into his email. But doing that changes MY Microsoft account that i alsio use for work. Is there any way around this? To let HIM keep the Xbox Account without ME loosing MY Microsoft Account? Thanks!</p>

 freezes, the screen turns white and the window closes. Upon re-loading the game I do&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span>see the "Global Resources Reset" message at the top of the screen which could be of some significance.</p>
<br />
<p>I played Minecraft Bedrock Win10 a lot last year on realms, and didnt experience any of these problems. The game is becoming almost unplayable at this point.</p>
<br />
<p>I would really appreciate any info on this, or even to know if others are experiencing the same thing</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey there <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fd4af6dd-2739-4042-8f71-bd4b9b35a4c9" title="PhantomC11">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out&nbsp;to the community&nbsp;for advice on what to do in this situation.
</p>
<p>I can understand how a game crashing like this could be distressing. </p>
<p>If you haven't yet, I suggest trying the troubleshooting steps outlined in our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-gameplay-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot gameplay issues on Windows 10 </a>support article&nbsp;and see if that positively affects the situation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know if that helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Hi, wow I'm sorry to hear it's crashing so much. Up to 15 times per hour, yikes lol. &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a friend that had a similar issue on W10 a little while back and he said he had to uninstall the whole game and reinstall it, and then it worked. Have you tried to do a complete game uninstall/reinstall? If nothing else is working prior to that, I
 would give it a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! I hope this might fix it for you. </p>

<p>First one is easy</p>
<p>Your account region must reflect your actual region this must be done on this website under my account and change my region</p>
<p>If it's the 2nd one you must have a payment option on file as per the requirements of xbox 360 live for Web purchases and xbox one doesn't count as a xbox 360 only using the webportal to do so</p>
<p>If it's third well you have to be 18 in order to download certain content and no xbox one parental permissions dont apply
</p>
<p>Either use a xbox 360 with parental permissions or have an parental account with gold make the purchase

            <p>Hello Nadine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are unsure whether you have used the keyboard combination<strong> ctrl + z</strong> or
<strong>ctrl + x </strong>during a cut paste operation from an external device to your Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that, undo command will revert all the changes made to the Windows. However, that would&nbsp;require some extra numbers&nbsp;of
<strong>ctrl + z</strong>, to undo all the previous procedures/operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since you have done the cut-paste individually for all the image folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So from a performance view point, Windows did&nbsp;execute the commands correctly till the point you chose to use the undo shortcut. So, I suspect that you might have used undo command in this case. And, a file if deleted as a part of undoing changes to Windows,
 wont be moved to the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the computer is switched on, you can still use the <strong>ctrl +&nbsp;y</strong> keyboard shortcut to&nbsp;bring back the changes made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information is helpful.</p>
        </p>

<h3> michelle5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rocketfish Wireless Keyboard &#38; Mouse</h2>
                    I had an oler laptop and my cordless keyboard and mouse installed and worked easily.&nbsp; I just purchased a new laptop with Windows Vista and cannot get this to work.&nbsp; I have tried the updates and they just seem to disappear.&nbsp; Then I end up with the installation&nbsp;CD
 open on my desktop and when I try to click on install- it just keeps on sitting with a message at the bottom of my lower bar saying 'Install not Responding'.&nbsp; I have tried to contact Rocketfish people to take remote control of my computer to help me with this
 but have not heard back yet/&nbsp; is there someone out there who can help me??&nbsp; I now have the picture of the CHOICES like INSTALL, OPEN ADOBE PROGRAM, EXIT &amp; READ USERS MANUAL all displayed as if "SHADED' on my desktop and the timer going non stop.&nbsp; I've tried
 taking the \CD out, turnng on and off the computer, booting the computer and nothing will change!&nbsp; so now I have an even more frustrating circumstances for someone with my VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE workings of computers!!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT?<br />

            Hi Michelle5, <br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista support forum,<br />
<br />
I think you can download the drivers from Rocket Fish and install it on your computer.&nbsp; Make sure you download the correct version for your model and operating system.&nbsp; There isn't much eles we can do since hardware is not support in this forum.&nbsp; I would suggest
 wait for Rocket Fish's support.&nbsp; They would know more about their hardware than us.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,

<span>Hi RomeoSTAVAR,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Most programs created for earlier versions of Windows also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't work correctly,
 you can try changing the compatibility settings for the program, either by using the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter or manually choosing compatibility settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer: </span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></b></p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If issue persists, I would suggest you to post this query in Citrix forum community, and check for the responses.</span></p>

<h2>            Grayed out picture thumbnail</h2>
                    <p>I have been editing photos with Google Picasa, which is also my viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Explorer, my folders so far today have been fine - thumbnails crisp and brilliant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my current folder has all greyed out thumbnails. &nbsp;Double-clicking opens (in Picasa) a brilliant photo, so it's lost no data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot cursor-arrow through the folder (look at the next photo without closing the first and double clicking the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another folder where half of the pictures have this behavior, and the other half crisp brilliant thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make them all that way? &nbsp;I understand the other issue is one for Picasa.</p>

<h3> drc&#43;ee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 hangs, explorer.exe crashes, &#91;program not responding&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Avast antivirus blocked an adware threat attached to a popup. When it was removed it appeared to&nbsp; damage something.</p>
<p>The first issue encountered since detection &amp; removal of the adware was persistent
<strong>explorer.exe errors</strong> appearing randomly and windows explorer would have to restart itself. The computer itself did not require a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem changed itself, such that Windows Media Player will often freeze when opening and can make the computer largely unresponsive/very slow. Actually, every program freezes randomly and says "[not responding]".<br />
</p>
<p>I have done a boot time scan with Avast and several full scans with Spybot: Search and Destroy.
</p>
<p>No threats were found with updated definitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is appreciated on this subject.</p>

<p>One of the errors received with Windows Media Player was " server execution failed ". The rest of the time it freezes on startup but will begin to work if left for 5-10 minutes. Problem
 occurs with any and all files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Uninstalled and reinstalled Windows Media Player, restarted after each uninstall and install stage.</p>
<p>2) Uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox browser twice, restarted.3) Ran cmd: sfc/scannow several times, no errors found, restarted each time.4) Disk Defragmenter does not function; Analyze
 always begins at 57% and ceases a few minutes later as though I never clicked it. Defragment button does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found these suggestions online and tried them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Disabled Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service6) Registered regsvr32 jscript.dll and regsvr32 vbscript.dll successfully.7) Added administrator group to the local service; net
 localgroup “Administrators” “NT Authority\Local Service” /add successfully</p>
<p>8) Disabled tracking service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WMP started working fine for hours, then froze again when the program was opened.</p>

<p>Update Jan 3 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not resolved. </p>
<p>The freezing or hanging behavior affects every program on the computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition the the previous behavior I also noticed that Windows Media Player 12 is not filling the timeline at the bottom of the player correctly. When music or video finishes, the timeline ends at about 3/4 the way across the timeline. The files play
 completely (when the player works), but the timeline is not scaled to fit properly. Maybe someone out there will read this and recognize the cause.</p>

<p>I would say that this would a perfect reason to use the <strong>Restore Point</strong> option, assuming you have Automatic Restore Points.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolling back to a previous Restore Point should allow you to go back a week or two to the last update, or even the last time you installed an app. It won't affect any files or doc.s as this is just dealing with the OS. If the nearest Restore Point is right
 at the time you started getting problems, check the Choose a different restore point option. You should have at least two and possibly more like six to choose from. This is much less drastic than re-installing Windows and just brings the system back before
 you had problems.<br />
<br />
You can type in <strong>Restore Point </strong>in the Cortana Search box to take you there. It will default to<em> Create a Restore Point</em>, but on the same panel is the
<strong>System Restore</strong> button. Click that and choose the most appropriate date; ideally at least 3-5 days before you had any malware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: The suggestions you got* for solving this honestly should not be needed and may make things worse. A Restore Point will take care of that though, so don't bother undoing it manually. Either way, those things are probably not why you are having issues;
 it's clearly related to the malware. I don't<em> think </em>Avast itself damaged the system, but it may not have been able to properly fix what happened.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>I created a restore point last summer and it's not listed in system restore. Recovery (drive (D:) is 20GB in size. I find it perplexing there's no backup going back to December, unless there is another way to go back that far or even further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to download a boot copy of Windows 7 from Microsoft and it said there was a problem with my product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever happened did it all.</p>

<h2>            Unexpected Store Exception since upgrade to Win10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to windows 10, I keep receiving the Bsod Unexpected_store_exception when I try to play high end games.<br />
There was a short time period where I was able to play them on Win10, but now it's basically impossible since it crashes at loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried updating my drivers and bios. Even rolling back on my gpu drivers.</p>
