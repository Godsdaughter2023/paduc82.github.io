<p>Hey bad, sorry to hear you can't access those settings! Are they grayed out on the console, or on Xbox.com? Also, are you getting a specific error code when you try and access those settings on the console? What happens exactly?

            I'm not sure what are you said have unsafe or anywhere. But you want to startup, stay from the programs to start. If you don't want to startup, just set-up you don't want to start programs. That's it is a point.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do you receive any error message while trying to install webcam? If yes, then post back the exact error message.<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you able to install any other software?</p>
<p>Try capturing the error message on blue screen and post back the exact error message. This might help us in assisting you better.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Try installing the webcam software in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click Start, and then click Run. <br />
2.&nbsp;Type msconfig, and then click OK.<br />
The System Configuration Utility dialog box is displayed. <br />
3.&nbsp;Click the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4.&nbsp;When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</p>
<p>Refer: <br />
<strong>Using Event Viewer</strong><br />

<h2>            Internal speakers not detected</h2>
                    I have a Dell G5 15 computer. One day a popup from dell asked me to install some updates. I clicked install, and restarted the computer. When it booted up again, The audio symbol in the bottom right corner had a red circle with an X in it. The audio wasn't
 playing, the special keys wouldn't change the audio, so I clicked it. It opened a troubleshooter, which could find the problem, but couldn't fix it. The problem is the computer does not recognize that it has speakers. I opened up the settings for audio, chose
 other settings, and there was no audio device listed. The diagnostics said that Intel SST OED has a driver problem. Please tell me if you know how to fix this.

<div>
<div>one possibility is that upon the initial startup there are programs accessing the internet and checking for updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>then after they have done their daily checks, reboot may be faster.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>what you can try is to perform a cold boot (not a warm boot) into safe mode and see how quick it loads up.</div>

    <title>Windows not recognizing USB headset&#47;mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barb_699  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows not recognizing USB headset&#47;mic</h2>
                    <p>I have had this problem a few months ago on my HP computer and cannot remember where I went to fix the Windows setting. I use a USB headset and after I've been on my computer for a while not using the headset, I get the message that "No speakers or headphones
 are plugged in." When Windows tries to detect the problem, the only 2 devices that show up to detect problems are Realtek High Definition Audio or 1-Digital Display Audio - AMD High Definition Audio Device (HDMI connector). There is no choice for my USB headset
 any longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happened before I went to a Windows setting that is defaulted to turn off the device, and I had to default it to not run so it wouldn't turn off. For the life of me, cannot remember and can find no answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense. I know I halfway know what I'm talking about...I know if I restart it will probably fix this but I want to find this setting again. I don't know why it's back to turning it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Hi Barb, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I think I know what setting you're after. You might be talking about Device Manager, which is where you can view your headset and microphone. I'll show you where you can find it, and possibly reinstall the driver to get it working again:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your device in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Hardware and Devices. See if the troubleshooter fix the headset, or else you could try Playing Audio troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<p>USB Headsets require their own driver as they use their own pre-amp and don't go through your Realtek HD audio, which</p>
<p>only works on the speaker and headphone/mic&nbsp; jacks on the rear and front panel on your machine if using a desktop,</p>
<p>or headphone/mic output jacks on a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The AMD HDMI audio only works via the HDMI cable to monitor/TV speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you do have the drivers for your USB headset installed you need to set the headset as the
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback</span>
</em>tab.</p>
<p>(Or, <em>Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Sound Control Panel</em> )</p>

<p>I was thinking you were having difficulty finding where you had set the headset to default previously. I'm afraid I can't add much more to that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drivers for the headset have been reinstalled and it still does not show somewhere in Device Manager
</p>
<p>(USB Serial Bus Devices or Sound, Video or Game Controllers, most likely but maybe USB Serial Bus Controllers),
</p>
<p>or Sound&gt;Playback, about the only other thing I can think of is to try another USB port.</p>
<p>Failing that you may need to verify the headset is not faulty by trying it in another machine, or another USB headset in your machine.</p>

            Hi, I don’t have a working computer right now so this might have to wait til tomorrow. In the meantime, I just want to get peace of mind if my files will still be here? Is there no way of restoring anything right now? It says my desktop is missing too.

                    <p>I have encountered an issue recently that my DELL Inspiron 5559 Laptop is getting a BSOD every single time, when printing from the above mentioned Revit 2017 software and sometimes when printing bigger files from Autocad too. Printing works fine in other
 apps.</p>
<p>I have checked the minidumps and got this file there:<br />
<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AilSH_lUL0YwkB5fGimCYUdGh0B8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Only file in Minidump after BSOD</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i have tried to run the driver verifier with the official method(<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">here</a>)
 which doesn't even let windows start and it got into a bootloop (BSOD even before windows started, needed to restore to a previous state). It created another minidump file:<br />
<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AilSH_lUL0YwkB-9aHde39iLW80M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minidump file after driver verifier ran</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is sort of new. I got the windows with it. The printing was working file up until 1-2 months. No new hardware was installed.</p>
<p>Could you please help me to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Bence</p>

<p>Yes I have tried all the steps in the article.Checked for update in windows and updates for the laptop too with DELL's driver helper. Issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also deleted all the windows update and software that has been installed around the time the BSOD started happening. Issue still persists</p>
<p>
</p><p>No hardware has been added to the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performed a cleen boot of Windows as suggested in the linked article. This time the Revit software didn't even start up. So that was not a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article you have linked in your November 21 reply was about updating Windows. I am not sure what is the purpose of that. I already run Win10. My intent is to keep my softwares too not just the files. I would not consider reinstalling windows an acceptable
 solution.</p>
<p>

<p>BSOD can be caused by poorly written device drivers or malfunctioning hardware, such as faulty memory, power supply issues, overheating of components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. Incompatible DLLs or bugs in the operating system
 kernel could also cause BSOD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are suggesting to reinstall Windows 10 to replace Windows component to isolate if the issue is on the operating system. In the process provided by

<h2>            &#91;Windows10&#93; Bluetooth issues where I cannot connect to any device.</h2>
                    <p>I want to clarify that this problem only happened recently and the Bluetooth was working just fine before.<br />
<br />
I recently have a problem where when my main Windows 10 computer has not been able to connect to any bluetooth&nbsp;device. It would recognise the device and type but only in a generic name. For example, my smart TV would come up as "Display" and my Laptop (instead
 of its actual when discovered DESKTOP - XXXXXX) would just come up as "Laptop"<br />
<br />
When I try to pair with it will just time out and won't be able to pair. Trying to utilise sending files over bluetooth&nbsp;between them does not work either and simply just says waiting for a connection.<br />
<br />
I have an ASUS Z270E motherboard and have attached the needed peripherals (wifi card). I was initially&nbsp;trying to connect some controllers via bluetooth and this worked initially&nbsp;with the names coming up as "Pro Controller" or "Wireless Controller" whereas now
 it just comes up as "Input"<br />
<br />
I have done a multitude of things. In fact I have done everything that was said in this thread:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/bluetooth-wont-connect-to-any-device-windows-10/3cabea17-cf21-4308-9575-6461ae53d5c4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought maybe it was something I installed so I restored my PC back using the system recovery and the bluetooth error still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As frustrated as I was, I securely erased my SSD and installed a fresh new bit of windows again. Same problem. Installed all of the respective drivers from ASUS (W10 64BIT).<br />
<br />
I'm all out of options I'm afraid. I have no idea what to do. Please help. I just want to be able to connect my controllers / headphones once again.<br />
<br />
Also to note all my peripherals are not fauly and can connect to my laptop (Lenovo L450) and work properly. These peripherals were working on my PC before with bluetooth.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would be greatful for any help. Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />d. Click "Next" and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the issue persist, continue with Method 2. 
<br />
<br />Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall Bluetooth drivers. 
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R on your desktop screen to go to run command box. 
<br />2. Type devmgmt.msc and press Enter. 
<br />3. Look for Bluetooth driver, right-click and then click Uninstall/Remove Device.

For anyone else who happens upon this thread, I'll provide some details. Bluetooth was working fine on my Asus Z270E motherboard until I had an overclocking related crash, after which I could see some devices, but their proper names never came up. In particular,
 my Xbox One bluetooth controller was only seen as an "Input Device," but it would never connect.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Rebooting or disabling bluetooth/wireless in the BIOS didn't help at all. After I found this thread, I just turned off the switch on the back of my power supply until the motherboard standby LED went off. I flipped the switch back on, booted up, and bluetooth
 worked fine.</p>

    <title>A blank screen displays at the User Welcome screen after successful - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> get2it  say:</h3>
<h2>            A blank screen displays at the User Welcome screen after successful bootup or computer wake-up after upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 7 on a Gateway DX4300 desktop pc.</h2>
                    <br />
Although the welcome screen is completely blank (black), I am able to type in my password and enter then the computer opens my user desktop. When the user desktop opens, only the background picture displays but nothing else - no toolbars, icons, etc.
<br />
<br />
After 2 - 4 hard reboots, the Welcome screen may properly display and then everything works as expected. I have set the pc to never sleep, but the display goes to sleep after 15 minutes.
<br />
<br />
I noticed in the Devices and Printer window that under Devices my monitor (Gateway HX2000) is shown twice although there is only one actual monitor connected and both icon instances show the device is working properly. Under the Device Manager, two instances
 of Generic PnP Monitor are listed. I deleted one; however, it has repopulated two listed after reboot.

<p><span>Hi get2it,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community site. I would suggest you to try out these options:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Option 1: If the power light is on and nothing comes up on the screen when you start your computer, it is possible you have a bad video
 card. Test the monitor on another computer to see if the display works with another video card.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Option 2: If it does, try starting up your computer in Safe Mode or Enable low resolution video (640 × 480) Mode by holding down the
 F8 key as the computer boots up. You can any check for any screen resolution or color setting conflicts that may prevent your monitor from displaying an image properly by booting to desktop in Safe Mode or Enable low resolution video (640 × 480) Mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Option 3: You can also consider updating the display drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update a driver for hardware
 that isn't working properly</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can check the log around the time the crash occurred, or you can recreate the crash for current information. Here's an article on
 what information is available in Event Viewer Log File: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></a></p>

    <title>Do I need all these SQL servers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas badding  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I need all these SQL servers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 (64 bit). &nbsp;I have Microsoft SQL Server 2005, 2008 and 2012. &nbsp;For some reason, every time I shut down my computer, &nbsp;Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Service Pack 4 (KB2463332) gets "successfully" installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is that update constantly reinstalling itself? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I even NEED all these SQL Servers? &nbsp;Would just the latest one suffice? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question, I cannot perform a "restart". &nbsp;When I try to do so, upon restarting all I get is a black screen with a blinking line (cursor?) in the upper left corner. &nbsp;In order to do a simple restart or reboot, I have to command the computer to completely
 SHUT DOWN. &nbsp;If I do a complete shut down, the machine will start normally when I push the "ON" button. &nbsp;Why is that?</p>

    <title>Parent looking for gaming friends for Autistic child - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pambam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parent looking for gaming friends for Autistic child </h2>
                    
<p>I am the adoptive Mom of 6 whom would like to find some gaming friends for my 13 year old autistic child. My child speaks more like a 5-6 year old but is smart, able to read and really wants some friends to play with and chat with on his headset. It breaks
 my heart when he plays a multiplayer game and gets really excited when he receives a friend request.(He has parental controls so can not hear them) &nbsp;He &nbsp;begs and begs to accept it, however as an autistic child he would never fit into the world where gamers
 bad mouth, yell, and call names. He would shut down and obsess over this for days. He is a good gamer&nbsp;who plays for fun. He&nbsp;plays Borderlands, Gears of War, Minecraft, and a slew of other games. He plays daily. If anyone has the same problem or knows where
 I can go to find gaming matches for autistic kids, please let me know. He needs friends near his age or younger and I hate having him feel left out as his brothers both have extensive friends lists and friends to play with. I can see how my little guy does
 not understand why he can't have friends too. I have even considered starting my own web site to match up gamers with autism. Thanks... I would be so grateful and happy if I could match him up with even one or two (safe) friends for gaming. That is why I posted,
 so the parents can feel free to post back to me or email.</p>

<p>Hi, my son is 9 and is looking for friends....he and his friends play together and there is no bad language used...sometimes there will be excited shouting, but never any nastiness. They do play modern warfare 3 amongst themselves but also they play minecaft
 and this is where I thought your son would fit in perfectly...they are all a good bunch of kids who I'm sure would be more than happy to play alongside your son. (My sons xbox is in the lounge and has parental controls on so he can't play the shooting games
 without me there) You now have our gamertag so send us a friends request and a message explaining who u are - &nbsp;he doesn't add anyone he doesn't know - and we'll see how they get on :) take care

<p>Gamenymph, outside of a few private messages Id like to jump in. &nbsp;My daughter is high-functioning autistic, but I have been very reluctant to encourage a social online experience for her yet. &nbsp;She is smart in that autistic way, that I once caught her in
 a Pokemon chat room on the PC and it became clear that other individuals online were being rather harsh on her (not being aware of her autism). &nbsp;I did, however, get her into a Pokemon card league which has helped immensely with her social skills (and its something
 I can pay attention to a lot easier). &nbsp;SO when it came to an online thing with the xbox, I've been very protective. &nbsp;Seeing as how there is such a wide range of behaviors to autism, I guess just like anyone else, maybe similar games is a good starting point?</p>

<p>Not sure if this thread is still being looked at, but I'm in a similar situation with my 12yo Autistic daughter. She LOVES minecraft and other games but never quite fits in. She can't handle bullies or cursing but would benefit so much from an Xbox buddy
 or two. She interacts better on Xbox than at middle school. Feel free to message me. She has mic through Kinect. I am always in the room when she plays so supervise. Any fellow spectrum kiddos who would like a gentle minecraft lover as a friend, my daughter
 would be great. She's a good kid, just very delayed socially. </p>

<p>I am &nbsp;hoping someone may still look at this thread. My son is 11 and has high functioning autism. He just got xbox live. So far only plays Minecraft. He does not have a mic. He is looking for friends to play Minecraft with. He is a very kind player with
 good sportsmanship. He would not fair well if bullied, so I am supervising all invites. Please message me if want to be online friends. Ages 8-13 only please. Thank you!</p>

<p>What a lovely post, I myself am a high-functioning autistic (now aged 30) and I can relate a lot to the problems that are being expressed here.</p>
<p>I recently had a bad experience with a fellow gamer who played fifa 15. Sadly I now have lost quite a few friends because they don't understand how difficult being autistic is (not to mention that that gamer was a lying, cheating and foul-mouthed child).</p>
<p>Sincerely hope you can find some good players out there.</p>
<p>I'm still struggling myself but then when you have social difficulties it's never easy.</p>

<p>Hi. I am a mom to a 17yr girl with severe autism. She doesn't play, but just wanted to say that your post really touched me. My heart goes out to your son and I am confident that there are lots of other kids in the same situation. It's just a matter of connecting.
</p>
<p>Also, if any of you parents (with or without autistic children) would like to add me, feel free.

<p>Thanks so much for this post. My grandson is 10, and has autism. He tried playing online, but the kids would just make fun of him. I was hoping there was a way to set up groups for children with special needs to play online without fear of abuse, but I guess
 that's not possible. I'm going to let my daughter know about this thread. Hopefully, she can find some friends for him. Thanks again!</p>

<h3> kubar123  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows installer &#40;1603 during Office pro Plus 13 Installation&#41;</h2>
                    I posted about this in the Office 2013 section, but someone mentioned that the 1603 error means its a problem with the windows installer, and told me to try asking in the windows section too...<br />
<br />
<br />
I am trying to install MS office 2013 Pro Plus on my 2nd laptop- its Windows 7 Enterprise 32 bit.<br />
When I try to install it, and go through the setup, at the very last sec it says "Microsoft office pro plus 2013 encountered an error during setup"<br />
During the setup my explorer (explorer.exe service) is killed, and when I press the 'ok' button on the MS office installer (after it failed) it says "windows installer has stopped responding..."<br />
<br />
In the log file that the setup produces I get the error 1603--- the full log file can be downloaded here<br />
http://puu.sh/1Pc1Q<br />
<br />
Link to the other question I asked- <br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/1603-error-during-installlation-of-ms-office-2013/ae3e5d6d-3ae8-4820-b56c-cbba1cf823a4<br />
<br />
So far I have tried...<br />
<ul>
<li>Deleting Microsoft Help folder</li><li>MS Fix It program</li><li>Task scheduler- enabling service and making sure its not corrupt</li><li>Ms troubleshooter to remove any corrupt office 2013 files</li><li>Windows installer service is set to automatic</li><li>Cleared the temp folder</li><li>Started computer in Clean boot mode</li><li>taking ownership of C:\windows</li><li>cacls C:\windows /g administrators:F</li><li>(restarting the computer- obviously)</li><li>Checking the Reg Permissions- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</li><li>checking the reg permissions- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</li><li>clearing %temp%</li><li>Reg Cleaner- CCleaner</li><li>installing on another computer (worked fine)</li><li>making new user accounts</li><li>logging in as the default windows Administrator account</li><li>applying new updates to windows</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks guys, Hope someone can help me with this.</p>

            <p>I assume you have installed that same copy on another system? If not, I would try downloading a fresh copy and reattempt the install again. You could also try extracting the contents of the .ISO or .exe to a folder on your hard disk and right click the setup
 file and click Run as administrator. </p>

            <p>Hmm, .IMG, try burning it to a blank DVD and then attempt the install from the disc:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ImgBurn - In addtion to supporting the creation of CD's from .ISO files,<br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free.<br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, <strong>IMG</strong>, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />

<p>I play it all the time and it hadn't connected to live once. But just recently for the first time since the game was released it connected! Seriously like five minutes ago! So a lot of new stuff to do and figure out now. Thanks to those who responded and
 I hope to those that had troubles with the game gets fixed too.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>KZG Inferno. There was an issue with Xbox Live which has been resolved now - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a> this could have caused what you were seeing.</p>
<p>For the OP, as mentioned Watch Dogs is under heavy load and Ubisoft is working on resolving the connection issues. If connection fails try again later and you should connect just fine.</p>

    <title>pining tiles to the task bar, Edge doesn&#39;t show in task bar when - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            pining tiles to the task bar, Edge doesn&#39;t show in task bar when in use</h2>
                    <p>After the recent updates, my Edge behaves much differently, and with no explanations. There is now no way to pin it to the task bar. The drag and drop feature doesn't work there now, and there is no feature in the "more" area of the drop down menu (right
 click) to pin it to the task bar. And, the Edge icon doesn't show in the taskbar when Edge is in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When moving between different apps. Edge disappears and must be reopened, which can be rather annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently asked why I was using Chrome, when I also had Edge, and was told by MS staff that Edge was "more secure". Well, maybe so, and it is not obviously so,&nbsp; but it doesn't appear to be "more dependable".&nbsp; If it disappears each time I use it before
 I click it off, how can I be efficient with it? So, MS gets a big "duh!' on that one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could say the same about the Defender app, and why one should&nbsp; have multiple malware apps. When one goes down or becomes undependable, what is left for one to do...?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is, how does one have his cake and eat it, too? (Buy two cakes? And, don't depend on only one to be sooo good?))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a remedy for this recent update? How do I get my Edge to stay on until I click it off, and not disappear, requiring a restart by going to the start menu,&nbsp; just because I started looking at another app (like, for example, word) ?&nbsp; How do I get Edge
 to show in the task bar, when in use, or when I want it to be there for clicking on later with out going to the window button to search the start menu? I just might have a need to copy/paste things back and forth, like I used to be able to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Since you installed recent updates, make sure to update drivers as well to avoid further software conflicts. If you find your pinned Windows icons becoming invisible on the taskbar, we recommend doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Go to C:\Users\AppDAta\Local (where Users = name of user on PC). This folder is hidden by default so you may need to view hidden files and folders<br />
2. Delete IconCache.db<br />
3. Restart the system and check if issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get back to us if you need further assistance.
        </p>

    <title>Xbox One controller keeps losing pairing, even though - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One controller keeps losing pairing, even though it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s really not</h2>
                    
<p>I haven't really tested this much, but here's what's going on. &nbsp;If I put my controller down for even a few seconds and then pick it back up, I get a message from the game that my controller has lost it's pairing to the console. &nbsp;I can immediately exit out
 of the message with the same controller, leading me to believe it's not really losing connection. Have tried using the controller even with the USB cord that comes with the Play and Charge kit, and it still does it. &nbsp;Also tried pairing it again, still doing
 it.</p>
<p>It's only when I put it down though, it doesn't happen while I'm actually playing.</p>
<p>I tried updating the controller already, didn't help either. &nbsp;I'm about 99% sure the Xbox console is running on the latest updates too.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I've only been playing Assassin's Creed BF lately, nothing else.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas or seen this before?</p>

<p>If you have Kinect, it will see if you're holding the controller or not, and if you put it down or pass it to someone else it will unpair with your profile.
</p>
<p>I does seem more sensitive in some games than others. particularly in the games that came out at launch when the only option was to get a Kinect.

<p>The Kinect thing is close to the answer for my problem. &nbsp;It didn't used to do it, it started up all the sudden one day. I did isolate it to having to do with the Kinect for sure because I realized that it would sometimes happen when I sat down but before
 I touched the controller.</p>
<p>I did restore it to factory and reloaded all the stuff I care about. So far, so good. I'm about 24 hours in so we'll see.</p>
