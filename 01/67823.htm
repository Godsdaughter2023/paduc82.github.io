<p>I get the same message if I try and do a system mirror &nbsp;image on another 120 GB available space partition. &nbsp;I through I would re install windows 7 Professional, but once I select a drive where it must install it to, I get the same message: &nbsp;"There is not
 enough disk space " &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            hi, I would suggest to do a clean install of windows by choosing custom option when you boot into recovery and delete your partitions until one unallocated space is left then install windows again instead of trying what your doing cheers

            <p>Thanks you for the advice. &nbsp;I have tried that as well but I still reads "Not enough space." &nbsp;This message only appears when I want to install a system file ! &nbsp;I can install other software with &nbsp;no issues. &nbsp;I am too scared to format my &nbsp;entire hard drive,
 as I afraid that &nbsp;I may not be able to install any windows operating system again, which obviously would result in "no PC". &nbsp;This problem is driving me crazy. &nbsp;Do you think that if I install Umbuntu &nbsp;I will be able to &nbsp;fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks C</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 lags and slows down.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have an HP laptop, model 250 g3, i5-4210U 1.7ghz (dual), 6gb ram, 1tb hdd and nvidia geforce 820m.</p>
<p>recently my laptop or windows were malfunctioning so i did a clean boot and installed windows10 clean again. after the updates it has started to slow down and lag again. the games that i have run on this laptop at full speed before like mafia 2 and assassins
 creed 2 also suffer from major lags. the windows login screen is also very slow and takes a lot of time. Its not only slow while gaming, but also while i browse my internet, or watch videos or listen to music.</p>
<p>i have a very specefic set of softwares i use each time namely picasa, vlc medica player &nbsp;internet download manager and google chrome.i havent installed any other software myself and it has been slow and lagging.</p>
<p>i havent tried a fix since clean windows install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>please help.</p>
<p />

            I don't know if this will be any help but check for any Apache downloads. There seems to be a problem where the error logs will take up all available space and pretty much cripple system. I'm still looking for a way to get rid of error log or prevent it
 going more than 4Kb (it was up to 78.1Gb!) I deleted the error log folder yesterday but it's already back to 49,000+Kb since re-boot (maybe 2 hrs run time)

            Oh, one other thing, check size of page file, it seems to want at least 20% of hard drive. I reduced it to minimum size which helped a lot. I also turned off just about everything I could that was included with Win 10 as I had zero use for it

            <p>Did you fix it?</p>
<p>I don't think Google Chrome 'plays nice' with download manager. Google tracks just about everything you do online even when you tell them not to so 'they' can send you better advertisements. I don't use it but it has to be installed to use some programs
 I use. I went back to Firefox and Edge (MS Edge does seem faster on any Microsoft site)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashed and now can only boot when in safe mode</h2>
                    <p>My Acers laptop crashed yesterday while streaming two live videos simultaneously. Since then, it keeps going into the blue screen Recovery page and can only be booted by going into safe mode. I have tried Startup Repair from the advanced options and it couldn't
 help. I also used Reimage Repair software and it detected and fixed problems with the Registry, but it still hasn't helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The safe mode with networking option works and I can access windows that way, but I can't boot it normally. If I reset the windows, will I lose the games and One Note files I have on that laptop?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Flash player</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 10 on 2 computers...one with little to no hickups and&nbsp;my main one&nbsp;with so many&nbsp;constant issues....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main PC (i7 sandybridge ,Nvidia GTX 970) &nbsp;seems to take an age to close down now...and then sometimes when its booted I get the circular loading mouse for a long time with no ability to click on things...I often have to 'reset' to get my PC to become
 responsive again after a boot...It seems to be hit and miss...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had issues with watching youtube videos and internet TV players...Freezing after a few minutes and none responsive until I hit the windows key and so on...Its a nightmare when I want to settle down to watch something....I can't tweak Flash player
 because Windows 10 has complete control over it now...so no tweaking there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IE crashes for no reason from time to time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't access google maps in IE 11....I get a message saying my browser needs to be to date and my IE telling me I have the current one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all the messing about restoring and reinstalling I have now lost my ability to return to Windows 7 which to be honest I would have done by now...Seems I am stuck with this unwanted free monster now....Upgrading to Windows 10 was easy...It is also the
 worst OS I have had on any PC...Until I have a solution or an update which frees me of this frustrating botch I am warning folks not to upgrade.....Thanks Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response Mohammed..Its much appreciated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the 'Clean Boot' and am in the process of seeing how the PC performs...Although having gone from Windows 7 to 10 I was unfamiliar with the layout of 8 and 8.1 so I had a bit of figuring to understand how the guide to 'clean boot' was....but I
 managed it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for 'optional features' as you showed above throws up an Error 'Windows can not find 'optional'..so that was a no goer....although using Google Chrome or Firefox seems to give me no video player issues so that workaround is what I am doing at the
 moment..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happier with my PC after your help mohammed..Thank you very much</p>

Windows 7 - Working With The Scanner And Camera Installation Wizard<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows7/Working-with-the-Scanner-and-Camera-Installation-wizard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows7/Working-with-the-Scanner-and-Camera-Installation-wizard</a>
<br />
</p>
<p>OK...something to try...<br />
<br />
Connect the camera to the PC via USB cable and<br />
turn the camera on.<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Computer...<br />
<br />
Look at the drive letters and see if one of them<br />
represents the camera. It may say Removable Disk<br />
<br />
If the camera is recognized...right click the drive letter<br />
and from the menu choose...Open or Explore.<br />
<br />
The directory of the memory card in the camera should<br />
be displayed and if you navigate through the various<br />
folders you should find the photo files.<br />
<br />
Once found...you can copy/paste the photos to a folder<br />
on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Simple and best solution IMHO is to use an internal <br />
or external USB Memory Card reader.<br />
<br />
It won't drain your camera batteries and may be faster. <br />
FWIW...downloading from the camera when batteries <br />
may be low after a long photo shoot could result in<br />
corrupted photos.</p>

<p><span>I own the Canon Image Class MF3110. &nbsp;The printer worked perfectly with Windows Vista Business.</span></p>
<p><span>My problem is with the Windows 7 drivers. I upgraded to Windows 7 Pro 64bit installed and everything worked well except for the Canon printer.</span></p>

<p><span>I tried to install the new drivers for the printer from ur website (file name: MF3110_MFDrivers_Win_x32_us_EN_7.exe). I am getting the following error: "this setup program is not for 64-bit
 windows". Obviously this a 32-bit versus 64-bit compatibility issue. Pls help, I cant use my canon printer anymore. Thanks.</span></p>

            Hi Paul
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could you provide the specific model of the Canon printer you are using?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Its possible you might need to apply a firmware update.

    <title>Transferring a digital game to a separate account other than the one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrioticgamer0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring a digital game to a separate account other than the one the game was purchased on.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a digital copy of No Mans Sky on my Xbox that I have multiple accounts on. I have a controller for each account, as they are used by separate people, so I have a specific controller log in one of the 3 accounts on the Xbox. When I bought the copy of the game I had grabbed a different controller then usual while turning on Thebes Xbox, this prompting me to purchase the game on Ann account I didn’t intend to. Because of this I was wondering ignore there was&nbsp;a way to transfer digital purchases between accounts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Nothing can be transferred between accounts. You can try getting a refund and then repurchase the game on the correct account. You would need to go to <a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;to see if you can start a refund there. If not, you would need to contact support and speak to billing. 1-800-4my-xbox if you're in the US/Canada or http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

<h2>            Slow WiFi on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>I'm having the same problem I've literally seen thousands of users complaining about, slow wi-fi speeds on Surface Book 2.&nbsp; I've tried all of the dozen different "fixes" but still hover around 10mb if I'm lucky.&nbsp; This machine is over $2k, Microsoft should
 be ashamed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is... do you see any possible fix for this in the near future, or should I just return it and purchase a machine from a company who has their act together?</p>

            That's odd, i have the Surface Pro Tablet, the wifi speeds are great. I think it may be a hardware problem. The wifi card in the surface book is probably not the best for whatever reason.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">1. uninstall "Marvell AVASTAR" (driver version 15.68.9120.47) device from Device Manager (control panel, network adapter) (riht button,
 properties, driver tab, uninstall device) , 2) download version 15.68.9114.29 from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=marvell+avastar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=marvell+avastar</a><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">&nbsp;3)
 then on device manager, click icon with magnifying glass on screen (search hardware changes), it finds Marvell device again and 4) right button, properties, driver, driver update, choose downloaded version 15.68.9114.29 and 5) restart. PROBLEMS FIXED.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>Hello, I have the <strong>Synology 1900ac</strong> : https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/RT1900ac</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, also have a <strong>Surface Pro 4</strong>, that has the old driver (<span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">15.68.9114.29</span>), running Insider Preview build 18343.19h1. The registry is = 1 (default value).

<h2>            ADD&#47;REMOVE PROGRAMS CORRUPT</h2>
                    <p>A friend's computer was infected with numerous viruses and a&nbsp;ton of malware. When she would boot the computer it would launch IE and continue launching it over and over faster than you could close them until the computer bogged down to a crawl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used a few different virus scanners as well as malwarebytes and it would appear it is clean now except the add/remove program list has a ton of items listed that are not programs and there is no way to get rid of them or clean and rebuild the list that
 I can see. I could try a restore point but she is not sure when the problem started and thinks all was okay in August but I hate to take&nbsp;a chance on restoring and then finding out the viruses are all back plus I am not sure what was done since that point that
 might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would appreciate knowing if there is anyway to rebuild the add/remove list or what the consequences of restoring to a point two months ago would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other option would be to restore the registry from the regback folder but again am not sure what the negative consequences of this might be either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate some advice from someone knowledgeable on the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just checked and it would appear that either Windows XP did not use a regback folder or if they did it is in a different location than in Windows 8.</p>

<p>It's an old computer with XP. She has no idea where the recovery disks are and even if she did find them it is XP and I don't think updates are available any longer to bring it up to where it is now. I think there was 3 service packs and likely hundreds
 if not thousands of security and other patches and fixes. She has software that she needs to use with XP plus am not sure that computer would run 7 or 8.</p>

            <p>I don't know what a ton of items means but everything you see in Add/Remove programs is just a folder in the Registry.&nbsp; Find and delete that entry in the Registry and it will no longer show up in Add/Remove programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could take that just section of the registry concerning Add/Remove Programs from an old Restore Point and replace it in your live registry.&nbsp; You would have to use some other tools to do that (but you could do it) butit can be done but who knows how far
 back you would need to go - some trial and error might work.&nbsp; I don't feel like explaining it to be honest...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could look at the current registry and search for the things in Add/Remove Programs you want to no longer see there and when you find it in the registry, delete that key.&nbsp; Repeat as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a MS article that can get you started:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310750</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember:&nbsp; There is no undo or quit without saving option in the registry editor, so before you make changes, backup your registry with this free tool called ERUNT:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make as many backups as you want as you go along.&nbsp; If something goes wrong, you can restore the last backup (or the original) and just start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day I had to 'splain all this to somebody so made some notes that may only make sense to me but may give you some other ideas:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall Pro may help remove broken Add/Remove program entries:<br />
<br />
http://www.soft32.com/download_9082.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyfBWu3fzhCl2SIB0x2L9StWN7kg<br />
<br />
You can use CCleaner to run the uninstall routine for the program or just delete the entry from the Add/Remove Programs list.&nbsp; You may still have files and folders for the program though since the unintall was not done properly, but it will not show up in the
 list anymore.&nbsp; Get CCLeaner here:<br />
<br />
www.ccleaner.com<br />
<br />
What you see in Add/Remove programs comes from individual entries in the registry.
<br />
<br />
You can read this article from Microsoft about how to remove unwanted items from Add/Remove<br />
Programs that may not have uninstalled properly:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310750<br />
<br />
There is no undo or quit without saving option in the registry editor, so before you make
<br />
changes, backup your registry with this free tool called ERUNT:<br />
<br />
http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html<br />
<br />
If you do not install ERUNT you are taking a risk editing your registry and some of what follows will not make sense since I use the ERUNT installation as an example.<br />
<br />
To open the registry editor, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
regedit<br />
<br />
Click OK.<br />
<br />
Using regedit, navigate here:<br />
<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall<br />
<br />
There is a lot of stuff in the Uninstall folder and what you see under it may not be obvious unless you scroll through them one by one.&nbsp; Start clicking and looking through the list on the left and then look on the right hand side and you will start to see things
 you recognize. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is important to understand that not everything you see under the Uninstall folder will show up in Add/Remove Programs, but everything you see in Add/Remove Programs will show up under the Uninstall folder.<br />
<br />
As you land on each entry in the Uninstall folder on the left, on the right hand side is the contents of the registry key for each installed program.<br />
<br />
Find some Uninstall folders with names you recognize.&nbsp; You will see some values under Uninstall
<br />
that have an information value on the right called DisplayName.&nbsp; That is what you see in
<br />
Add/Remove Programs. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may also see an entry called UninstallString.&nbsp; That is what will get run when you click the
<br />
Remove button in Add/Remove programs.&nbsp; There is a lot of other interesting information that will<br />
start to make sense from what you see in Add/Remove Programs.<br />
<br />
You will have some things under the Uninstall folder that may not appear to make sense<br />
or not have much information under them on the right hand side.&nbsp; Just leave these alone unless
<br />
you know what the are.<br />
<br />
If you installed ERUNT, it will show up in Add/Remove programs and you also now be able to find
<br />
the ERUNT program in the list of Uninstall folders on the left and see the DisplayName and
<br />
UninstallString for ERUNT on the right.<br />
<br />
You can search for an entry under the Uninstall folder to help you find things that you see in
<br />
Add/Remove Programs.&nbsp; In regedit, click and highlight the Uninstall folder on the left hand side,
<br />
then click Edit, Find and search for the program name you see displayed in Add/Remove Programs and you will be taken right to the entry.&nbsp; You may land on the DisplayName value on the right and can see that the appropriate Uninstall folder will be open on the
 left.<br />
<br />
If you are convinced the program is uninstalled after looking on your hard disk and the
<br />
entry still shows up in Add/Remove programs, it can be deleted from the Uninstall list in the registry by right clicking the folder in the Uninstall list and choosing delete.&nbsp; You will not see
<br />
the program listed in Add/Remove Programs again.&nbsp; Deleting a value under Uninstall is not the<br />
way to uninstall a program - it will just remove it from the Add/Remove Programs list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting an Uninstall key in the registry just removes the entry from Add/Remove programs and does not delete any folders that might be on the hard drive so you may have to follow up removing folders on the hard drive too so pay attention to what you are
 deleting and where it is "pointing" and do any additional cleanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also export the appropriate Uninstall key to a file before deleting it.&nbsp; If something goes
<br />
wrong, you can import the file later to replace just the registry key you accidentally deleted.&nbsp; That
<br />
will not reinstall the program, but it will show up again in Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get your confidence up, just work on one single item to see how things work.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply and thank you to ElderK as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Malwarebytes. Avast, McAfee. Microsoft Safety Scanner, FixMeStick and another scanner that has just slipped my mind right now. The computer seems to be running really well with no slow down in speed but realize that doesn't necessarily mean it
 is clean either so will follow your instructions above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that seems to be&nbsp;a problem now is the entries In add/remove programs and unlike the legitimate entries there is no size to the right of the entry and when you select any of them there is nothing saying the last time it was used nor is there
 any button to change delete or anything like there is for a normal. Many of the entries are just numbers and there is usually three entries that seem to be
</p>
<p>together like</p>
<p>5600</p>
<p>5600_help</p>
<p>5600TRB</p>
<p>

<p>6200TRB</p>
<p>

            <p>Some of those entries look familiar (more information is good).</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - You can't rely on what Add/Remove Programs tells you about size, last date used, etc. to show accurate data - even for legitimate programs. &nbsp; That is a known "issue" for XP and would be another topic of discussion about how that works (and how it doesn't).&nbsp;
 Just don't count on it to be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you perform a Google search on some of your entries, like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>add&nbsp; remove&nbsp; programs&nbsp; 5600_help</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get some hits that you can read about.&nbsp; Some of them look like maybe HP software but since we don't know anything about the afflicted system except it is an "old computer with XP" that may not apply to your situation but at least it has been seen
 before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to see if any of them have ideas that sound like they will work, I would stick with the ones from bleepingcomputer.com (where I also participate under another name).&nbsp; They have malware removal experts there better know how to use other tools
 to clean up your system and if you get help from them that is one thing to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just want to get rid of the entries in Add/Remove Programs, you can just remove them from the Registry.&nbsp; Just "experiment" with one or two and see how it goes and then you can decide to keep going or take another approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am not 100% sure about what I am doing in the registry (and sometimes other places) or breaking my system on purpose to learn how to fix it I always try to have a plan for what am I going to do if the system does not boot when I am done - how am I going
 to undo the last changes I made so the system will boot again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like ERUNT because if you afflict the registry somehow in a way the system will no longer boot, you can boot into the XP Recovery Console (or on a Hiren's Boot CD) and quickly restore the entire registry to a backup that you made prior to the system not
 booting.&nbsp; You would have a hard time doing that by just exporting part of the registry, but you can do both to be safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before messing with the uninstall section, export the uninstall section of what you have to your desktop someplace you can find it (screenshot from Windows 7 but it works the same way):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffbc0425-f2b5-468a-b8da-6397e871ff85" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To get some confidence in the method, pick an entry or two in Add/Remove Programs you want to get rid of, remove them from the registry, reboot and see how things look.&nbsp; A reboot is not required, but reboot anyway to be sure you are on the right track.&nbsp;
 If it looks good, keep going just doing a little bit at a time backing up/exporting as you go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Ken Blake says, you may decide that reinstalling or replacing XP is what you need to do but if your only concern at the moment is cleaning up ARP, you should be able to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that unless you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't) when you run sfc /scannow it is going to complain - alot.&nbsp; That should always be the first thing to ask before
 making that suggestion, but nobody ever does.</p>
<p>Even if it runs successfully, you will never know what it did or didn't do since there is no report/log so if you a enjoy frustrating waste of your time where nothing gets fixed, go for it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And sfc /scannow does not "replace missing or corrupt system files" in the manner that most people believe (and I can prove it) and it has nothing to do with what you see in Add/Remove programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggesting sfc /scannow is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".</p>
<p>

<p>I did not reference the size and last date used for potential lack of accuracy of the entries but the fact is that information is missing, as is the change or remove option when you highlight one of these items. There is simply only a name like the few mentioned
 above but once highlighted no additional information is shown nor is there any option to remove the item, unlike legitimate entries in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used CCleaner and it does bring up a list of everything shown in add/remove programs unlike Revo Uninstaller which only seems to bring up the ones that look like legitmate entries as they have the additional information on the right that is normal
 with most items in the add/remove programs list and also include a remove button.

</p><p>My main concern it what happens if I select an item like 5600 and select to remove it? If it only removes the entry from the list, then that is great and is what I want. I don't know if there is a program called 5600 or 6200 or the other probably 30 or 40
 of what seem to be rogue entries. A search of 5600 or 5600_help does bring up some hits but none that seem to provide any information about what they are or what they do. I would just like to remove the names from add/remove programs list without uninstalling
 anything or modifying any actual program but am not sure when removing items from the list with CCleaner whether it looks for and removes any files that may somehow be linked or associated with the items like 5600.</p>

            <p>Sorry - I don't know...&nbsp; maybe somebody else has some idee-ers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember using CCleaner to remove something from Add/Remove, just that it was available in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that when you use Revo, it looks in the Uninstall registry section to see if there is an uninstall executable or script to run (that is what Add/Remove does too) and if it finds an uninstall routine, it runs it (just like Add/Remove) like in this
 example for ERUNT:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3aa56136-de30-4566-b6e3-47a45857eb8c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you choose to uninstall ERUNT, it's gonna do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Program Files\ERUNT\unins000.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what CCleaner does - probably the same thing so if you look a the 5600 in the registry and there is a populated UninstallString, I imagine it would try to run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find for the 5600 the registry details are on the right are missing or don't make any sense so in that case, I would just whack it - if there is no UninstallString, you won't be able to uninstall it anyway since XP, Revo or CCleaner won't know how
 to uninstall it (they may just whack it too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is great fun, isn't it?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you are getting closer though :-)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>haha, great fun indeed. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the example you have above with ERUNT, is that what I would see if I went into the registry, providing everything is as it should be, where the centre column would be shown when I select ERUNT, and the column on the far right would also be shown on the
 same screen, or have you pulled those out of other areas just to explain what happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could go check the registry and answer my own question too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Starting with the Uninstall folder selected right click it and Find for something you know is NOT afflicted - like ERUNT:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a244d692-bac0-461c-85ab-43dfd46653da" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can see what a legitimate entry looks like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders immediately under Uninstall with the goofy looking names may if fact be legitimate installations (click one then look on the right hand side to see what it says) and if you look further down under those you will start to see folders with names
 that make more sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you see under DisplayName is what shows up in Add/Remove Programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce7a300c-fc76-4224-aff1-d24ae55f2608" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So you would start back at the top with the Uninstall folder and Find (search) for something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>6200_help</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6f4d67-fb88-4184-9150-64c436299d98" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I don't have that, but you will.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can look at the right hand side and decide if it looks like it makes sense or not.&nbsp; Look at the InstallLocation, UninstallString and other things and if things are missing or don't make sense it might not be a legitimate entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on DisplayName, Publisher, InstallLocation, UninstallString - my ERUNT entry in the registry looks like it matches what I see in Add/Remove Programs, so it makes sense:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89af46b5-f3a3-4340-b2dc-88af38b1dc23" /></p>
<p>See what your ERUNT entry looks like so you will know what a good one looks like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before deleting anything you can Export that key to your desktop or someplace you can find it, delete it from the Uninstall folder, exit Regedit, reboot and see if it is now gone from Add/Remove Programs.&nbsp; If you have a whoops moment, import the key and
 start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just do one to see how it works and get some confidence in the method.&nbsp; If you are not sure about one, look for another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Export out the entire Uninstall folder often so that if you make a mistake, you can just import the last export you made and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have tons to work on, I hope it all works out for you.&nbsp; This method works for me when I just have to delete one or two or three dingle berries.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the original issue/problem/question was along the lines of how to get rid of things in Add/Remove programs that don't make sense so this is how to do that.&nbsp; You may have some other fallout from the malware too and if yours is really, really afflicted
 you may end up having to punt and someday reinstall your XP (or live with it).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1607 - How to ruin a good OS</h2>
                    <p>Hello and welcome to Windows 10 1607 rant/discussion,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 2015 i actually liked Windows 10. It was a nice looking OS, super easy to use, but had a few bugs i&nbsp;<em>thought
</em>would be resolved eventually. I loved how the start menu worked so well and looked like Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Fast forward to 2016 and now we have the so called Windows 10 "anniversary update" or Build 1607.</p>
<p>I will start by saying that Microsoft took a good OS and trashed it! How?</p>
<ul>
<li>The start menu is a hideous mess! I refuse to get 1607 mainly because of it.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>First off, i don't want to look at all my installed apps. Second, i hate that all of the quick shortcuts on the menu (File explorer, power, user account) are jammed at the bottom left corner of the start menu. And to see tags for them, you have to click
 on a "hamburger" button. that's just plain retarded! I also hate how they killed off the jump lists in start. I used to like how your user account was at the top of the start menu. Not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft Edge is still useless.</li></ul>
<p>Edge is still buggy and slow. And It's not just my PC. I have worked on several other PC's with Windows 10, and Edge is just as buggy on all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Too much clutter</li></ul>
<p>Windows 10 1607 has too much clutter. They install apps that you will never use. Such as 3D builder, Phone, Etc. Also that new notes thing, or whatever it is. Who is going to use that?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The UI is still an inconsistent mess. You right click on the taskbar, and you get a different menu that you would get on the desktop. The context menus in file explorer are different than the one on the desktop.&nbsp;</li><li>The settings app looks even worse than before, and makes me want control panel back even more.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Too many bugs</li></ul>
<p>Windows 10 STILL has a lot of bugs and too many updates. And a lot of the updates cause more problems than do good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, MS tried so hard to make promote Windows 10 look and feel like Windows 7. They didn't want to mess up like Windows 8. But now that Windows 10 has gained a lot of users, they think they can screw with it, and change stuff without asking. I
 am trying to avoid Windows 10 1607 on my laptop, but if i am forced to install it soon, i will just go back to 8.1. And the Windows 10 "creators" update isn't looking any better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any comments or suggestions, please reply. Rude comments will not be tolerated.

<p>I do not not agree with that at all.</p>
<p>I paid to get an OS, not f***ing cluttered software. Further there is no option even to choose what will be installed.</p>
<p>The 1607 update just destroyed my personal setings, worst the network settings for my home network...</p>
<p>I spend hours to get rid of unwanted software, then a "system update, which does not even deserve that name, brings me back to square one...</p>
<p>Windows 10 is an OS, not more!</p>

            What you consider clutter others consider to be useful tools. Messing with them and trying to remove them rather than not use them is likely to cause you problems. It's entirely up to you how you deal with the situation and the consequences of your actions
 are your problem.

            <p>Not to point out the obvious, but the Start menu hasn't worked right since Windows XP. It got broken in Windows 7 because a programmer introduced a bug when developing it and we later found out that when bugs get introduced, they delete the code because
 no one at Microsoft is able to fix bugs so they just delete that part of the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yes, the 1607 version of the Start Menu is probably the worst iteration of the Start menu that Microsoft has ever designed.</p>
<p>You are stuck with a ton of Microsoft programs that you can't remove, others that you can remove but will reinstall themselves, and the few things you do use are hidden within the trash heap that you can't find them anyways.</p>

            Agreed 100% It's sad how people still need to use a 3rd party start menu since MS just can't get it right.

            With 1607, I want to keep what Windows has offered but it removes Cortana in the changes and the&nbsp;resulting hunt to remedy that along with other changes and continued added disk&nbsp;space&nbsp;occupancy&nbsp;is quite frustrating and needs to be addressed.

<h2>            Win 7 doesn&#39;t see USB broadband modem.</h2>
                    I've been using the SpeedUp SU-8200 3.5G Mobile Connect USB broadband modem for the last 2 years.<br />
It was running fine with Win XP Pro sp3 first, then with Win 7 RC1.<br />
Now I bought a new PC, its OS is Win 7 HP, it recognize and run the software, but then the SW doesn't see any device.<br />
In device manager Win see a data interface, but without any driver, but that's the funny thing, this device doesn't need and doesn't come with any cd or driver.<br />
Speeduptech.com is down, pls help me!<br />

            Hi Batuhitam,<br />
<br />
Uninstall your USB broadband modem from the device manager, restart the computer and connect the USB modem to a different USB post and check if it installs the drivers automatically.<br />
<br />
If that does not help, I'd want to suggest few methods that could help.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1 : Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong> <br />
<br />
If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Configure a device.‌&nbsp; Administrator permission
 required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
If that did not help, try to run it in Compatibility mode by following the steps in the following link :<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong><br />
<br />
If none of the above steps help, you may have to get in touch with the manufacturer for support as they are the best people to offer support for their product.<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim 4GB memory with 250GB Hard Drive Freezing Problems</h2>
                    Hey Guys, I have no idea what's up with my Xbox. It keeps freezing everytime I go back to the dashboard from playing a game. When the xbox is connected to the internet, everytime, I see a loading logo that pops up, and it takes about 30 min for it to freeze.
 Playing a game is fine, no freezing occurs in gameplay. I can't access my storage settings, a loading logo pops up when I press A on Storage settings to clear my cache than freezes. I just need to clear my cache so I can get rid of the freezing problmes. I
 had this xbox for 6 months now. Please find the solution, I can't even play Xbox Live beacause of this...Everytime I connect to the internet more freezing problems occur. Please help!

<h2>            Skyrim Xbox one special edition &#43; Backwards compatible</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. New to the forums</p>
<p>I've just seen pre orders of skyrim Xbox one come up online for pre order. As I've read it will have updated graphics etc.</p>

<p>When its made backwards compatible, will it be the same? Or will the backwards compatible be the 360 version just ported over?</p>
<p>Also I presume all pre purchased DLC will be added too.</p>

<p>I bought the special edition skyrim when it was first released, with artwork dragon statue and everything. I would be really happy to hear the back compitble will be having the graphic update so I can dig up my disc from the bottom of the cupboard! :)</p>

<p>Since the remastered version is coming out, it probably won't be made backwards compatible. If it is made backwards compatible, it would just be the 360 version.</p>
