    <title>Reputation system needs to be looked at - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> celticsgreen17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reputation system needs to be looked at</h2>
                    
<p>Im really disappointed that I've been reported 5 times for cheating and my reputation has taken a hit this month. It is solely because players are annoyed about my skill in Player vs Player competitive matches. I play destiny pretty much exclusively, in
 Trials which is the most competitive. I help players that play with me and I get inundated with friend requests because I am labelled a chill player who has a lot of fun teaching other players how to improve.</p>
<p>The fact that Ive been accused of cheating 5 times is absolutely absurd. Im on a Fiber Optics connection so I never lag and I have never cheated at anything in my life. It is abundantly clear that the reputation system is severely flawed that players who
 lose a game can, out of frustration, anger, and lack of maturity, lower my reputation out of spite. This needs to be looked at strongly by the enforcement team because as an avid Xbox user if my reputation continues to fall I will certainly look to switch
 platforms.</p>
<p>This is coming from a guy that literally got sent an original Xbox with a signed business card from Steve Ballmer with Tshirts back in the day because I made local news for taking all my Xbox money that my brother and I saved over the summer and donated
 it to the 9/11 fund in 2001. So I have had a very strong attachment to the brand since I was a kid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have also served as an ambassador a few times to assist over the holiday season. I have absolutely zero tolerance for cheating and the fact that this has been taken into account with absolutely zero evidence and it can take a hit on my gamer card to where
 it says Reputation needs work is pretty upsetting. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller is not connecting to windows 10 PC via bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaiman_17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller is not connecting to windows 10 PC via bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>So recently I purchased an Xbox one controller (black) from Amazon for playing games on my windows 10 PC but I am
<strong>unable to make them connect in a wireless manner</strong> . Connecting via USB is fine. So naturally I did research and found out that firmware on controller may not be updated but since i don't own an Xbox console itself I found the alternative to
 update the firmware via Xbox app accessories and it says the controller is updated and
<strong>firmware version is 3.1.1221.0 </strong>. I am trying to connect it with my
<strong>USB Bluetooth (v2.0)</strong> and the problem is that it keeps asking for a pin when I try them to connect . After more surfing i found out that my Bluetooth version is maybe too old and<strong> Xbox one controller requires at least BT 4.0+ to connect
</strong>. Now I am not willing to spend more money on Xbox wireless adapter<em>(almost as expensive as a new controller)</em> and looking for
<strong>a way to connect it anyways</strong> , if it is possible . If not then please confirm is something else the problem or it is really the old BT dongle.</p>

<p>Hi Jaiman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question on connecting a controller wireless to a PC. You would need the wireless adapter, unless you want to connect wired. Here is a guide for connecting
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wireless controller to PC</a>. If you look at the picture make sure your controller is a bluetooth controller. If it is Bluetooth capable the plastic around the Xbox logo button (or home button) will be part of the whole face of the controller, and not the
 top part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hello Jaiman, it seems you will need to buy the xbox wireless adapter (thats the easy way) but as you said the problem is with your bluetooth version, not with your controller, you can always buy a bluetooh 4.0 usb dongle if it is cheaper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is a link to the xbox wireless adapter, its ony 24 bucks not 59&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/adapters/wireless-adapter-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/adapters/wireless-adapter-windows</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope it helps!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, you would have to reinstall them from the original CD or website you got it from.&nbsp; You won't have to pay for it again, just have to spend about 5 minutes to let it reinstall.</p>

<h2>            how to change vibration on xbox controller on windows</h2>
                    I have a wireless&nbsp;xbox 360 controller for windows and I am wondering how I can turn the vibration up. The game I am playing is&nbsp;not a games&nbsp;for windows (live) game&nbsp;but does&nbsp;support vibration and the controller does vibrate but not hard enough for my liking.
 Also if you know how to switch the controller of outside a live game could you also tell me.

<h2>            Skype 11.19.856.0 desktop  - Cannot dial number from keyboard in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>This new version is such a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot dial numbers on the dialpad from my keyboard, it simply does not react. In previous versions I could always dial numbers from the keyboard. What gives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, it takes 2 clicks to even get to the dialpad now. First I have to click "3 dots" and then Dialpad, once I am in the call in order to dial an extension, or a digit to get through the automated menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shouldn't Skype be intelligent enough to open the dialpad automatically and let me dial using a keyboard once I dialed a phone number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more info, I am running Win 10 on Dell XPS-15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>For the convenience of Skype users, the dial pad is now located beside your profile picture.

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to update the application? The latest version available as of the moment is version 12.4.676.0. Check Windows Store if there is any pending updates available for Skype. If there is, please update and re-launch the application. Let us know
 if the same issue persists, so we can look into it further. </p>

            So now I am back to the same problem. Windows updated Skype on its own. The stupid new version still cannot dial using the keyboard. Are you guys serious??? I am paying for phone service to you and you can't put such a basic feature into your fancy new
 version. What a joke.

<p>I don't want my "friends" to see I am on line!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't want Xbox to assign me a silly user name!</p>
<p>I never want to access Xbox for anything! </p>
<p>I don't want Xbox to use my bandwidth!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, if there's no way to stop Xbox connecting when I play a local game, I'll just throw the games out.</p>

<h2>            This page has an unspecified potential security risk.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked this issue up on multiple sites, and I've seen the same relative solutions, but none have worked for me, so I thought that I'd go to the source.</p>
<p>Here's the issue: I have a link in my taskbar to my My Documents folder, which, when I try to open it, I'm presented w/ this message:</p>
<p>This page has an unspecified potential security risk.&nbsp; Would you like to continue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I select yes, there are no problems, and my My Documents folder opens.&nbsp; However, it's a nuisance, and I'd like to stop this message from popping up every time.</p>
<p>As for my setup:</p>
<p>I'm running XP SP2 (w/ no intention of installing SP3) on my desktop system that I'm trying to access my My Documents directory from.&nbsp; I also have a file server, which I call USC, running Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS and housing a RAID 5 array and utilizing Samba.&nbsp;
 I have this array mapped to my desktop system as Y:.&nbsp; The path to my My Documents directory is Y:\backups\my_docs.&nbsp; Prior to a few days ago, I'd never had any issue regarding this topic.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of adding another RAID 5 array to this file server, and I've been having some problems w/ Samba.&nbsp; At one point, I removed this mapping, while I was testing various configurations.&nbsp; When I tried to to re-map it, I had problems connecting.&nbsp;
 Apparently, some of the changes I'd made now required me to connect to this share w/out providing login credentials.&nbsp; So, just to be clear, prior to this, I had this drive mapped and set to reconnect at logon, and there were no problems.&nbsp; If, for some reason,
 I ever needed to re-map it, all I had to do was provide my credentials, and it re-mapped w/out a problem.&nbsp; Now, when I map it, it doesn't ask for credentials, and it simply maps the share.</p>
<p>However, after all of this happened, when I now select the shortcut link to my My Documents directory, I receive this notification.&nbsp; I'd tried deleting and recreating the shortcut link, but that didn't help.&nbsp; As I'd previously mentioned, I'd read various
 other sites, and I tested a few solutions, most of them consisting of adding this share to the list of sites in my Local Intranet options w/in IE8.&nbsp; I even tried it under Trusted Sites.&nbsp; Nothing has resolved the issue.&nbsp; It was also recommended that I uncheck
 the Automatically Detect Intranet Network, which I did but to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, my IE8 setup is as follows:</p>
<p>Local Intranet is set to Medium-Low Security (I'd tried it at low, but that didn't work, either.)&nbsp; Automatically Detect Intranet Network is checked, and file://usc is added to the zone.</p>
<p>Trusted Sites is set to Medium Security, and I have no entries to its zone.</p>
<p>Any help w/ this issue would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<h2>            Delete Domain User Account After Log-Off or Reboot &#40;win10&#41;</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Hello guys,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is my first time posting on this blog and I hope my descriptions below would give you an idea on what I'm looking...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About our lab environment:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I work at a school with over 200 PC's that are being accessed by students 24/7. Each student access these PC's using their domain account. We use HP z820's, HP Z1, and HP Z440s all on Windows 10. These PC's are mainly used for Graphic Design such as
 3D Modeling/Rendering and largely used for the Adobe CC Suite.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I have done so far:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I modified the Default User Profile with custom settings and policies so that when a student logs in, they all have the same desktop with the same shortcuts and applications. Users are not able to modify settings install software unless allowed by
 an administrator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since there are a handful of students logging -in and out continuously on these PC’s; their profiles are eating up the SSD storage capacity. Students save projects over 5-15 Gigs. I have set Group Policy to Delete Profiles over “X” amount of days but
 that is not cutting it. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I’m looking for:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am looking for a way to delete user accounts after a log-off or restart, clearing all user account data to save space on the SSD or possibly a solution that works like DeepFreeze.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank You so much in advance!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Dan</span></p>

<p>I have a canon lide 25 and OS windows 7, all has worked fine until recently, and the only thing I can think I have done to chage things is connect an external hard drive, this error has appered since then.</p>
<p>"Cannot communicate with scanner,Cable may be disconnected or turned off. Check status. Scanner driver will be turned off." I click OK on this and then-</p>
<p>"Unable to open TWAIN source Please check connection Then restart tool box." comes up.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver from the canon website. I have chaged the usb port connection and I have even changed the path of the scanner and nothing has worked so far. Please can you suggest a fix.</p>

<h2>            4 GB Xbox 360 Update Problem</h2>
                    I turned on my 4GB black Xbox 360 yesterday (Saturday) as I was not home on Friday and upon console start-up I was prompted with a system update or be signed out of Xbox live. So I began with the update and the loading bar got almost full (I would say
 95%-98%) when an error message appeared saying something to the effect of "a problem has occurred while installing the update and the update will need to be re installed." I passed this off as nothing and did as the onscreen instructions said and again I was
 asked to update or be signed out of Xbox live. I did so and this time the update installed all the way. Then I got a message telling me to calibrate my Kinect. I did so. Then the calibration was finished and the Xbox start-up flashed and I was at the dashboard.
 I noticed that I was not signed in and went to my menu to select profiles and none were there!! There was absolutely no profiles saved on my Xbox.(They were saved on the 4 GB of memory in the Xbox system so not an external hard

<p>@ Enen.&nbsp; No, the paddles are metal.&nbsp;Steel if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>I'd be tempted to call support on that one. I'd say it shouldn't be happening. I don't use the plug &amp; play myself. Just have&nbsp;2 sets (4 total) of&nbsp;rechargeable AA batteries and swap them. I like them better. About the same price as the plug &amp; play,&nbsp;for 2 sets
 (Energizer 1400mah NIMH)&nbsp;and they've lasted over 2 years now.</p>

<p>Bought from game in UK. &nbsp;And the paddles are of a metal alloy material by the looks of it. &nbsp;It don't do it with batteries in &nbsp;just with the lead. The only thing I could think of is as they lock in with magnets n having a constant charge that they &nbsp;are storing
 and conducting static with the constant bashing . Would be nice if there was hard plastic

<p><span>Hi mugsy101,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>
 Disconnect all the external devices, mainly USB devices except for the basic devices like mouse and the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 2: Boot the computer in safe mode:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the
 Boot Menu appears. </span></p>
<p>
<span>b. Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>c. When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also, check with the other modes under Windows Advanced Options menu (try last known good configuration, safe mode with command……)</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the problem continues after you start the computer in safe mode,
 there is a problem with faulty hardware \ with a driver that is installed\ an operating system component</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>If the computer boots in safe mode, try the following steps else, go to step 3.</span></strong></p>

            If you can't get into safe mode (you get the same errors) and the system doesn't have a system restore option from the recovery menu, then proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates. To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make
 the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD {<span>you'll obviously need to do this on another computer)</span><span>.</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking - or use the Command Prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to identify the corrupted files causing the problem.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer - if using Command Prompt type eventvwr and enter)..&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a></span><span>.<br />
<p><span><br />
If that doesn't work, then I'm aftraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix
</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk with
 the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...<br />
<br />
I certainly hope one of the earlier recommendations works because a clean install is a time-consuming process and sometimes you aren't able to bring the system back into its former shape because you may have lost some programs or for other reasons.&nbsp; But it
 will almost certainly fix the main problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Hennie2710, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’m sorry to know that you are facing issues to perform Windows 8 installation. It would be grateful</span><span> if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</span></p>
<p>1. How are you trying to install Windows 8? Are you using a burned media or download and saved a setup file on your system?</p>
<p>2. Are you trying to perform an upgrade installation of Windows 8 pro from Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>If you are performing an Upgrade installation from Windows 7, then try the following steps and check if you can proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Before starting the Upgrade installation, you may try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Unplug the external devices connected to the system, except the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>You may perform a clean boot on Windows 7 system and try to perform the Upgrade installation.</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</p>
<p>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p><span>You may also go to the following locations to delete the folders</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on the "Start" menu, and then select "Run", which will bring up a command box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type the word "temp" into the text area, and click "OK" to confirm. </span>
</p>
<p><span>c. In C:\WINDOWS\temp, press the keys "<b>Ctrl", and "A</b>” to select all files and delete the same</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>You can also perform a Hardware Clean boot to disable the devices and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>a. Click on <b>Start</b> and in Start search type in "<b>Device Manager</b>".</p>
<p>b. In Device Manager, disable the items in <b>Display Adapter, Floppy disk drive, Network Adapter, Modem and Sound, Video &amp; Game Controllers</b>.</p>
<p>c. Right click on each of the devices and select <b>Disable</b>.</p>
<p>After disabling the devices and third party programs check if you are able to install Windows 8.</p>
<p>Once you have upgraded to Windows 8 enable the devices. Also refer to the computer manufacturer website and install the latest version of Windows 8 drivers for all the devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 5:</span></p>
<p>Uninstall any third party security software installed on the system</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you have the security software setup files or a disk to install this later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 6:</p>
<p>If the issue persist, you may also try to download and run the System Update Readiness Tool.</p>
<p>You may refer the article to download the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Update Readiness Tool fixes Windows Update errors in Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008</a></p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that Microsoft account is corrupted, to verify, log in with another Microsoft account and check is the issue remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible reason is wrong Feedback and diagnostic settings. To change these settings:</p>
<p>1. Open Settings</p>
<p>2. Go to Privacy/Feedback &amp; diagnostics</p>
<p>3. If the Diagnostics and usages data settings are set to Basic, change it to Enhanced or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does ones account be corrupted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've logged in to my other account and that synced over the them on to both my desktop and my surface.</p>
<p>The only difference i can see is, that there is a theme saved for synchronising but not on my main account.</p>
<p>So how do I get a theme saved to synchronised?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
