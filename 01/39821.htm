                    <p>Windows 10 has cost me two computers that will no longer boot, countless hours of wasted productivity trying to keep things running and now a third is on it's way out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Update behaves like malware.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can't be turned off and it runs without permission. I've tried stopping the update service and set it to manual - and it still runs the next time I reboot! Tell me Microsoft, what is your definition of malware?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no choice when I go to shut down my computer (I have to update) but if I don't shut down my computer, it updates when I'm not at the computer. Except, wait, I come back to a failed update - usually a black screen or a frozen screen somewhere around
 80%. It will eventually restore previous version but it seems to have to fail 3 times minimum - which can take hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 workstations that are cough/cough/puke "running" Windows 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Two of them were upgraded from Windows 8 (who wouldn't want to get out of that train wreck??). When I started running into this issue with Windows Update failing, I had Windows 10 installed clean on each of them. Already hours of wasted time, then even more
 to setup the computers again so we can continue with that work I mentioned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time, one does not boot at all - after Windows Update repeatedly ran even when all configuration said it should not run - and after 4 hours spent on the phone with support and absolutely no way to get it working again, short of installing a new
 motherboard. The second is now experiencing the same issues. Down 2 otherwise perfectly operational machines so far.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third machine is now at risk - similar symptoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there's the continuous networking nightmare. I spend hours to set up a peer-to-peer network (hours you might ask? I'm wondering why it's so hard too). But one of the three machines can't see one of the others. Until after the weekend - then miraculously
 it can see the third machine (with no change being made) but the second computer now can't see that third one. And after a week of working fine, the first machine now can't see that third one anymore no matter what I do. The second computer is now down for
 the count. I mean, hello? It's not rocket science. It was easier and far more consistent to setup peer to peer networking with Windows 3.1.&nbsp; It's totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tell me, how do I get compensation? I calculate that over the past year, I've wasted at least 100 hours in trouble shooting, researching, waiting for computers to be reinstalled, reconfiguring them and looking for a solution that doesn't involve Microsoft.&nbsp;
 At my normal charge out rate, Microsoft has caused me to lose $12,500 CDN - that's over $200 per week.&nbsp; Small potatoes for a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am down 2 computers with one on the way the same direction. That would be at least $3000 plus more time to re-configure the new machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on you Microsoft. </p>

<p>You need to rethink what you're doing. Ars Technica is reporting that the Fall Creators Update is installed on 85% of Windows 10 PCs. That beats v.1703, which was only installed on 75% of Windows 10 PCs when the FCU (v.1709) was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That puts you in an increasingly small minority of Windows 10 users that can't seem to get it together. It's time for you to join the rest of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your hardware is supported on Windows 10, or is otherwise known to work well with Windows 10, here's what to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Backup all your personal files. Don't forget anything!</p>
<p>2- Do a clean install of Windows 10. Going forward it's all about the install, so this is something you must get right.</p>
<p>3- Run Windows Update until your computer is completely up to date. That will take a few hours.</p>
<p>4- Restore your backed up personal data.</p>
<p>5- Reinstall your apps. You'll have the best results with software versions that are supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going forward, don't make any changes to your configuration settings until you've done the research on the internet, so you know that you're doing the right thing and in the right way. Forget about what you used to do in older versions of Windows. Windows
 10 is different.</p>

<h2>            Why is DriverUpdate from Slimware being installed on my computer without my knowledge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm not aware that I've ever agreed to have DriverUpdate installed at any point. I remove DriverUpdate via Control Panel, but sooner or later, it installs itself again--what a pain! If anyone knows how this annoying software keeps infiltrating and installing
 itself without permission, I would love to know. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Most likely.&nbsp; I see a version of it is being pushed out as an add-in to freeware.&nbsp; This is common and justified by freeware vendors as a way to cover their costs of providing you the software free.&nbsp; It makes it especially important to watch every screen
 like a hawk when installing freeware, even the License Agreement.&nbsp; There may be tricky checkbox choices or ways to opt out.&nbsp; Don't let a single screen pass without reading every word.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now you can download and install&nbsp; <a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes Free Version</a>&nbsp; and especially <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AdwCleaner Download</a>&nbsp; to run scans.&nbsp; Make sure they clean up everything found completely including needed restarts.&nbsp; When AdwCleaner goes to clean up what it finds, it will pop up a tutorial to go over the ways to avoid adware sneaks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I think the free version of SlimDrivers is one of the better driver finders, which I myself sometimes use on older PC's with hard to find drivers.&nbsp; Otherwise Windows is pretty good about finding drivers itself, and if you have a factory install there should
 be drivers to compare on the PC's Support Downloads webpage first.&nbsp; What makes SlimDrivers sketchy is being pushed by freeware vendors like that, especially including their cleaner which I've always avoided since CCleaner works better and none is really needed
 in Windows 10 which has built-in maintenance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.&nbsp; I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.&nbsp;

    <title>Skype Call Automatically Hangs Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aimee serrano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Call Automatically Hangs Up</h2>
                    Hello everyone. I have a question about Skype calls. Recenly, something weird has been happening while I'm on a call. While I'm on an active Skype call on my mobile device and somebody else calls me not on the application Skype, but on my regular phone
 number the Skype call automatically hangs up, even though I did not accept the incoming phone call. Does anybody know why this constantly keeps happening? Before all of this, whenever I got a phone call while I was on a Skype call, the Skype call would pause
 and then it would resume after the other call was over. Is there a possibility that this could have been a new update? Is there a way I can fix this? Thank you for reading. I'm sorry if what I wrote does not make any sense. I don't know how to phrase this
 properly.&nbsp;

<p>Same is happening for me on the Lite version. Skype call automatically terminates when I get a "normal" incoming call. I always use my bluetooth headset with Skype (hence I use the Lite version since the normal doesn't work with BT headsets), if that has
 anything to do with the issue, dunno. Skype just seems to act crazy with BT headsets. Let me know if I can help in any way. Details below.</p>

<p>Android 6.0.1</p>
<p>Skype Lite 1.60.76.31339</p>
<p>BT headset: Jaybird X3</p>

            I have been chatting with the Skype Team about this issue. For the benefit of other users, here's what was said: First they said that it's normal that the call automatically hangs up since the phone prioritizes regular calls first. I was arguing against
 that statement. They would keep an eye at the issue and collect more data and work on the issue. They seemed to be sincere about it. We'll wait and see if the planted seed will sprout.&nbsp;

    <title>Unable to boot HP Pavillion G6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anisarahim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to boot HP Pavillion G6</h2>
                    <p>My mum's laptop got knocked off the sofa recently and ever since then it's been unable to boot. It had worked fine the night before the tumble, but not after it. She's got a HP Pavillion G6 that runs Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you switch the laptop on it displays the Microsoft loading screen before switching to a blue screen with the something along the lines of "there's something wrong with your laptop, we'll try to restart etc... unmountable boot volume". Then the laptop
 proceeds to "preparing automatic repair" screen for a few minutes before ultimately displaying a black screen where you can only see the cursor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching online for various fixes I tried to do a clean install of windows 10 from a USB, however when on the startup options and I selected the USB from the BIOS options, it once again loaded the Microsoft loading screen before proceeding to an empty
 blue screen.<br />
My next option was to try a system recovery. One method I tried was from the startup options when I pressed the esc key, however that didn't work as pressing f11 for system recovery did nothing. My next method was restarting the laptop, and holding down f11
 simultaneously with the power button. This caused the laptop to beep loudly for a minute or so before becoming stuck on the HP loading screen with the words "F11... System Recovery" in the bottom left hand corner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix the laptop as it was perfectly fine one day but not the next? Or should I take it a tech specialist?
</p>

            When your mum's laptop fell. The hard drive inside the laptop must have had experienced a "head crash". Hard drives have physical moving platters. And when your mum's laptop fell, a platter must have had crashed into the read-write head (which reads and
 writes data on the platters of coarse). Windows won't start because it is stored on the hard drive. A hard drive replacement would be the right way to go. Just make sure it is the right size and connection type for your laptop. The amount of hard drive space
 will be up to you. Also, this would require you to know how to access the hard drive. Good luck!

<br />That model does have a SIM slot however for that to work there must also be a HDSPA Mobile Broadband card installed, and that is only installed on some versions of that laptop
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)

<br />Expand the Network Adapters section
<br />
<br />Do you see wither of these devices listed there?

<br />
<br />Do you not see a WWAN device or any other device in that section?
<br />
<br />If not, that does not have the radio required (4G LTE) for the SIM card you would need to purchase that and fit it into that laptop, they are available from $20 on the Internet . . .

<br />
<br />Excellent, that means you do have a WWAN card . . 
<br />
<br />The SIM you are inserting into your laptop - is that a DATA plan SIM card, you cannot use a standard SIM card from your Phone?

            Hi rastamani
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager again
<br />
<br />Expand the Network Adapters section
<br />
<br />Does that Ericsson device has an exclamation mark beside it or does it look like it is properly installed?
<br />
<br />Right click that device and choose Properties, on the drivers tab of the resulting dialog, is it reported that it is installed correctly&gt;
<br />
<br />If so, you then need a SIM only Mobile broadband deal, you cannot use a SIM card from a Mobile Phone in that laptop, it will not show up or work . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 &#58; Can run Sysprep to capture image but can&#39;t re-image to new computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fresh installed the Windows 10 1607 on a technician computer, disabled the Windows Update service, install some more apps and tried to run sysprep to capture the fresh image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to run sysprep and capture the fresh image on to WDS server. When I tried to re-image on new computer, it ended up with the error message: "Windows could not finish configuring the system. To attempt to resume configuration, restart the computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then pressed SHIFT-F10 to get into command prompt, typed MMC and add the Computer Management. changed the password for built-in administrator, enabled it as well. Then restart the computer, I have received the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SHIFT-F10 again, change to directory OOBE, typed msoobe and enter, the system then got into the stage where I can see the "Hi there. Let's get a few basic things out of the way"..... Then selected all the correct settings, click Next. "Here is the legal
 stuff", click "Accept", then at "Get going fast". click "Use Express Settings" (have also tried with "Customize" option), it ended up with the spinning dots and "Just a moment" message and kept running for more than 2 days (run during the weekend) without
 further progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what is exact&nbsp;issue here and how to get it resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            How does one remove Windows Hello - REMOVE is not a provided option</h2>
                    How does one remove the Windows Hello feature in Windows 10 Pro version 1803? The remove radio button cited in multiple posts is NOT shown in ACCOUNTS &gt;&gt;&gt; SIGN IN OPTIONS. A software vendor believes that Windows Hello is the reason that the software /
 middleware will not install on the computer (notebook). I'd appreciate having a way to remove it and see if this is really the issue.

            Hi Richard,
<br />
<br />You are correct, the option was available in an older version of Windows 10, but no longer is available . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below and go to 'Option Two' on that page
<br />
<br />They provide a simple reg file that will turn off Windows Hello, follow the steps in Option two . .

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />Do you have full Administrator privileges? 
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 
<br />
<br />You can also try uninstalling the camera from Device Manager and see if that helps.

            Make sure you have the latest video drivers for your card and that you are running at the monitor's native resolution. You can find out the monitor's native resolution by either looking in its manual or doing a Google using a search term like, "monitor
 make/model native resolution". Change the display resolution:<br />
<br />
1. Start Orb&gt;Control Panel&gt;Appearance and Personalization. Click Personalization and then click Display Settings.<br />
2. Under Resolution, move the slider to the resolution you want and then click Apply.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Get the drivers from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://www.gtopala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gtopala.com/</a> - System Information for Windows<br />
<br />
If updating the drivers doesn't help and you are already running at the correct resolution, attach the computer to a different, known-working monitor. If the problem doesn't occur, the first monitor is probably failing. They don't last forever. If the same
 problems occur, the video card is probably failing. Swap it out for a known-working one to test.

                    <p>My Acer Aspire T180 came with Vista installed on it.....according to the Acer webpage this model computer was designed to run with Vista as the OS. When Windows came out I ran compatibility check and that came back stating it was ok to upgrade to Windows
 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting the BSOD with this: IRQL Less Than or Not Equal To</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this article from https://www.easeus.com/backup-recovery/fix-irql-not-less-or-equal-error-in-windows-10/8/7, authored by Traci King date Jul 01, 2016. This article shows 5 methods to fix this problem and get your computer out of BSOD problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this computer ok to run Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I have a BIOS problem as well as it was designed to run VISTA?</p>

            Hi Stanley, this is more than likely caused by a device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            The crash was caused by memory corruption.
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<p>Right click an empty part of your desktop and go for Screen resolution. My guess is that you have tried adjusting the resolution here with the dropdown box/slider but cannot find the one that you want. So, click Advanced settings (over to the right). Then
 click the 'List All Modes' button. Is your resolution and colour depth listed there? If it is then select it, but if not click Cancel and then click the Monitor tab. If the 'Hide modes that this monitor cannot display' is ticked, then untick it and click Apply.
 Go back to the Adaptor tab (click it) and try the 'List All Modes' button again.</p>
<p>Assuming that you are using a flat screen you should really try setting resolution to&nbsp;the native resolution of your screen, or at least keep the same x:y pixel ratio.</p>
<p>Please mark this as helpful or answered if appropriate.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<h2>            Getting a permissions error when trying to access advanced sound settings</h2>
                    <p>When I try to access the advanced sound settings menu in the themes area of personalization, I get an error messages that reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious if this has to do with a bad install of Windows 10. I upgraded from Windows 8 on a computer I purchased that came with it.</p>

</p><p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the issue persists with other files/folders/devices/paths also?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. This issue can occur if any of the following scenarios exist on your PC.<br />
•You do not have permissions to the file or the file location.<br />
•The file is on a location that is not currently accessible like a network location or an external drive that is not currently connected to the PC.<br />
•The file has been moved or deleted.<br />
•The file or shortcut is corrupt.<br />
•The file may be blocked by Windows.<br />
•Your antivirus software may be blocking the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. We think that this is a permission related issue. Please follow the below methods to troubleshoot.</p>

</p><p>Please follow through. First log into your admin account and follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Windows Explorer, right-click the file or folder you want to work with.</p>
<p>2. From the pop-up menu, select Properties, and then in the Properties dialog box click the Security tab.</p>
<p>3. In the Name list box, select the user, contact, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view. If the permissions are dimmed, it means the permissions are inherited from a parent object.<br />
&nbsp;Turn off UAC (User Account Control)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you can do anything, you must turn off the UAC, or you will be locked out of the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts<br />
2) Click "Change User Account Control Settings"<br />
3) Move slider all the way down to "Never Notify"<br />
4) Reboot</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Fix Permissions</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you own the files, you have to give yourself permission to modify them</p>
<p>1) Right Click on Program Files -&gt; Properties -&gt; Security Tab<br />
2) Click Advanced -&gt; Change Permission<br />
3) Select Administrators (any entry) -&gt; Edit<br />
4) Change the Apply To drop down box to This Folder, Subfolder &amp; Files<br />
5) Put check in Full Control under Allow column -&gt; OK -&gt; Apply<br />
6) Wait some more.....<br />
7) When it finishes, the dialog boxes may hide behind the Explorer window. Minimize it and click OK on all the the dialog boxes<br />
8) Reboot PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, please opt for method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure that the file location is available and not missing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, please opt for the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if your antivirus is blocking the file. if it is blocking then please add an exception while running the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know if the issue got resolved or you need any further assistance.</span></p>

            Then your Windows update is fine.You might have to keep your PC on for more than this even for a whole night.Windows update servers seems to have prioritized Windows 10 rather than Windows 7 updates.If it still does not help, reply back.

<h2>            Problems with adding new parent account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody, my brother just removed his account as parent from mine. &nbsp;I need to add a new one before I can play online. &nbsp;Before I sign in, I get a message saying I need a new parent, as it should, but every time i try to add a parent my Xbox either gives
 me a message saying that The Xbox live sign up is currently&nbsp;unavailable or I get an error code of&nbsp;<span>80151901 which i'm pretty sure is something about a profile problem, although that does not appear anymore. &nbsp;Also, I cannot access&nbsp;the My Account page on
 this website as I always get runtime errors. It's been at this for about three days so far.</span></p>
<p><span>So my question is, Is this problem from Xbox and Microsoft services just being down, or does my profile just have a problem? &nbsp;</span></p>

            DreamScene is not part of Windows 7 nor is it available for it. It was always buggy and I suppose that's why MS didn't include it in Win7.
