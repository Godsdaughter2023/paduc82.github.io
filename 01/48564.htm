<h2>            Windows 10 internet connection symbol- there is any way to change the symbol at the bottom back to the 5 bar display rather than this 3 bar display</h2>
                    <p>On the task bar in windows ten the symbol for internet connection is 3 curved bars. This can be deceiving. For example it says you have 3/3 bars which i associate with having full connection but if you go to wireless network connection status it can say
 that you actually have 3 or 4 out of 5, the same can be said when it says you have 2/3 bars which i associate with 3/4 bars out of 5. But when i checked it was 2/5 on the connection status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is if there is ANY way to change the symbol at the bottom back to the 5 bar display rather than this 3 bar display. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Ghost Recon Wildlands Achievements Not Unlocking Issue</h2>
                    <p>Well, I have this issue for a long time, from a month later of the game's release, some of my achievements are not unlocking. I have tried to contact ubisoft, they said that they can't help, then contacted xbox support and gave me some basic troubleshooting steps but the problem still remained. I even used this following thread : https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/8a46e4e2-6891-480a-873b-afb962a99642 , but it also didn't work. I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong to not unlock them. The achievements are the following: The Whole Story , Mission Master , Legendary Hunter , Heavy Medals.</p>

<p>Hey there thanks for posting this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost the exact same thing happened to myself and my coworker. I have an xbox one s and played Woodlands every damn day after work and beat it in about a month. I am super anal and ocd about games and take my Achievements very seriously since it is a feature
 your supposed to be able to take advantage of when you spend hundreds of dollars on the system! Anyways, I collected everything in the game as I went and 100% every mission and everything I could, and I had like 14 achievements that didn't unlock or pop. 3
 I finally got to somehow, but 11 of them to this day haven't changed. Exact same thing happened to my coworker on PlayStation. Now I don't care who's problem it is but it is total BS that Ubisoft nor Microsoft accept responsibility or have supported a fix
 for the issue to this day! I have called, emailed and posted to both companies and neither have suggested a fix. I know that someone at microsoft works in the Achievements section and could simply sign into my xbox live account, see that everything I've stated
 is true and credit my gamerscore for those achievements or fix it. I refuse to spend countless hundreds of hours playing the game all over again. It was a great game up to that point, now I'll never purchase another ubisoft or microsoft product again until
 they give me a solution. It is rediculous! If anyone reads this and knows of a fix or would like to discuss how this happened to them please reach out to me via email so I can further contact these companies, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had it with these companies not supporting their fans and reaching some sort of agreement on responsibility and a solution. Please contact them too if you can. I'll start a class action lawsuit soon if they don't pull their heads from their asses
 and deliver on what were supposed to be getting as a paid customer. It infuriates me. Yes it's just a gamerscore but that is not the point. The point is it is an option for you to play a certain way to unlock said achievements and an option that the companies
 stand by but do nothing if a problem arises.</p>
<p>Let's get to the bottom of this already!</p>

<h2>            nvlddmkm not added in system32&#47;drivers folder after graphics installations.</h2>
                    Windows 10 is failing to make this service driver known after graphics adapter installations. Also, when I install/update graphics adapter drivers, the&nbsp;nvlddmkm.sys driver is not being replace in the system32/drivers folder. I see this message generated
 in Device Manager/Properties/Events when driver nvlddmkm is added:&nbsp;Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service nvlddmkm for Device Instance ID PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_1187&amp;SUBSYS_27653842&amp;REV_A1\4&amp;14E8F4CB&amp;0&amp;0010 with the following status: 0. Which,
 after being installed Event Viewer shows the following warning message: Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered. Happens mostly while gaming, viewing videos on Microsoft Edge, or using media player such as VLC player. After
 some time, when I start to play a game I get critical message stating:&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 have features that are not working properly, we suggest that you run the System File Checker tool and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool to scan and correct any issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating
 system. SFC checks for system file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.<br />
<br />
Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)"> ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</a> to perform SFC and DISM:

Run SFC and DISM.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you contact your manufacturer if your graphic card is compatible with Windows 10 and to have compatible driver.

            You can no longer login to Skype via Facebook as of January 2018. All Skype logins have been streamlined to Microsoft accounts, allowing you to login with a single sign-in, unlocking all your Microsoft services – including Skype, Office Online, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and more – in one experience, with just one password. To continue using Skype, either create a new Microsoft account or sign in with an existing Microsoft account if you already have one. 
<br />Do you have an email address that you use to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Xbox, Office Online, OneDrive, Outlook.com, or Windows?
<br />
<br />    Yes. Great - that same email can be used to sign in to Skype!
<br />     
<br />    No. No problem, go to our Create an account (<a href="https://login.skype.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.skype.com/join</a>) page and we'll walk you through creating a new Microsoft account that you can use to sign in to Skype and other Microsoft services.

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have an Apple Laptop but use the Parallels program to run Windows. &nbsp;When I turn on Windows and run a Windows program, the keyboard begins to malfunction. &nbsp;For example, when I want to type a simple name, different keyboard shortcuts somehow activate.
 &nbsp;If I type an "r", the RUN program comes up. &nbsp;If I type an 'm" all windows are minimized. &nbsp;These appear to be the Windows Natural Keyboard shortcuts that are activating with other keys pushed in succession. &nbsp;Simply typing a letter activates a shortcut. &nbsp;I
 have tried re-starting the computer and this does not turn off the problem. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>            Skate 3 - Isnt working on XBOX ONE - no news anywhere</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>Skate 3 still isnt working on the XBOX ONE. The BC Page states its coming soon... well since November.</p>
<p>How long is soon for you ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were here at&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>&nbsp;</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Forums Home</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Support</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Xbox
 One Support</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>001 - Backward Compatibility&nbsp;arent we ?</span></p>
<p>This is the right place to ask isnt it ? It is a Support Forum where you should get help isnt it ? Skate3 supposedly comes to BC isnt it ?</p>
<p>We have a right to know if we got our money taken for nothing, arent we ?</p>
<p>If nothing changes on that BC page it is false Advertisment and noone gave a satisfying answer in the last threads. To point us to the&nbsp;<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backwards-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backwards-compatibility</a>&nbsp;is
 just rude. On the Skate3 pages are over 24000 comments and no anser at all, not even a reaction or apology nothing.</p>
<p>To say we have to make our voice heard there is the worst i have experienced from MS. Never had i such an unprofessionel response from anyone at such a huge company that supposedly treats their customers right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant even get the right words, so frustrating and unbelievable. im furious.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately there is no timeline as to when Skate 3 will be released for backwards compatibility on Xbox One. There was never actually a release date for it when they announced it was coming soon. Hopefully we will see it soon :)</p>

    <title>Secure Socket Tunnelling Protocol Service cannot start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris vds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Secure Socket Tunnelling Protocol Service cannot start</h2>
                    I'm having problems with my mobile broadband since the Dec 2011 updates cycle.<br />
<br />
Hardware: ASUS F6VE laptop, core2duo, 4 gig ram, ATI graphics<br />
OS: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit SP1 completely updated to Dec 2011. This install was originally Vista Home Premium 32bit and upgraded to Win7.<br />
AV:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
<br />
The symptoms:<br />
<br />
Error 711:" The operation could not finish because it could not start the Remote Access Connection Service manager in time."<br />
Rasman cannot start because Secure Socket Tunnelling Protocol service cannot start.<br />
<br />
The system log is now filling up with:<br />
<br />
7001: "The Remote Access Connection Manager service depends on the Secure Socket Tunnelling Protocol Service service which failed to start because of the following error:
<br />
The operation completed successfully."<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
7036: "The Secure Socket Tunnelling Protocol Service service entered the stopped state."<br />
<br />
Attempting to open the properties of the dialup adaptor gives an error dialog box:<br />
Title:"Network Connections"; Message:"An unexpected error occurred." Removing the existing connections and trying to reinstall the modem made no difference.<br />
<br />
The issue is specific to the dial up / mobile broadband though as the Ethernet still works fine. The mobile broadband stopped working when I let the December 2011 Windows Updates install. It was fine till then - I'd been using it all day before applying the
 updates that night. The only odd thing that I will say is that for a few weeks now, occasionally Windows would occasionally not detect the display, keyboard and track pad on first boot, but restarting generally was successful. Then just when I started up the
 PC to download the hot fixes, the Windows detected "new hardware" and reloaded drivers for the ACPI x86 based PC (i.e. the HAL driver) and a few others that I wasn't quick enough to note. I've never seen that happen before, but now the hardware is being set
 up correctly each boot and seems to behave apart from SSTP service is broken.<br />
<br />
Rolling back to a previous restore point did not fix it, nor did uninstalling the hotfixes.<br />
<br />
I've tried pretty much every fix that I have been able to find and none are successful.<br />
The "fix" by removing sstpsvc as a dependency in the RasMan registry key was unsuccessful.<br />
The "fix" by deleting the contents of %system32%\Logfiles\WMI and %system32%\Logfiles\WMI\RtBackup was unsuccessful<br />
The "fix" by reregistering netshell.dll and ole32.dll successfully registered for the former, but not ole32.dll. The problem was not fixed.<br />
<br />
"sfc /scannow" only finds the autochk.exe hash issue, which has been a present for some time.<br />
<br />
I will mention that I had VMWare Workstation 7.1.4 installed. I tried to uninstall it a while back, but it broke another program that I need - probably something to do with the sentinel driver. I have now uninstalled VMWare and reset the TCP/IP stack without
 issue. The problem was not fixed though.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to reinstall as it's taken me quite some time to get it set up as I want it<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - my experience with Dock and Micro SD Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to share my experience with the Surface Pro 3 and this may help others with similar problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have owned my SP3 for almost 2 years and am overall very happy with the unit. The problems I have had were with the first Docking Station. The Ethernet port would never work or work very slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacted MS Support and was sent a new docking station replacement. This unit had the same problems.</p>
<p>This was then replaced by MS with the NEW Dock - still issues with a very slow internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Decided to look around and after months of searching on google I found a Vrova Docking station. Readily available in Australia and reasonably priced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the Vrova at home, plugged it in and everything now works like a charm. Fast internet, great USB ports and easy to set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just added a Samsung EVO 256Gb Micro SD card for my data storage. Used a 128Gb but started to run out of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I had the 128GB plugged in with both the MS docking Station and the Dock the SD card kept unplugging itself and restarting again. This problem was also solved with the Vrova.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I'm just confirming that the Vrova docking station and the Samsung EVO both work well with my MS SP3 Pro</p>
<p>Hope this was of some help to other with these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Murray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking from my end, it seems that SmartAssembly is an obfuscator that helps protect your application against reverse-engineering or modification. It could be that this tool is used by the current app that you're using or other apps in your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you perform a clean boot, and then check the status of the issue. If the issue persists, check Programs &amp; features and check if it is a program that you can uninstall. Below are articles for your reference:</p>

            Hi Peter,<br />
<br />
Changing the keyboard settings can be done thru Keyboard Properties. Windows10 doesn't have settings to adjust keyboard de-bounce. You may search for a 3rd-party program that may adjust keyboard debouncing.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help.<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A theme is a combination of desktop background pictures, window colors, and sounds. Which version of Windows 10 are you using? Is it the Anniversary Update or the Creators Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re using Windows 10 version 1607, you can follow the steps below to create a backup of your Theme with your preferred name:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Select Personalization, then click Themes.</li><li>Under Themes, click Theme settings.</li><li>A new window will pop up.</li><li>Choose the Theme you want to copy and click Save theme.</li><li>Enter your preferred theme name.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 Miracast, No repeated keystrokes with keyboards connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t.o.l.a.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Miracast, No repeated keystrokes with keyboards connected to miracast device.</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the Miracast more and more often but one of the issues that have been bothering me was the fact that repeated keystrokes don't work on the monitor, computer, or laptop that's being projected to.<br />
<br />
Usually this is just a small nuisance when it comes to my occasional writing as I can't just hold backspace to delete something. But when it comes to gaming, I have to connect it to the original computer other wise it's pretty much useless which in a lot of
 cases creates a really messy desk. And while there are solutions like Steam's in home streaming, I'd prefer to use Miracast because I won't need a router or hotspot for it to work making it convent as just press and play.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I'm not sure if this is necessary as I've had the same issue with other devices, but my hardware is the GPD Win 2 as the host computer paired up with the HP Elite x3 Lap Dock.</p>

            Hi T.O.L.A,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to recreate your issue but I'd need more details from you so I can isolate and further check for a more established workaround.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation. Type winver into the Cortana search box, then hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Has this been the case ever since, or did this just recently started acting up after some changes were made?<br />
<br />
Will keep an eye out for your response.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

                    <p>I am having some difficulty successfully performing a clean install. I have booted from the installation media, and after hitting install now, I agree, and Custom installation I hit a roadblock. I am where I want to install windows and only given
 one option: Drive 0 unallocated space. Total size: 0.0 MB. Free size: 0.0 MB. I get a message that says Windows can’t be installed on this drive due to the fact that it is not 9271 mb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The following buttons are grayed out: Delete, Format, Extend, and Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hit the New button I am told that the size must be at most 0 MB. The Load Driver button says I need to insert the installation media containing the driver files, then says there are no signed device drivers found. Finally, the Refresh button
 makes the “Drive 0 unallocated space” drive disappear, and causes my computer to begin clicking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was writing this up, at one point I got a BSOD &nbsp;with the stopcode of “DRIVER PNP WATCHDOG” This causes the computer to reboot. I have noticed this happens when I am not active on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Dell Inspiron 17 5000 series.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Hi Michael, it sounds like the Installation media is corrupt, the installation process should never look for a device driver during the installation . . .
<br />
<br />You should try re-creating the installation on another working PC . .

<p>Hi Tom, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Surface Type Cover may stop working if the keyboard driver is out of date or corrupted.
<span>In many cases, downloading and installing the latest updates for Windows and your Surface help resolves this issue.
</span><span>Click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> on how you can install the latest updates. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are some solutions you may also try:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restart Surface.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restart (don't shut down) your Surface. Select the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>button, then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Power</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Restart</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Detach and reattach the Type Cover. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Unplug your Surface and detach the Cover.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. (Use 95% or stronger isopropyl alcohol if possible.) Rub the cotton swab back and forth over the six circular magnets on the Type Cover's connector. After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that no cotton
 fibers remain on the connector. Then clean the connector on your Surface.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reattach the Cover, making sure that all the magnets touch the bottom edge of your Surface.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reinstall the Surface Cover driver.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>device manager</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the results.</li><li>Expand<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>Right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Uninstall</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your Surface. It'll automatically download and install the Surface Cover driver the next time you connect to the Internet.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Force shutdown your Surface device.</strong></p>

<h2>            There is an issue with my Xbox One club</h2>
                    <p>The issue is that my member count goes up but my follower count doesn't. Only 1 out of every 2 people that join increase the follower count. So I end up with 24 members and only 12 followers. I know people are not unfollowing the club, because I check just after someone joins and the member goes up but the followers doesn't. I also asked my friend who confirmed the club showed up as followed for him.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sometimes when inviting people, I get an error message 0x8019ffff, and I must invite a second time. I don't know if this issue is to do with my account, or my club. I haven't tested this with other clubs, however once my friend invited me to a club and he had to invite me three times for it to work, and sometimes people get kicked from my club shortly after. This issue started only after 9 members had joined the club. Since then, 1 out of every 2 members have not been added as a follower.</p>

    <title>No Audio on Skype calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sg_10  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio on Skype calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi Skype guys,</p>
<p>please can you tell me why the above is happening to my pc Windows Vista after a new version of Skype was installed the other day automatically??
</p>
<p>I was on Version 7.29 (and all was fine) and now I am on 7.36 and it hasn't worked since. I cannot hear and I cannot be heard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: Is my audio ok?</p>
<p>A: - Yes. On Skype/audio settings, when I test the mike and the speakers: I can see the mike reacts when I speak; I can hear the ringtone, so speakers are ok too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: Echo test call tried?</p>
<p>A: I cannot hear any voice when I ring, but I hear the sound of the initial ringtone when calling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: Did I try to uninstall and install again from your website?</p>
<p>A: Yes, &nbsp;version 7.36 gets installed&nbsp;and I get always the same audio problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have heard that someone solved the same problem by getting version 7.37 as an automatic update of Skype to this version 7.36, one of those the system gets overnight without you doing anything, which doesn't seem to be happening to mine yet.</p>
<p>How do I get that one, just to see if this fixes it for me too?? When &nbsp;I try to download the 7.37, it looks as if it starts downloading and then says "Problem with installation" and it directs me to the problematic one of 7.36. I must have uninstalled and
 installed skypes 15 times over the past week. Quite fed up!</p>
<p>Do you have any idea of how to solve this problem??</p>

<p>I just encountered this issue today on my Windows Vista machine. I have not used Skype in a while, but needed it for a quick video call. Since my version was old, Skype forced me to update, and installed 7.36. Apparently, 7.36 is the last build that supports
 Windows XP and Vista. Newer builds crash on startup due to missing a missing function in Kernel32.dll. Unfortunately, 7.36 has this terrible bug described here that renders Skype unusable. I do not know if it affects every user, but apparently enough of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also has another annoying bug, where it "forgets" my audio, video and profile picture settings every time I launch it, and forces me to configure them every time. But that's a small issue compared to being downright unusable for calls - the only thing
 Skype is still useful for, now that much better and less buggy IM services are abundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we are in an interesting situation where the last officially supported Skype for Vista (probably XP too, haven't tried) has a critical bug rendering it useless. This bug will never be fixed, because Skype's developers decided to stop supporting Vista,
 probably by purposely tweaking the build process to stop targeting it once it went out of support in April this year.</p>
<p>Right now the only solution for Vista is to install a slightly older version - 7.29 works according to SG_10, and I tried 7.31, which works just as well, with no issues so far. Versions 7.32-7.35 give

this annoying error</a> when I try to run them, so I skip them. Where to get it? The offline MSI installer are still on Skype's servers, even though they are purposely hidden:</p>
<p><a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.31.0.104.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.31.0.104.msi</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround will continue working until Microsoft once again decides to disable older versions and prevent them from connecting to the network. At that point, you will probably no longer be able to use Skype at all on Vista or older Windows OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Don't forget to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12096/how-do-i-turn-off-automatic-updates-in-skype-for-windows-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disable the Skype automatic updates</a>, or it might force the broken 7.36 down your throat again.</p>
<br />
<p>P.P.S. Don't be mad at the useless responses of the support folks here. The ones posting here are typically the lowest-grade "support" techs with no clue about anything except how to pick a standard automatic reply from a drop-down list. Sad, but that's
 how support works in every big corporation these days.</p>
