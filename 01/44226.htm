<p>In the Xbox One's network settings you'll find a button for advanced settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that each and every Xbox One has a DIFFERENT port for Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the first Xbox has Port 3074 (make sure you don't have a Xbox 360 that uses the same port). Then the other five consoles need to use a different port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each console has gotten a different port assigned, make sure that each console has a fixed, static IP set up in your router. The consoles MUST NOT change their IP addresses (unless you want to edit your port forwarding rules every time the IP changes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, with each Port number and IP address, set up port forwarding rules in your router to each specific console.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have a 2017 MacBook Pro running 10.12.5. &nbsp;Using Skype version 7.46.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built in Isight camera has suddenly stopped working ONLY for Skype - getting the message "Video is turned off". &nbsp;It has worked great until a week ago so very puzzled.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue today. I haven't used it in a while, so I updated today to see if that would fix the problem. It didn't.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The latest version of Skype for Mac is version 7.56. If you are using v.7.46 then please try updating to the latest version available for Mac users. Can you also check if your built0-in camera is recognized by the application?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the application and click <strong>Skype</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Choose <strong>Preferences </strong>and go to<strong> Audio/Video</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you can see your video feed then your webcam is working properly. If you cannot, please try to completely uninstall and then re-install the Skype application to reset your settings.&nbsp;You can

<p>I don't understand why people (even MS representative) still use this way to procrastinate fixes to issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know very well that the latest version of Skype does not solve the problem. In fact, I have&nbsp;7.56 (776) and theisight camera refises to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During a call, I see the camera icon, I click on it, the LED turns on and turns off after a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera works just fine with any other app (Google Hangout, Slack, Photo Booth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking to completely remove and reinstall Skype, or update it, is not a solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is on Skype and has to be fixed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask me for some logs, some profiling logs, whatever can help you find the root cause: that's what I can accept. I can't accept a "reinstall the app" as a professional answer unless you have no proper knowledge of how to provide a decent support.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 screen becomes unresponsive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelgreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 screen becomes unresponsive.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand new Surface Pro 3 just a week ago and I started having a problem within three days of purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I leave it on for a period of time and come back to it, the screen becomes unresponsive. The only fix I have found is to hold the power button down to reset it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is my Surface a lemon or is this a common problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.&nbsp; Sorry to hear you are having trouble with touchscreen on your Surface Pro 3 after a period of idle time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this also affect Pen, mouse, keyboard, or&nbsp;Type Cover input?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually ensure you have all available updates installed.&nbsp; Keep Surface plugged in throughout the process, and start with at least 3/4 battery:</p>
<p>Desktop&gt; Swipe for Charms&gt; Settings&gt; Control panel&gt; Windows update&gt; check for updates&gt; install</p>
<p>Restart Surface between layers of updates, and twice after the last update installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at Device manager when this is happening.&nbsp; Are there any banged out drivers?&nbsp; These may need an update, or uninstall (do not delete) followed by restart.&nbsp; You can also scan for hardware changes there, and see if this returns touch functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am still facing this. The screen becomes unresponsive and no longer responds to any kind of input.</p>
<p>After a while, it will shut itself off. I will know this has happened if the Surface has turned itself off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and installed all the updates possible but there has been no improvement. All the drivers seem fine when I check them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Shiho.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-This mainly happens when I leave Onenote on for a period of time (both the tile screen app and the windows app). It also happens with the app, Drawboard PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I use my surface on medium to max brightness and I have automatic sleep turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-This happens when I leave the device on high brightness and I haven't touched the screen during a period of time while Onenote is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>re: what I am seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, I am in class with Onenote open waiting to take notes. After a while, when I come back to take notes, the Surface Screen becomes unresponsive. None of the physical buttons work except for the hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Has anyone lost features on their Linx8 after Windows10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all, since I upgraded my Linx8 to windows 10 there are three major issues I have come across. First auto rotate feature has gone making some games impossible to play, second I can not seem to get any audio, and third camera won't open will just crash.
 All drivers are up to date and working properly, it seems&nbsp;more desktop set up than tablet friendly, any help on this issue will be very grateful.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to open Camera I get "Something went wrong" error code: 0xa00f4246(0x800705AA), as for Rotation the option isn't there at all in setting's as a TABLET it should be and was on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>As its not a sound card it is hard to get the drivers, as it has put the same ones on, the above information seems PC related more so than the TABLET Linx8, it's a shame as its runs so much better but must revert back to 8.1 soon if cant sort it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific way you can install/upgrade windows 10 as a TABLET os, as it just seems its set up more for PC ?</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to internet via using WI-FI</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Can't connect to my wifi</p>
<p>I uppdated my computer the second i woke up today. I bought this new lapptop 4days ago. When the update was done, i could not connect to any wifi spots. I use wireless connection. I can connect to my wifi with my phone, and another pc, but not with my own.
 Also when i try to restart the pc, it says ":( your pc ran into a problem, and needs to restart" and then it restarts after along time. After the update, the pc became way slower and just bad. Again, i bought this FOUR days ago. I have reset the pc, but that
 did not work. I would love to get some help with this. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Error video could not be decoded</h2>
                    <p>Since I've installed Windows 10 I've had a problem with videos playing within a web browser and the xbox application. They just don't play. Youtube (works fine) any other website doesn't. Also the Xbox Application I get "Error: Video could not be decoded".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reinstalled the OS from a fresh install, same thing happened. An update happened, it rebooted it worked. Then I got another update and rebooted, and same thing all over again. Videos won't play. What is going wrong? I've had nothing but trouble since
 I've upgraded to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I've already done this before I actually posted on here. I searched the internet and others are having the same problems, even since Windows 8.1. I have never used Windows 8.1 but I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 so I skipped Windows 8.1 completely.
 But I have browsed the internet and it's not just me that's having the problem with the same issues. It's a Windows fault or a Driver issue that Microsoft has given me, but seems more a common problem than just me, myself alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a screenshot I have taken for you which is located here:&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/n2HaTLs.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back if you can, cause this bug is annoying more than anything. I can only watch videos from Youtube and that's it. Any others it don't work just constant loading and the Xbox application just constantly says "Error Could not Decode Video" or
 something similar to that.</p>

            I'm getting this same "video can't be decoded error" but its &nbsp;when trying to use windows dvd player in 10. codec worked fine in 7 before the upgrade on this machine. Display adapter (and any other drivers that have updated for 10) have been installed and
 everything else seems to be working ok. I've tried to download&nbsp;other codec but still nothing. It just sucks, I mean how can you screw up something you had right for over a decade (dvd playback) I need to use this for a project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I too am having the same issue it is when I open the news from start menu.&nbsp; I can't resolve the issue either and I see that Microsoft doesn't appear to be coming up with a solution.&nbsp; Sucks.&nbsp; I have discovered the reason is cause Microsoft has removed the
 Window Media Player.&nbsp; I had it on my laptop but now it is gone.&nbsp; Still have it on my desktop and the videos work properly.&nbsp; Microsoft should put windows media back with windows 10.&nbsp; I am seriously thinking about reverting back to windows 7.&nbsp; Not too happy.

            It is because of windows 10 removing the windows media.&nbsp; I still have it on my desktop that has windows 10 and the media works fine.&nbsp; One needs to **** to Microsoft about the issue, if any of them are listening.<br />

 "programs and features" then "turn windows features on or off"&nbsp; once at that screen check mark and open "Windows Media" then be sure to check off " Windows Media Player"&nbsp; That should solve the problem.&nbsp;

            <p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem but it appears to be even broader. </p>
<p>
</p><p>=======================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DVD player/writer (HP DVD A DH16ACSH SATA) which came with my HP Pavillion Slimline (s5-1205z) that played back DVDs perfectly in Windows 7. With Windows 10 the Windows DVD Player app generates an error message that the "video could not be decoded".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go into Device Manager it identifies the device as a CVD-Rom player:</p>
<p>
</p><p>hp DVD A DH16ACSH SATA CdRom Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right-click on This PC and select Open, I see the DVD player listed as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVD RW Drive (E:)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also shows the title of the DVD. If I Open the DVD I can read folders on the DVD. If I go into the video folder, I see video files (e.g. VTS_01_1.VOB) with the Windows Live Movie Maker icon. If I click on the file, Movie Maker pops up and show distorted
 video (with just a few slices of video image).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, I am able to read and copy the DVD with a 3rd party DVD copier (1Click DVD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another video playback issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most (but not all) wmv and mp4 files will not play in either Windows Media Player or the Windows 10 Movies &amp; TV player.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a series of mp4 videos that all came from the same source ("How-to" golf videos, step 1, step 2, etc.). Step 1 video does play (sometimes) in Windows Media Player and sometimes in Movies &amp; TV Player. But Step 2 of the same mp3 video series
 gives me an error saying "this item is in a format we don't support - 0xc00d36b4 (0xc00d36b4)".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same videos play perfectly in QuickTime and iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another related video playback issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried loading mov video files with Movie &amp; TV Player and Windows Media Player. Any one of three things will occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. video does not play and shows an error message - 0xc00d5212 (0xc00d5212)</p>
<p>2. video does not play but audio will play</p>
<p>3. Video and audio player brilliantly&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. All videos play perfectly in QuickTime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another related video playback issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run the following video in YouTube (using Microsoft Edge):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Introducing Windows 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6vmNz-PhE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a message that shows up briefly saying that I need to download Adobe Flash Player (which I understand is built into Microsoft Edge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play the video using Google Chrome.</p>
<p><br />
======================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sum:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows DVD Player will not play DVD's but will play CD's. I have spoken with Microsoft Tech Support and have tried all available drivers (the driver installed is the latest driver). My DVD copier software recognizes the DVD Writer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Video playback issues persist with Movie &amp; TV Player, Windows Media Player and Microsoft Edge browser.&nbsp;I have spoken with Microsoft Tech Support with this issue as well and have tried all available drivers (the driver installed is the latest driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Specific problems with video playback include Movie &amp; TV Player and Windows Media Player having problems with mp4 and mov video that work fine with QuickTime player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Specific problems with video playback also include Microsoft Edge browser which fails to even run some Windows 10 YouTube videos that run fine with Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. DVD Player and Youtube video examples always fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Video playback with Movie &amp; TV Player and Windows Media Player (not to mention Windows Live Movie Maker) fail regularly, but the video files that fail are not always the same videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I always go to the manufacturers website and get the latest drivers for anything I install. Most of the time the drivers that come with things are out-of-date when you get them.</p>

    <title>Increasingly frequent Blue Screen error, potentially involving an MSI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nalydrelwof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increasingly frequent Blue Screen error, potentially involving an MSI Radeon HD 7850 PE</h2>
                    Hello everyone.&nbsp; I have a custom built computer that is not more than 1 1/2 months old at this point.&nbsp; I am having increasingly frequent BSODs, usually 0x01E (KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED) and 0x07F (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP).&nbsp; Both are caused either
 by the NT Kernel itself (ntoskrnl.exe), or caused by a graphics component (atikmdag.sys or dxgmms1.sys (a DirectX component)).&nbsp; I have all five dumps, and I can furnish them on request; however, since they are memory dumps I am reluctant to distribute them
 unless they are sorely needed to diagnose the issue.&nbsp; The BSODs span a roughly one month period, starting from 3 weeks after the computer was completely built and Windows was installed (first BSOD: 8/11/12), to September 9th 2012.&nbsp; For the past two weeks or
 so I have been spending hours on the phone with IT professionals who are good friends, and, due to time constraints, we haven't gotten very far into solving the issue.&nbsp; I will continue to work with them on the issue, as we still have not tried everything we
 have planned to try.&nbsp; However, I am opening it up to this forum as well, to see if I can get additional sources of help and ideas.<br />
<br />
Here are my specs:<br />
-Intel Core i5 3570K @ stock clock speeds<br />
-MSI Radeon 7850 Power Edition @ *860Mhz clock and 1200Mhz memory speeds* (this is after a de-overclock, removing the factory core overclock of 90Mhz)<br />
-16GB 4x4GB Corsair Vengeance RAM @ 1333Mhz with correct timings in BIOS<br />
-ASUS P8Z77-V LK Motherboard<br />
-500GB Hard Drive with Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit installed<br />
-250GB Hard Drive formatted as NTFS<br />
-750W Corsair HX-750 Modular PSU<br />
<br />
Key software you should know about:<br />
AMD Catalyst 64 bit v2012.0806.1213.19931 (from the About Screen)<br />
Anti-virus: Microsoft Security Essentials 64bit (note that I had the 32bit version of AVG for all of about 2 hours before I replaced it with MSE)<br />
Firewall: ZoneAlarm Personal Firewall<br />
Overclocking Utilities: MSI Afterburner (32bit), used briefly to save the default settings and set the card to AMD's reference speeds<br />
DirectX: Numerous versions have been downloaded by various games I have used on Steam; namely the versions required by the Source-based games, Deus Ex: HR, the World of Tanks Client, and Borderlands.<br />
<br />
What I have tried so far:<br />
-Updating the UEFI BIOS from the stock version to the very latest version<br />
-Updating AMD Graphics Drivers<br />
-Updating various chipset drivers (some didn't update, despite completing, I might add)<br />
<br />
What I plan to do for now:<br />
-Test the Graphics Card's RAM, however, I need a recommendation for what tool to use in that process<br />
-Remove and/or reorganize RAM sticks (this is not preferred, as I don't have a reliably static free/dust free environment (read: college dorm), and drier weather is approaching)<br />
-If the graphics card fails to produce a BSOD or some other measurable form of instability, and the RAM tests fail to produce greater stability, I will resort to reformatting the primary (500GB) hard drive, and re-install Windows 7 (or install Windows 8 if
 it takes that long to get this system to the point of needing a new OS install, and there are significant benefits to installing the latest version).<br />
<br />
What I need to know:<br />
-What tools should I use to test the Graphics Card's RAM.&nbsp; I have heard that FurMark might be able to produce errors should I have a faulty Graphics Card, and in theory should allow me to purposely force a BSOD to confirm the graphics card's failure.&nbsp; I have
 also seen a Memtest-like Graphics Card RAM tester, but it looked rather old; are there any current Graphics RAM testers that could be recommended?<br />
-What, if anything, can I do to test RAM WITHOUT resorting to swapping sticks?&nbsp; I ask this, not out of laziness, but rather because of the aforementioned concerns of static and dust in my dorm room; while I don't live in the driest area of the US, Fall is upon
 us, and it still tends to get very dry around here.<br />
-What else do I need to be concerned about potentially failing in this machine?&nbsp; I know that the hard drive is another potential concern, how would I go about testing that?&nbsp; However, in all the posts that I see of BSODs being caused by RAM and/or hard drive
 failures, the crashes are even more frequent than what I experience, and usually generate more varied issues.&nbsp; What else could possibly be causing this?<br />
<br />
Like I said, I can make the minidumps available upon request; I just want to have some control over who gets what basically amounts to dumps of whatever was in my RAM at the time.&nbsp; I am open to any help you may provide me, and thank you in advance for the help!<br />

            We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

http://sysnative.com/0x8/BSOD_Windows7_Vista_v2.64_jcgriff2_.exe<br />
<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the contents of that folder<br />
Please upload them to skydrive or a file sharing service and put a link to them in your next post.<br />
<br />
Please also go to start&gt;search/run&gt;cmd&gt;msinfo32 and include it in the upload<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />

            Okay.&nbsp; The dumps and system information are posted on Ubuntu One (this is the first time I have used UO for public files, so I hope this works).<br />
<br />
Here are the Dumps:<br />
http://ubuntuone.com/30JmhptcGD14Xj1Oj3fOr3<br />
<br />
Here is the system info output:<br />
http://ubuntuone.com/0INwr2tky1nrOM4R1A61v3<br />
<br />
Hopefully between that data, and my previous and current plans, you should have all the necessary information to help me with my issues.&nbsp; Thank you for your quick reply, and I look forward to what advice you may have for me.<br />
<br />
Also, I do NOT have any overclocks enabled right now.&nbsp; The only reason I had MSI Afterburner was to remove the factory overclock on my graphics card (as it was a model that came overclocked).&nbsp; All components are running at reference/stock speeds.<br />

            Both links work for me.&nbsp; The links should not navigate anywhere, rather, they are direct download links to the information requested.&nbsp; If you aren't already, please try Firefox 15.0.1; I doubt you should be having issues.&nbsp; The Ubuntu One service is cross-platform,
 and therefore should work under Windows, Linux, and Mac.&nbsp; An update into where I am with the system: on Saturday 9/15/12 I disabled the MSI Radeon card in UEFI BIOS and switched over to the Intel GMA 4000 Integrated Graphics provided by my Ivy Bridge Core
 i5 Processor.&nbsp; I used the machine for 8 hours with no sign of any issues, longer than the 1-4 hours that it would take to cause a Blue Screen Error if it were running with the discrete card.&nbsp; Therefore, I have determined to the best of my abilities that the
 graphics card was at fault, not the motherboard.&nbsp; The machine is no longer in my custody, and is being serviced by someone under the employ of one of the family friends that has been helping me for the past two weeks.&nbsp; However, any further insights are welcome
 and I will pass them along to the technician who is now servicing my computer.<br />

<p>You still need a Xbox Live Gold account to play online, EA games or not.&nbsp; EA online pass codes are included in new EA games to allow you purchase extra online content, it doesn't allow you play online on Live without a Gold account.

<p>I was very reluctant to follow through on the clean install as apparently this would result in the loss of my apps and programs if not all of my files (I have backups for most of these). These are very important to me. So I managed to restore the system
 using a feature in Windows 10 to what it was only about a week before it crashed. Windows had stored a restore point on January 20, 2018. Very grateful for this feature. After a few updates, the computer seems to be working with only a couple of bugs. What
 preceded the incident was a freeze while in Facebook. The computer has frozen before, and the only solution has been to manually shut it off. Always before it would return to normal after being turned back on. Not this time, though. It just went to automatic
 repair automatically over and over again.<br />
</p>
<p>But, I am very grateful for the restore option in Windows 10. Saved a lot of work and a lot of money in programs and apps!</p>

            We are pleased to know that you were able to manage the issue through a Windows 10 restore point. The workaround that you have suggested may be helpful to other forum members that are having the same issue.
<br />
<br />
As a recommendation, you may also try a different browser while accessing Facebook and see if the issue still occurs.<br />

<h2>            May as well join the trolls for this one</h2>
                    
<p>Just wish i could understand how people play this, and believe it to be a "Decent" game, don't get me wrong, Zombies and campaign are great, no complaints there, It's the xbox live matches that bug me, I've held me tongue now for as long as i can about this,
 The amount of hackers i have come across is unbelievable, Now I've been playing on PC for a few years and i have run into hackers there too, but no where near as many as on xbox, And i don't understand why nothing is being done about it, On Steam for example
 theirs VAC bans in place and it seems to work fine, Having played CSS and TF2 for the best part of my gaming i like to think i can tell when someone is just genuinely good, And when someone is just running down the center of the map popping head-shots....and
 not just 1 or 2, I mean literally running down the center and slaughtering everyone, Some matches i have been in, Even on my team so it's not like i am just having a go for losing, They get kill streaks of 40+ before dying, So my question is this, How do you
 lot enjoy this game? Or should i just follow everyone else and crack it wide open? rant over and i am aware of the comments i will get about trolling etc, but remember, It's only on live i have the problem, not with the game but the community and the lack
 of admins to oversee these events. Also thanks for anyone who took the time to read this through before commenting.</p>

<p>Just some of the actions seem very very strange, Like i've had parties with my friends where someone has joined late and got the other team, then when theirs no spy planes or anything they get sniper kills through walls at the opposite end of the map, but
 i do find some of the kill streaks, Regardless of how good someone is to be a bit far fetched, It's as though their perfect, Admittadly i am terrible haha i can break even most of the time for KDR and on occasions i have done quite well, But we all make mistakes,
 Or so i assumed, I find it frustrating when i see someone just running down the center stretch of...i think it's havana, The long road in the middle, busses and cars on it and buildings at each side, And just popping heads like it's going out of fashion, But
 it could just be me seeing things because no one else can see it haha, Anyway thanks for the reply man</p>

<p>I've racked up around 13 days of play time and never seen anyone get a killstreak of anywhere near 40. My best is 29 on jungle and I really worked for that, although I was much higher rank compared to most on the other team. I have seen a video of a friends
 game where he was playing TDM on nuketown and he worked his way up to unlock the chopper gunner and he just mowed down towns of spawning nubs and got a 52 killstreak but that was legit.</p>

<p>Modded controllers. There are supposedly some that ms sort of support. I guess its a gray area. But even with a rapidfire controller there is still a rate cap thats keeps them from firing real fast.

            <p>Hi John, </p>
<p><br />
Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Are you referring to this Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fixit</a>? </p>
<p>2. Is this computer on a domain network? </p>
<p>3. Are you able to login to Desktop? Have you try to boot the computer to safe mode?
</p>
<p>4. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest unplug all the external devices to the computer except mouse and keyboard to see if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reply with more information so that we could help you further. </p>
        </p>

<h2>            Drive not able to be added to Storage Spaces</h2>
                    <div>I am having difficulties trying to create a storage space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have four Hard Drives in my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Samsung 128Gb SSD x2</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Caviar Green 2TB</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Older 320 Gb drive</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to *merge* the two last ones. The problem is, that the 2TB drive does not show up in the configuration screen.:</div>
<div>http://bramvanroy.be/files/images/storagespaces.jpg</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I formatted both hard drives so that can't be it. Any help is appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does it have to do with the fact that the system reserved some space on this drive? If so, how can I bypass/undo this?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi, Bram,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding Disk Partitions</p>
<p>Each disk can have up to four standard partitions. Typically, these standard partitions are designated as
<em>primary partitions</em>. You can use primary partitions to store files.<br />
To use more than&nbsp;four partitions, designate&nbsp;one of the four partitions as an extended partition.</p>
<p>Software tools to extend the visible partition space beyond 2 TB are not supported on BIOS because they can interfere with application compatibility and recovery software solutions.<br />

            So, you mean more than 2TB is impossible to achieve in Storage Spaces.

<p>My previous post contained a link with the following statement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software tools to extend the visible partition space beyond 2 TB are not supported on BIOS because they can interfere with application compatibility and recovery software solutions.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basic system partition requirements are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Must have at least 100 megabytes (MB) of hard drive space.<br />
</li><li>Must have enough free space to create shadow copies of the partition.<br />
<p>If the partition is less than 500 MB, it must have at least 50 MB of free space.<br />
<br />
If the partition is 500 MB or larger, it must have at least 320 MB of free space.<br />
<br />
If the partition is larger than 1 gigabyte (GB), we recommend that it should have at least 1 GB free.<br />
</p>

    <title>Free Space in Disk Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> girishmanjunath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free Space in Disk Management</h2>
                    <p>I messed up somehow in partitioning my drive ages ago, and now, I have 53 gigs free on one side of a drive in use, and 206 on the other. Now, I can't convert that 53gigs into a partition to begin moving and merging, so I'd like some help in this regard.
 How can I change the partition such that all the free space is consolidated?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To increase the size of C you first need to reduce the size of D. This enables you to increase the size of C by taking up the space D has vacated. When you resize partitions it is all about before
 and after. Thus in the simple operation of D giving up space to C when resizing or reducing the size of D the free space needs to be created before D. This enables you to resize C by expanding into the free space you now have after C. When you have done the
 above apply the changes. </span></p>
