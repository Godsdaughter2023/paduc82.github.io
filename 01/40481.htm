<h2>            Administrator does not have right to change access permission of program files.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>the issue basically started from certain apps not opening in windows 10, browsing through the internet gave some hints on user control etc. myself being an administrator was surprised to notice that access to windows app folder in program file was denied.
 tried to change the owner and then tweak the permission, but individual app started poping up errors and could not complete the change the in ownership or change in access control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is frustrating to note that users are facing similar problem of app not opening, but Microsoft is doing nothing. to add to our misery, the technical support is available only from 9-6 that too from Monday to Friday, so working people should leave their
 work and attend Microsoft executives during their office hours</p>
<p>
</p><p>request an urgent help on the matter.</p>

<p>THANKS, JANNINE FOR YOUR RESPONSE</p>
<p>VERSION IS CURRENT</p>
<p>IT WAS GOOD AND LOGICAL AND SHOULD HAVE WORKED&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;TRIED YOUR SOLUTION-NUMEROUS TIMES WITHOUT SUCESS . INCLUDING RESTART BEFORE REINSTALL</p>
<p>&nbsp;THINK I FINALLY FOUND THE CULPRIT--ONE CONTACT HAD AN OLD AND A NEW&nbsp; EMAIL/ SIGNIN ADDRESS--BOTH OF WHICH WERE REASONABLY SIMILAR AND APPARENTLY SKYPE COULD NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE 2 AND THUS PARTIALLY HUNG ITSELF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;AFTER I DELETED ONE CONTACT AND THE MESSAGES - EVERYTHING CAME BACK TO NORMAL -fingers are still crossed-ha!</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay, I lost this thread for a couple of days. This is Conexant audio, so I'd hope the built-in audio driver would work. Can you give it a try and let me know? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has released a security advisory (KB3033929) for IT professionals about SHA-2 code signing support. The security advisory announces the availability of a security update and contains additional security-related information.</p>
<p>
Some users cannot install this&nbsp;security update if their computers meet the following conditions:
</p><ul>
<li>Have a multiple-boot configuration of Windows and various distributions of Linux</li><li>Use a non-Windows boot loader</li><li>Have&nbsp;Windows and Linux installed on separate drives</li></ul>
We have been able to verify that systems that have the Windows boot loader enabled as the primary loader are successfully able to install this update and that systems that have a non-Windows boot loader specified as the primary boot loader cannot&nbsp;install the
 update, even if the user uses that loader to select Windows.
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the articles mentioned below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Power supply adaptor&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just got my Xbox One from US.</p>
<p>unfortunately made a big mistake, did not check the power rating - was too excited&nbsp;and connect the power cable for US ( 110V )&nbsp;to Qatar power grid (220 V ),</p>
<p>As a result&nbsp; power&nbsp; adaptor is gone completely, Good news that I did not connected the console itself))</p>
<p>I can not buy&nbsp;officially Xbox One in Qatar yet, so no tech support here.</p>
<p>Now I am trying to be more careful((</p>
<p>Here is the&nbsp;questions?</p>
<p>1, Is Xbox 360 power cable is suitable with Xbox One?</p>
<p>2. If not can I fit the Xbox power cable from UK or Europe to my console?</p>
<p>3. where I can buy power cable in UK and what is the price?</p>
<p>regards,</p>

Sorry for hijacking this question, but since the OP hasn't replied in 4 days and I'm having a highly similar problem, I thought I should post here.
<div><br />
<div>Similarities:</div>
<div>- I am also running 64-bit Windows 7, but on Home Premium</div>
<div>- I am also trying to install a Huawei broadband wireless dongle that is recognized as a "Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device", though of a different model (E3231).&nbsp;</div>
<div>- The driver also will not install, even though it works perfectly fine on another W7 Basic netbook</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additional Information:</div>
<div>- I am getting a Code 31 error in device manager, and have failed to find or install any relevant drivers from the manufacturer/windows update</div>
<div>- I have tried all the USB ports available, USB2.0/3.0 including connecting a USB hub</div>
<div>- I have tried uninstalling the driver + firmware manually and restarting</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any idea whereabouts I should start looking for a solution?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            Alright, I fixed this after a few hours of battling with it!&nbsp;<br />
First make sure that sharing is turned OFF for both connections.<br />
After making sure they are not shared, CTRL+Click on both of them so that they are both highlighted in the Network Connections window. Then right+click and bridge the connections and it should work!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Cheers!

            Thank you Edgar.<br />
I'm using Windows10. After I installed a Window 10 Feature update 1907, my USB mobile broadband modem stopped working.<br />
After much troubleshooting of the network adapters &amp; IP config changes etc and calls to Microsoft and Vodafone Support to no avail, I found this post.<br />
Figured if it works on Win7 it should work on Win10.<br />
<br />
So your solution of bridging the network connection adapters resolved the NDIS connection issue for my USB mobile broadband modem.&nbsp;<br />
(Vodaphone (Australia) 4G Pocket WiFi R216h modem).<br />
<br />
However, the ethernet connection then stopped working. That will mostly not affect me as I normally only use the USB modem.<br />
Occasionally when I take my PC to a family member's house to use an Ethernet connection will I need to unbridge the ethernet adaptor connection.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft support had no solution for me.<br />

            Hi! I had the same error pop up and I managed to fix it. It seems that you'll need to click on the "..." button in the top right hand corner of the camera screen then click settings and change the "press and hold camera button" to "burst shot". I don't
 know why that fixed it but it did. Of course, if you try to use the rear camera the same error will pop up so you'll need to disable the "press and hold camera button" to use the rear camera again.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Live Mail 2012 synchronization with Outlook.com&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yaqub k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2012 synchronization with Outlook.com&#58;  Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Effective late June 2016, Windows Live Mail 2012 will no longer synchronize emails, contacts, and calendar events from email accounts ending in @outlook.com,
 @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com. These email accounts are powered by Outlook.com.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Outlook.com is being upgraded</span><span> to a new infrastructure that delivers innovative email and calendar
 experiences with enhanced performance, security, and reliability. The Windows Live 2012 email application does not support the modern synchronization technologies used by the new Outlook.com, so once your account is upgraded to the new Outlook.com, you will
 no longer be able to send or receive Outlook.com email from Windows Live Mail 2012.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Rest assured, you can always access your Outlook.com account via any web browser at any time.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You will also continue to access your <span>emails, contacts, and calendar
</span>data that is currently stored in Windows Live Mail 2012.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can find additional details and options for accessing your Outlook.com account once Windows Live Mail 2012 stops connecting to the email service
 at </span></span><a href="https://support.office.com/article/45453b92-373b-4bbb-88ca-f8ec74f8e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Live Mail 2012 will not connect to Outlook.com:<span>&nbsp;
</span>help and next steps. </span></span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Here are answers to some common questions involving the end of service for Windows Live Mail 2012:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Why is Microsoft making this change?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>We are
</span></span><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/02/17/outlook-com-out-of-preview-and-better-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">upgrading Outlook.com</span></span></a><span><span>to
 a new infrastructure, powered by Office 365, that helps you collaborate effortlessly with Office documents, get more done using partner add-ins, and focus on what matters.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This new infrastructure uses modern synchronization protocols that provide enhanced performance, security and reliability. Windows Live Mail 2012 uses an older synchronization protocol that is not compatible with this new infrastructure.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Who is affected by this change?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>This change affects all people who currently use Windows Live Mail to connect to their Outlook.com account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>People who use Windows Live Mail with other email services (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or others) are not affected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Outlook.com users who do not use Windows Live Mail are also not affected.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>What do I need to do?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Customers can continue to access their email via a web browser at
</span></span><a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">www.outlook.com</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If customers would like to move to another mail app from Microsoft, they can consider the following:

</li></ul>

<p><span><span>You can also use the full-featured Outlook desktop app to connect to your Outlook.com account, by taking advantage of a one-year free trial of O365
 Personal.<span>&nbsp; </span>This offer is limited to the Outlook.com customers affected by this change.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Customers who actively used Windows Live Mail during the timeframe January through March 2016 received an email notification of the change and an offer for Office 365 Personal, if needed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Customers should refer to the email in your Outlook.com inbox for a link to redeem this promotion.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>When should I switch to the Mail app in Windows? Do I need to wait until my Outlook.com account is upgraded?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>We recommend you switch now. The Mail app on Windows works against both the old and new Outlook.com infrastructure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Switching now will help you avoid interruption when your account is upgraded. Upgrades for Windows Live Mail users are set to begin late June 2016.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>What happens to my email if I don’t switch from Windows Live Mail before my account is upgraded?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>You can continue accessing your email in a web browser by accessing
</span></span><a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">www.outlook.com</span></span></a><span><span>– but
 Windows Live Mail will no longer be able to connect.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Some customers may have locally stored data in Storage folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We recommend that customers move their locally stored data to their Outlook.com account prior to the upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
</span>See the </span></span><a href="https://support.office.com/article/45453b92-373b-4bbb-88ca-f8ec74f8e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Live Mail 2012 will not connect to Outlook.com:<span>&nbsp;
</span>help and next steps </span></span></a><span><span>for steps to move data, if needed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>How long do I have before I must stop using Windows Live Mail?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Windows Live Mail will stop connecting to Outlook.com beginning late June 2016. We recommend migrating to the Mail app on Windows 10 before that, though
 you can move any time you want to.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, you can continue to access your email in a web browser at
</span></span><a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">www.outlook.com</span></span></a><span><span>at
 any time. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can continue to use Windows Live Mail to connect to other email services via IMAP or POP3.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>I am having trouble migrating to the Mail app for Windows. Can someone in Microsoft help me?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>If you need technical assistance, search for answers or post a new thread describing your issue in this forum,
</span></span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=242006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Essentials community forum</span></span></a><span><span>.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>If I am using Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013, or Outlook 2016 to connect to my Outlook.com account, do I need to take any action when my account
 is upgraded? </span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>No, these versions of Outlook retain their connection to Outlook.com during the upgrade and no user action is required.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Which Outlook.com email addresses are affected?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>All email accounts on the Outlook.com service, including @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com and @msn.com email accounts, are affected.<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>What are my alternatives if I cannot upgrade from Windows 7 or cannot use the Mail app on Windows for another reason?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>You can always continue to access Outlook.com from any web browser. Alternatively, you may consider using the power of professional productivity that
 Outlook 2016 brings, which works on Windows 7, 8/8.1, 10.<span>&nbsp; </span>An Office 365 subscription includes the full feature Outlook 2016 desktop app as well as other productivity applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Can I get my Outlook.com account upgraded right away?</span></strong><span>
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We’re rolling out these upgrades to Outlook.com users as quickly as possible, with millions of users being upgraded each week. All Outlook.com users
 will get the upgrade, and there is no action you need to take in order to trigger the upgrade.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>If I stop using the Windows Live Mail app now, will my Outlook.com account be upgraded earlier than June 2016?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>If you received an email concerning your use of Windows Live Mail; then your account will not be upgraded prior to late June 2016.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Will I need to change my email address when my account is upgraded?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>No, you will keep your existing email address.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Will I need to change or update any settings on my phone to keep receiving email?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Your phone will remain connected to your Outlook.com account after the upgrade; there is no need to make any changes to keep receiving mail.</span></span></p>

</p><p>There evidently was an old beta version of Windows 10 on this laptop which has expired. &nbsp;The laptop had a legal version of windows Starter when it was new...I'd be happy to be able to revert to that but I can't get control of the computer no matter what
 I do, it goes back to that page</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is on an Acer Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for anyone who can help</p>
<p />

<p>Media Creation Tool will make you an iso and put it on a 8gb to 32gb thumbdrive
</p>
<p>Then you can install win10 fresh and if it doesn't automatically active once online you can plug in your win7 starter key.&nbsp; Which I hope you have written down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That iso will have a repair environment too.. you might be able to simply run its startup repair.</p>

            <p>I may not be as smart as I said I was because now I'm confused. &nbsp;I downloaded the Tool thingy which of course downloaded to MY working computer. &nbsp;I transfered that file to my Pin Drive. &nbsp;Then I clicked on UPDATE and of course it's sending the Windows 10
 to this computer...the one that doesn't have a problem. &nbsp;What goes on the Pin Drive? &nbsp;I'm assuming at this point that when the windows 10 download file is done, I'm suppose to then transfer that to the Pin drive also?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if that isn't right I need instructions. Also every time I try and plug the pin drive into the laptop the laptop freezes up and won't allow me to change the boot menu etc until I take the pin drive out, then it gives me 4 options NONE of which is my
 Pin Drive....GRRRRRRR....This damn laptop will not let me get past that page. &nbsp;No matter what I do. &nbsp;I push f2 and tell it to change the boot order but it just reverts back to the HDD first as soon as I turn it on again. &nbsp;If I put the pin drive in with anything
 on it, like the tool that downloaded to it , it locks up the screen and won't let me see the choices to boot from a different device until I take it out, then it shows me the choices and when I try and tell it to use the USB it doesn't it just goes back to
 the page I can't get past!</p>

            <p>The Media Creation Tool, when you run it it should have offered to make a usb installion for use on another computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which will download the iso and put it onto &amp;&nbsp;make the usb thumbdrive a bootable drive and then you should be able to press your F2 and
 choose the usb drive to boot up from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to make that bootable&nbsp;usb drive while using another computer.&nbsp; Don't put the media creation tool on the usb.</p>

            <p>ok here is some more information and maybe I'm making progress. &nbsp;I changed the USB port and got a screen to come up that gave me the option to boot from my USB. &nbsp;Now I have both the windows 10 download .exe on that pin drive and also the Tool whatever that
 is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but instead of booting from that pin drive it took me to a &nbsp;black and white page where it just says &nbsp;C:\&gt; &nbsp;with the cursor blinking....I'm in the DOS menu I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I suppose to do something with the two files I have on the pin drive that I haven't done. &nbsp;Am I suppose to use that tool somehow to make the .exe file into something else that can be booted or what??? &nbsp;How do I get this ISO that is talked about &nbsp; How
 do I use the tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to use that tool and it asked me if it was ok for this app to make changes to my computer and I hesitated and then said ok but then stopped it as it was clear it was going to try and install windows 10 on THIS computer not the computer with the
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a command I can type in to the laptop that will make it open up my nano pin drive so I can click on the tool there and let it start the installation on the laptop ....I'm still confused what the ISO is all about I thought that was a file I had to
 mount with my pretend magic drive or something....I only have two files on that pin drive the Get Windows .exe downloaded file and the creation tool file&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions please and again thank you for the help</p>

            <p>My question was answered and the instruction I got to download the ISO and load it that way solved my problem as I was able to boot from that pin drive and with the old windows 7 starter number from the bottom tag on the computer Microsoft activated it for
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for fun I'll Tell you what happened next. &nbsp;The computer is all updated with a working windows 10 OS activated but the keyboard has a problem and the keyboard needed to be replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned the keyboard to the lady who owned it and told her the keyboard needed to be replaced and so she took it to the mall and the Tech at Octagon computers in SM Angeles City, Philippines told the lady that the windows 10 would expire and he returned
 it to the Windows 7 starter, then told her she needed to buy Virus...AVG was already on the Windows 10, then sold her a few other things and by reverting it back to windows 7 the woman lost all the legal programs I put on the laptop for her amounting to Hundreds
 of dollars worth of software. &nbsp;Things like Microsoft office Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Punch Home Suit, Media Monkey, and on and on and on all lost because he lied and told the woman who knows nothing about computers that the OS that Microsoft had Activated was
 going to expire again....GRRRRRRR I hate lying technicians who don't know *it and just want to take advantage of stupid non computer people and sell them more **** they don't need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lady has returned the laptop to me and asked me to rebuild it all again for her. &nbsp;At least the Tech did change our her laptop keyboard but get this....the sound can barely be heard on the laptop, and the tech just told the lady that was Normal...he was
 so full of *it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound clearly has a short in it and evidently he could not fix it probably without replacing the motherboard...so he lies to her and tells her it's just normal that all laptops are like that....</p>

<h2>            Corrupted .cab files</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Im having problems with my windows for a while now.. everything started with some nasty thing i got on my PC called TubeDimmer, anyway i maniged to remove that, but ever since i got it when i try watching videos on the internet they get blurry and really
 pixely at some point and if i try to play a .GIF it just stops at some point... when i watch something on netflix i got same + after i watch a while i got a message saying there are issues with my Microsoft silverlight (im using windows 8 btw)... I got really
 annoyed of all that and i thought windows refresh would help... it didnt... i tried the windows recovery - didnt help aswell.... what happened is after i did the recovery i lost all my programs and i cant install them now.</div>
<div>after i try to install Microsoft Silverlight i get - file is corrupted.. i tried running the silverlight troubleshoot it didnt help</div>
<div>when i try to install Java i get - data1.cab corrupted</div>
<div>when i try to install Skype i get - Product.cab corrupted</div>
<div>Some programs i maniged to install, but with most im having huge struggles and i really dont know what to do now</div>
<div>I think that TubeDImmer thing made some damage to my Windows for which i cant find a solution... and now its not just the crappy videos i need to deal with, but also the messed up installer. If anyone knows anything that can be a good solution PLEASE HELP</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

            OK i expected that reinstalling everything with a disc is going to be the only left solution for me, so i will probably go and buy a new windows 8, but since i kinda suck with anything that requires computer skills can you please tell me:

<div>1. After i buy a new Windows 8 - is the installation process hard, and is there a chance where i can mess up big time and actually keep my damaged version of windows, or all i need to do is put the cd and let it do its work</div>
<div>2. Do i need to make to do something to make sure i get rid of all the corrupted stuff on my current Windows, or again the new Windows will do everything by itself</div>
<div>3. There shouldn't be a problem to replace windows 8 with a different windwos 8 right ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Probably these are stupid questions, but i just wanted to be sure about these stuff before i buy new Windows 8 DVD</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you !</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go through the link to have a clear idea about Svchost.exe.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-is-svchost-exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-is-svchost-exe</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the error details, it appears that one of the application which uses the Svchost.exe process is causing the crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few things you may try and get this sorted out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Run a System File Checker scan to make sure the system files on the computer are not corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Type command prompt in the start screen. Right click on command prompt and then select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Type sfc /scannow and press enter.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Wait till the scan completes. If you receive any errors, then go to C:\Windows\logs\CBS</p>
<p>Copy and paste the CBS file to the desktop and go through it for any errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Also, place the computer in clean boot state just to find out which application is causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Once done troubleshooting, place the computer back to normal state by following "How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If you have any concerns, let us know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I do appreciate you replying back and asking about a possible enforcement action on your account or console. As I stated before and as an Ambassador has stated before, we would not be able to properly explain what
 would happen to either you or your friends account or console. One of the reasons we went ahead and locked the previous posts was because the question had been answered by myself and the Ambassador. At this point, as stated previously, you will need to head
 to the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement Website</a>&nbsp;and possibly consider removing your friends profile from your Xbox so that your console is not affected by his actions. Another reason we locked the second
 thread, as I mentioned before, was because it broke section 13 of the Xbox Forums Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, we will be locking this thread as well. If you need further assistance with any other questions feel free to create a new thread but, do not spam the same question over and over again when it has been answered. Thank you for posting on
 Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>To use over 4GB of RAM you need 64 bit Windows.
</span><span>If you have 64 bit Windows you need to turn on memory remapping in the BIOS. Also make sure your motherboard supports the amount of RAM you have installed, and that the
 RAM is properly connected to the motherboard.</span><span><br />

<span>BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push it within the first 5 seconds:
 F1 &nbsp;F2 &nbsp;F10 &nbsp;F12 ESC &nbsp;DEL</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with memory remapping, it's different on each computer.</span></p>

<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Enable the memory remapping feature</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Check the BIOS settings to see whether the memory remapping feature is enabled. Memory remapping gives Windows access to more memory. You can enable the memory remapping feature in the BIOS by booting
 to the system setup. See the User's Guide for your computer for instructions on how to boot to system setup on your computer. The name for the memory remapping feature may be different for different hardware vendors. This can be listed as memory remapping,
 memory extension, or something similar. Be aware that your computer may not support the memory remapping feature.</span></p>

 send/receive in Windows Live Mail - you should get a <em>No new messages</em> status message.</p>

                    <p>Ok, so I randomly without thinking, turned my windows 8.1 laptop's brightness all the way down and now cannot see the screen. I want to fix this problem. I have tried to remove the battery and put it back in. I don't know any other ways to do it and I do
 not want to screw my laptop too much being a teenager and knowing barely anything. I also do not want to (but will as a last resort) send it to a technician. Please help send answers quickly.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help with the article but I found information that said that I could use a flashlight to see a very faint screen. After a few hours of looking for the cursor, I fixed it back to normal.</p>

<h2>            Borderlands 2 dlc not working on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I have several dlcs for Borderlands 2 on the 360 from the game of the year edition, however, when I play on the Xbox One I only have access to 3 of them. I've tried downloading directly off of the disc on the one since it does not show up in the manage game section but it still doesn't show up in the game. I have tried clearing my cache, redownloading and several hard resets and nothing seems to work.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Here is some information on each error code:</p>
<p>- WindowsUpdate_80070005: This is an 'Access Denied' arror, usually with the Windows Registry.</p>
<p>- WindowsUpdate_dt0000005: This is apparently a very uncommon, if not noexistant error message. Are you sure it wasn't 'WindowsUpdate_c0000005'?</p>
<p>- WindowsUpdate_dt000:&nbsp; A general Windows Update error.</p>
<p>Possible Solution: Try running your Windows Update application with elevated priviledges:</p>
<p>1. Click the Start button (bottom-left).</p>
<p>2. Type in 'update'. Right-click the link 'Windows Update', and select 'Run as Aministrator'.</p>
<p>3. Click 'OK' or 'Allow' for any security messages.</p>
<p>4. Click 'Check for updates' on the left panel. Try finding and installing updates now. If the problem continues, please telll us.</p>

<h2>            Dell Wireless 1505 in Latitude D830 and Windows 8 - Wirless conectivity not stable</h2>
                    <p>My take is Windows 8 PRO does not work with Dell Wireless 1505 Draft 820.11n WLAN Mini-Cars in Latitude D830s even with the Mar 2012 driver.</p>
<p>Spent 2 to 3 hours with MS Windows 8 Tech Support - 1187326097.</p>
<p>Config:</p>
<p>Dell Latitude D830 (Service tag 41QGLH1)&nbsp;with Dell Wireless 1505 Mini Card and 5.100.245.20, 13 Mar 2012 Driver and 4GB memory&nbsp;.&nbsp; Tested with Verison MiFi 4G LTE and company Wirless Outernet for external users</p>
<p>Windows 7 - wireless works great.</p>
<p>Windows 8 upgade installed &nbsp;- </p>
<p>KB2768703 installed</p>
<p>KB2758994 installed</p>
<p>KB2267602 installed</p>
<p>KB2756872 installed</p>
<p>KB2712101 installed</p>
<p>Wirless connects but does not remain on or stable.&nbsp; Keeps dropping down to limited connectivity or no connectivity.&nbsp; Will stay on for a bit.</p>
<p>Parallel&nbsp; Dell D830, with same model wirless card running Windows 7, continues to run wireless connection fine at the same time on the same networks.</p>
<p>So we will not upgrade the other 22 D830's to WINDOWS 8 PRO at this time.</p>
<p>Anyoen else have any experience or recommendations?</p>

            The Dell 1505 WLan card driver supplied with Win8 doesn't work.&nbsp; <br />
I had the same issue and installed the win7 driver instead which fixes the issue.<br />
Hundreds of posts out there but Dell isn't fixing it.<br />
I have now migrated to Win8.1 and the issue is back again.<br />

    <title>Long Read, This has been Bugging me for awhile though - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Long Read, This has been Bugging me for awhile though</h2>
                    
<p>I'll tell you one thing i've never been one to exploit a games economy system, and i played more than my fair share of games, fallout3, New vegas, red dead, gta 3,vice city, san andreas, and IV, and countless more, but my point is i've never had to cheat
 or use an exploit to gain the money needed to get things in a game. I'll admit i was about a month late into gta&nbsp; online so im a little behind on the money making, but from all i've heard with online missions getting payout reduced, and now im seeing with
 my own eyes the payout for races being nerfed. I just don't understand what there motives are in doing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything and i mean EVERYTHING&nbsp; in this game is overpriced, for the supercars the cheapest engine upgrade is more than 30,000 and theres Masks and clothing options that cost well over 10k. Guns that cost 8-10k with the attachments costing about the same,
 even sticky bombs which only cost 300 in SP now cost i think 600 in MP.Point is with all this stuff costing this much money and very few ways in game to earn it besides missions and races (both have had payouts nerfed significantly) what else is there for
 us to do, sell cars (you can only sell one every 45 minutes), rob stores? Mug people? I'm really leaning towards just exploiting this game right now and getting some free money becuase there is no way im spending Real$ for Fake$</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What im really getting at is that these so called "micro transactions" are getting out of hand and if us as gamers don't stand up against it its just going to keep getting worse. We need to boycott these micro transactions and NOT BUY THEM, i mean its bad
 enough we're all buying games now for $65 (tax included) and then spending at minimum another $40 for DLC we're into over $100 per game we wanna play, if we wanna "experience it all"&nbsp; and now with these micros, we're up in the $140 range if you get it all
 or even more for some games</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What most people don't understand or just don't care to think about is that when you ""purchase" DLC for a game, you're not adding content to your disc, you're merely "unlocking" it by paying them $20 to let your xbox decipher the code so you can play it,
 the content has always been on the disc, since they shipped it to the stores actually, so how are these companies getting away with charging us for a game twice? its not right, i can remember as a kid saving up money mowing yard after yard to buy a PS2 game
 for 50 bucks and when i bought that game that was it. There was no wait 2-3 months and pay $20 more to unlock the rest of the game its was just there from the start, I can't tell you how mad i would've been if i had to pay for a game twice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All it amounts to is some hollywood big shot had the idea to lock content away at launch and make you pay more for it later down the line and people bought into it and now its a behemoth, and looks to be going nowhere but up and we the gamers are paying
 for it, almost double. Sorry for the long read i just had to get that off my chest ( sadly i still don't feel better cuz we're all still going to have to pay what we're paying regardless of what i think, im just one guy who cares about my opinion besides me
 right?)</p>

<p>^ What he said.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On micro transactions,i don't think they have to be a bad thing,in moderation i'm fine with them and with some games they are the only way that dev can make their money back...but the problem is,just like other corporations in other areas of business,once
 the developers/studios/publishers see something that makes them more money,they agressively pursue that option more and more with all the other devs/studios/publishers around them picking up the micro transaction fever.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So basically,yeah gamers would have to unite in a big way to fight against them effectively,taking group action...but i don't think the tipping point has been reached yet...it may be the new gen of consoles might just bring that tipping point though=/</p>

<p>Just to add,in its own way it hurts diverse game development over time,as people pay ever more money into less games due to their fav games having microtransactions and they waste a lot of their spare cash on those,they aren't going to be buying the less
 popular games.Added to all the other problems that hurt diverse development,it has a cascade effect.Damn,for a popular mass hobby this stuff sure can get really expensive really fast.</p>

<p>There is some fierce competition in the gaming industry at the moment with the release of the next gen X-Box and PS. A lot of developers seem to be gambling a lot of money to try and gain as many fans but I think it will settle down after awhile once the
 players decide who's games they prefer. I think at the moment Activision and Ubisoft are probably two of the biggest. I don't mind Rockstar though. There more than likely will be some devs left behind once the next gen consoles come out tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yea the whole micro transaction thing bothers me as well... I don't mind them being in there, but I find it irritating that anytime someone finds a legit way to make money, they nerf it. &nbsp;I wouldn't say I would cheat to get money (although I understand why
 you think they deserve it), If it got that bad I would just stop playing the game. &nbsp;If you feel you can't win with their ever-changing rules, then stop playing their game altogether. &nbsp;It's a bad move to decide to just break their rules as pay back.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Like I said, I get micro-transactions and the devs trying to make an extra dime, but when a game has as many launch problems as this one did, and they kept doing updates to nerf payouts, not make fixes, it put a bad taste in most peoples' mouths. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don't find it too hard to make money through races. &nbsp;I haven't been on since last friday though, so if they nerfed the races I could be wrong, but last friday I was making anywhere from $3k to $10k per race, which seems reasonable. &nbsp;I
 think costing 2 to 3 races worth of 'income' to buy a gun attachment isn't too steep.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of an old saying. "If you can't beat em' join em'." Eventually this money exploit will be fixed. And by the sheer number of people doing it I have to assume R* wont be able to ban them all. Not unless they want to destroy their consumer base.</p>
<hr />
<p>To me all this talk of banning is to ease the minds of people who don't want to exploit the game or cheat. Which is nice of them I guess but its still empty promises.</p>
<hr />
<p>To be honest, this game is far too repetitive even with cheats and exploits. The only time I have fun now is goofing around in free roam with friends. Which I haven't done since Ghost came out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Not insulting CoD or CoD players. I like CoD. Its this generations most popular FPS. In 5 or so years it will be some other franchise people either love or hate. Just like Halo before CoD. But thats off topic...</p>
<hr />
<p>All I'm trying to say is, its just a game. If you're not having fun, its up to you to decide what to do. You have many options. All have meaningless consequences. So I can't say "choose wisely" as they're all wise decisions.</p>

<p>i've been doing a majority of survivals and 10+ lap races now to make money, you get 20k for beating survivals and on the longer races (anything over 5-10 minutes) you still get a decent payout so i may have been a little quick to jump the gun, yes it does
 take longer to make money now buts its still possible to do so.</p>
