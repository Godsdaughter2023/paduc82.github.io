<h2>            Windows Live virus</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>This Home use 32 bit machine, win 7 Pro with virtual XP, has an issue with windows live and updating windows.</p>

<p>Sometime ago when opening win live a window popped up saying windows live (wlive) needed updating.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The update removed the address book files.<span>&nbsp; </span>An external drive was used to reinstall the backup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since that time the popup has appeared when wlive was started and was ignored.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Today a new popup appeared, have Jpg with popup, this time wlive will not start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Signed in as administrator, normally sign in as Byron, could open wlive, no popup, normally and download mail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Later, after restart as administrator, new popup appears. When new popup is closed wlive will start after about 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>Have run multiple boot time scans with Avast up to date Internet program, no virus found.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Tried to run online Microsoft virus removal program, after download, get window ‘don’t have privilege to run program’.</p>

<p>Several attempts, have install log, have been made to install KB2686827 and KB2656368. Get message they are installed, when machine is shutting down machine attempts to install
 again.<span>&nbsp; </span>When restarted and search for update is made, list the same two files.</p>

<p>Have not attempted a reinstall of wlive, you might need additional files to analyze.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Byron

    <title>Darkening text on incoming mail in Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence a wilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Darkening text on incoming mail in Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>In an exchange on this forum in March 2013 you advised it was not then possible to darken the text on incoming mail but that you would refer it to MS for future action. It is now August 2015 - was it referred, has there been any action ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to darken incoming mail (no problem with my outgoing mail) - isn't it time this option was incorporated - like hundreds of others my vision is not perfect but with darkened text it is OK. The only way I can find to darken incoming mail
 is to forward it back to myself, having used the outgoing mail font option capabilities to darken it - yes, a pretty stupid way to have to achieve a result I agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice please</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot customize only incoming emails, the option is to change the color for all emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which you can find: <strong>Options &gt; Mail &gt; Font &gt; Color.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">By default, Windows Live Mail will show messages you receive in the font specified by the message. If no formatting information is specified (or if the email was sent in plain text), Windows Live Mail will use "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"
 for rich-format emails without font specified, and "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"&nbsp; for plain text messages. To change that, click on the "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">" menu (top left button), and go to
<strong>Options &gt; Mail</strong>: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the "<strong><span>Read</span></strong>" tab at the top, and click on the "<strong><span>Fonts</span></strong>" button at the bottom. A new dialog will open.<br />
<br />
Choose the default font family you want to use for rich-formatted messages by picking a different value from the "<strong><span>Proportional fonts</span></strong>" dropdown menu.<br />
<br />
For the default display font for plain-text emails, choose another value from the "<strong><span>Fixed-width fonts</span></strong>" dropdown.<br />
<br />
The default <strong><span>Font size</span></strong> is set to "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">", which corresponds to about
</span><code><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">12</span></code><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> point, pick another size, anywhere from "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">" to "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>OK</strong> to save your new settings, and
<strong>OK</strong> once more to return to Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other was changing the font size, if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. On Window Live Mail main window, click on <strong><span>File</span></strong> (or press
<strong><span>Alt+F</span></strong>).</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select <strong><span>Options</span></strong>, then click <strong><span>Mail</span></strong>. The
<strong><span>Options</span></strong> window will appear. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on the Compose tab. </span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on<strong><span>Font settings</span></strong> for Mail and change the settings as per your preference.</span></p>

                    As the title implies, the only hardware or software change made was changing the workgroup name from WORKGROUP to MSHOME so I could attempt to access shared files from a Windows XP Home Edition SP3 computer.&nbsp; Not only did it still not work, but now I have
 an even more severe problem: Windows is not stable like it used to be.&nbsp; For one thing, I can't open anything for about five minutes after logging in to my account so that an error about my webcam software could be detected.&nbsp; Otherwise, Explorer.exe stops responding,
 and using task manager to solve the issue causes a system crash and reboot.&nbsp; I don't have an error code for this particular crash, but it did say something about a critical process or thread not doing something (i forget what, though).&nbsp; And now, I was using
 my disk imaging software that came with my computer to burn and verify recorded data an ISO image, and during the verifying phase, I got another crash, and the only things that I recall were the

<p>Chances are that this change did not cause the problem - it is probably coincidental (as hard as that is for me to say) - because I can't see how the change could have such a profound effect.&nbsp; Have you tried changing it back to see if that resolves the problem
 - if not, please do so.&nbsp; We'll deal with the networking issues later if this puts things back to normal.&nbsp; Otherwise, read on.</p>
<p><span><span>Bluescrren errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information. We also need ALL the information about the other error messages you've received.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible:</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

 upload dmp, xmp,&nbsp;and txt files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you
 should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>Can you upload the contents of c:\windows\minidump to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and
 provide a link? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're getting a BAD_POOL_HEADER bugcheck, you're experiencing a crash due to memory corruption. This could be due to faulty hardware such as RAM, or due to a buggy or incompatible driver. &nbsp;In this case, check the items below for running chkdsk,
 sfc, and driver verifier. &nbsp;Driver Verifier is the proper thing to turn to for memory corruption issues such as this, and chkdsk and sfc can turn up disk or file corruption.</p>
<p>General guidance for dealing with memory corruption:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>For memory corruption cases such as you seem to be experiencing, it can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings- &gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select
 all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out &nbsp;of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot &nbsp;completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload it to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>,
 and provide a link.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily &nbsp;good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple
 of &nbsp;modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date (including video drivers), as well as ensuring that you're &nbsp;using the latest BIOS.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who have replied so far.&nbsp; I have taken No.Compromise's advice in two ways.&nbsp; I have ran sfc /scannow on my computer and I get an error after 20%, and a screen shot can be seen on my skydrive account.&nbsp; Also, in that same folder is a folder
 called Minidump which contains the content of C:\Windows\Minidump on my computer.&nbsp; I am almost wondering if my RAM is corrupted.&nbsp; First off, it takes a long time to boot during the scrolling bar thingy, and then, it takes even longer at the "Please wait..."
 screen.&nbsp; Also, could this be caused by malware (system restore says there are no restore points, but I have used System Restore on my PC before!)?&nbsp; I see there is also a new BIOS for my PC, the Toshiba Satellite P305D-S8900.&nbsp; Anyway, here is the link to my
 SkyDrive folder: <a href="http://cid-f199c02ed12c9628.office.live.com/browse.aspx/BSOD%5E_issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>For the SFC log - can you upload&nbsp;\windows\logs\cbs\cbs.log to your SkyDrive?</p>
<p>The dumps show characteristics of memory corruption - one crash was a&nbsp;BAD_POOL_HEADER (memory corruption), one was&nbsp;SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M due to an unhandled access violation that seemed to take place while you were shutting the system down,
 and one occurred because the client server runtime subsystem terminated prematurely with a bogus error code.</p>
<p>So, you can try enabling verifier on third-party drivers, as described, since that can help weed out memory corruption issues. &nbsp;Also give chkdsk a spin...</p>

<p>Hey Petkomirchev!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us! Just so we are on the same page when the adult account tries to set up the screen time for a minor account this issue comes up? Has it been attempted from a different browser (Microsoft Edge, Chrome,
 ect)?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also experiencing problems with the family code but for different reasons. I work with families, and they are looking tohabe the code removed. However, they do not remember the password nor the email that was origianlly used. Is there a way to reset
 or get rid of the password without actually having an email account with microsoft? It says you can change it online, however that requires an account.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey Aidan, Assuming the family code is on the Xbox 360 we do have a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/security/forgotten-parental-controls-pass-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Parental Controls troubleshooter</a>.</p>
<p><span>For forgotten pass codes for the Xbox 360, it can be reset by answering the pass code question created when the console and parental controls were first set up. In short, No, we do require a Microsoft account so we can register the console
 to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;I did not find an answer over at the Xbox forums. &nbsp;However, I do want to provide an update to help others out and to my question and the answer is yes, I took a chance and hooked up two wireless controllers on separate PCs. &nbsp;My
 two PCs are within 4 feet of each other and two people can each use their wireless controllers on each PC. &nbsp;On my Windows 7 64bit, Windows finds the proper drivers/software and installs. &nbsp;I just needed to sync each respectively.

            <p>The reason we did the system restore was because the power had gone off two times really fast while the computer was on.&nbsp; The computer wouldn't come back up.&nbsp; It said there were errors and various other messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow I finally got it to the screen where
 it said you could do the system restore, I got to the screen where I could pick dates from which to take the system back to restore.&nbsp; I tried the first one which was just like a week ago, it said there had been a windows update.&nbsp; It didn't work, so I went
 back to one in June, I think it was like June 24th of this year.&nbsp; I even did the check to see what programs would be effected and there were none.&nbsp; All my pictures and files were prior to this date, but now I can't find any of them.&nbsp; Thanks!!&nbsp; I hope I answered
 all your questions.</p>

            The power went off unexpectedly again and the computer shut off, came back up with&nbsp;the repairing message and then came to the screen where I could continue to windows 8.1 of which it won't do or go to the screen where you can do the various different repairs.&nbsp;
 When I try to click on any of those, it now says that you need to sign in as an administrator but there aren't any administrator accounts on this pc, so now I can't even do any of the refreshes or anything.&nbsp; How can I get around this to get our computer started
 again?&nbsp; I'm sure I am just buying time because it seems like this computer is dying a slow death, but is there a way to&nbsp;get&nbsp;around the administrator stuff.&nbsp; It must have wiped out this when it messed up the first time.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello LynnG1019,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same isue here. I was downloading a file last week and fell asleep.&nbsp; When I woke up, i remember unplugging my pc immediately without doing the normal shutdown.&nbsp; The next time i opened my pc,&nbsp; i saw a repair message completely similar to what you have experienced.&nbsp;
 Until now i still could not open my pc.&nbsp; The phrase "you need to sign in as an administrator but there aren't any administrator accounts on this pc" always displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask if you have already fixed your computer? If so, can you show me the procedure, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already brought my pc to the authorized service center. To my disappointment, the staff said they can't fix it because they are not familiar with the model. It's an All-in-one Lenovo C260 desktop. And the warranty covers only hardware, not software-related
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To Microsoft Support Engineer,</strong> please help.&nbsp; My important school files are stored in this pc&nbsp;and I have no back-up (so stupid of me).&nbsp; I can't afford to lose any of them as I am working on a thesis-related subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<h3> marc mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Install Windows Updates&#58; errors 80070002, 80070005, 80070643</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I began to receive errors in Windows Update after trying to install the latest Definition Update for Windows Defender. In the Windows Update interface, the error given was 80070002. I downloaded and ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter from Microsoft.</p>
<p>After it ran it said it fixed three issues:</p>
<p>1."Service registration is missing or corrupt"</p>
<p>2. error 80070005</p>
<p>3. "Problems installing recent updates."</p>
<p>I was only able to update the Defender definitions by manually downloading them. Even then, they would not install until after repeatedly double clicking the definitions file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later the same day I tried to update to the latest definitions again in WU to see if the problem was resolved. It was not. I was again given error 80070002. I ran the Troubleshooter a few more times and it kept saying the same thing as before. At that point
 I ran sfc /scannow in an Administrator command prompt and it said "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I ran </span>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and it said "The restore operation completed successfully. The component store corruption repaired. The operation completed successfully."
 &nbsp;Ran sfc /scannow again and this time was informed that "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations." I restarted my computer but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I manually reset WU following exactly the answer in this link:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/service-registration-is-missing-or-corrupt/6f96b72b-07fa-4d86-9c62-245217c1be12<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still did not work. I still received the same results from the WU Troubleshooter as before. When I look in the Event Viewer, I am instead given error&nbsp;0x80070643. The Source is WindowsUpdateClient and the Task is Windows Update Agent.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tried once more to update Defender definitions but this time in the Defender interface. It worked (it says definitions are up to date, with the latest version number), but then when I look at View update history in WU it says:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Installation status: Failed"<br />
"Error details: Code: 80070002"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the WU Troubleshooter<strong>&nbsp;again</strong>, and this time it gave me the same three issues/fixes as before but also a fourth: "Some security settings are missing or have been changed." But even after it says it's fixed, error 80070005 and&nbsp;"Problems
 installing recent updates" show up on a repeat scan. The Troubleshooter always says that the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the built in troubleshooter from Control Panel, and all it says is "Problems found: Windows Update components must be repaired" and "Fixed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end. I feel I have tried everything. The most persistent errors are 80070002 and 80070005. I have searched the web for solutions to these errors and have already tried them. They did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would gladly have done a System Restore right from the start, but to my dismay when I tried that it said "No System Restore Points have been created." This was alarming, especially since I knew for certain that I had about 5 restore points. I had even
 done a system restore two days prior.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already scanned with Windows Defender, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Hitman Pro, and Microsoft Safety Scanner. All scans were clean so I am pretty much certain it is not a vrius/malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help. I really want this issue to be resolved before the next Security Updates are released. I am afraid I will not be able to install them if WU keeps acting like this. I have had issues with WU before, but not for a long while and never this persistent.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just now tried to install the latest Windows Defender definition through the Windows Update interface with
<strong>both Defender's Real-Time Protection and the Windows Firewall turned of</strong><strong>f</strong> (turned them back on right after).
<strong>I still got the 80070002 error.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was however able to install it via the Windows Defender interface normally. As I stated in my original post, this already happened once before. In the first instance, Defender said the definitions were installed, but WU said it failed. This time, however,
 WU said the update still needed to be installed. When I clicked the Install button in WU, it instantaneously showed a successful installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>EDIT 12:24 Pacific Time: I was able to replicate the above event with KB2267602 (definition version: 1.239.762.0).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the article, but it was one of the first ones I found when I was looking for solutions and I have already followed all five steps, as described in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my issue. What else can I try to fix this?</p>

            <p>Well I'm not sure what happened, but after a couple days of not bothering I turned on my computer and updated Defender's virus definitions via Windows Update like usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said I don't know what happened. I did not try any further troubleshooting since my second post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did this problem stop all of a sudden? Of course I am a little relieved. I'm cautiously optimistic that it will stay like this but who knows. I was disappointed by the replies I got since they seemed to ignore my entire original post. I'm sorry I can't
 say what did or did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this common, that Windows errors like this disappear as quickly as they appear?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My System shuts itself off with no warning.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't know if this issue has been posted, but I'm gonna ask anyway.</p>
<p>I own an Xbox 360 Elite system, and live in Arizona.</p>
<p>My system until about a month ago worked perfectly fine and had no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a month ago I left to go to Anime Expo. I was gone a week. When I returned my 360 now will no longer stay on for extended periods of time. I will turn the system on, start to play a game, and within 5 minutes the system will turn itself off again.&nbsp;<br />
There are no red lights appearing when the system turns off, or any time after the system shuts off. It just shuts off.</p>
<p>I have taken it to a friend's house, with my own power block, and tried it there. It worked perfectly. So I am thinking that it has something to do with my household.</p>
<p>I am unsure of what it is. I have tried several different outlets in my home and get the same results.
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My ATI Display Driver isn&#39;t in the device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister bright  say:</h3>
<h2>            My ATI Display Driver isn&#39;t in the device manager</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea what is going on...<br />
<br />
I'm using an "HP Pavilion dv7-4180us Entertainment Notebook PC".&nbsp; My laptop has 2 settings for graphics and uses an "ATI Mobility Radeon 5650" for higher performance and "Intel HD Graphics" for lower end stuff.<br />
Essentially what happened was I was trying to play a PC game (the particular game was "7 Days to Die") like I tend to do when I have nothing else to do.&nbsp; I had the game in a smaller window so I could have a YouTube video running in the background.&nbsp; For some
 reason though, my screen went completely black and never came back.&nbsp; There was sound for a few moments before it stopped as well.&nbsp; I sat there and waited, but the picture never came back.&nbsp; I had to force the computer to turn off by holding the power button
 because nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
Usually, if the screen goes black unexpectedly, the picture will come back and i'll get a pop up that says "ATI display has crashed and has recovered", but that didn't happen and like I said, the picture never came back at all.&nbsp; There was no mouse or anything,
 just a completely black screen.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice it until today when I tried playing another game, but my computer was using the secondary, lower end graphics.&nbsp; I tried to switch back to my high performing ATI graphics and I couldn't.&nbsp; I went into the device manager like I was advised, but
 my problem became clear when I clicked on the Display adapter drop down...<br />
<br />
There is only 1 display adapter in my device manager now.&nbsp; The ATI display adapter isn't even there.<br />
<br />
I can't select my ATI graphics at all anymore and when I go to try and use the ATI software that came with my computer, it keeps telling me that there is no ATI graphics at all.&nbsp; I've tried installing the driver from the HP website, but it didn't seem to work
 at all.&nbsp; The ATI Auto Detect program says it can't find any driver whatsoever and that my operating system might not be supported.<br />
<br />
I've NEVER had this problem before and I have NO IDEA what is going on.&nbsp; I did absolutely nothing different from what I normally do.&nbsp; I didn't install any new programs at the time.&nbsp; I have no viruses (I use Malwarebytes anti malware and it doesn't find anything
 when I scan once a week).&nbsp; If anyone can help, i'd greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Does my computer just not recognize the graphics card anymore?&nbsp; Is my graphics card dead (if it is, why would it be)?&nbsp; What is happening?&nbsp; How do I fix this?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to find your graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused due to following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display adapter dead.</li><li>Display driver corrupt.</li><li>Recent changes made or updates installed.</li></ul>
<p>As per my understanding you are able to see only Intel display adapter from device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to do a system restore to an earlier date when things were working fine on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about system restore, refer to the below link:</p>

I guess that means the ATI display adapter is dead, right?

            <p>Hi bro..i have an Hp Pavillion dv6-3143se entertainment notebook pc with the same specs as you..</p>
<p>Me too have a problem with the ATI graphics card..it is also not showing in the device manager.. And i have a strange complaint also that my battery is not showing plugged in (charging)..it only shows how much battery is remaining. If the battery is full
 and i am still connecting my charger it will show 100% remaining.. I have browsed on many places to see a cure to this problem.. But it seems like i am the only &nbsp;one with this problem. So now my laptop shows i am working the laptop on battery even if i connect
 the charger. So computer disables ATI graphics and only works Intel Graphics. to save the power.. And sorry for my broken English.. :-)</p>

            Yeah my computer does the same thing right now.&nbsp; It doesn't show that the computer is plugged in even though it is plugged in, the battery charges and it can run off the AC Adapter alone.&nbsp; It only knows it's plugged in if the battery is removed all together.&nbsp;
 The way people say to fix it doesn't work for me so there is probably something else wrong with my computer (oh boy more problems).<br />
<br />
But even with that, there is supposed to be a way to switch between the 2 graphics I have; ATI and Intel.&nbsp; I can't switch to the ATI at all and it doesn't even show up, like it doesn't even exist anymore.&nbsp; You're supposed to be able to override which graphics
 you're using.&nbsp; I've had the ATI graphics going while on battery power and the Intel going while it's plugged in.&nbsp; I've taken the battery out to run off the AC Adapter alone, but it wouldn't change anything.

            What kind of internet connection do you have ? ADSL, dial-up, etc.. ? If the connection is very slow and the line is noisy, you may encounter some problems. If download gets corrupted, it may restart instead of resuming, I believe.

            the speed for download is i think 150-200 KB per second base on my observation from the past few days of downloading certain files. It is slow compare to other connections?

download Windows 10</a>&nbsp;directly and create an installation media, either a bootable DVD disk or bootable USB flash disk about 4 GB in size.</p>

            <p>Sorry. Flash disk is the same as flash drive. You can use it to install Windows 10. All you will do is, while Windows 7 is running, open flash drive and click/double-click setup.exe file.This will upgrade your Windows 7 to Windows 10. You do not need a product
 key&nbsp;to install&nbsp;Windows 10 and it will not ask you for one. </p>

            What exactly is a "misaligned file"?&nbsp; Which program is reporting these "errors"?&nbsp; I've never heard of such a thing on any Windows operating system on any file system.<br />
<br />
From a quick search on the net I see that this might be reported by System Mechanic.&nbsp; To permanently fix this stop trying to "realign" files and fretting over nonexistent problems and get rid of these useless tune up utilities which report these bogus errors!&nbsp;

<p>I'm currently doing some external studies, and they've ask me to show i can remove drivers from my laptop, i have a toshiba satellite, and im running windows 7, but the only thing i can find it to use the print management and remove the print server from
 the management, but when i went into admin tools there was no print management, so can i still&nbsp;remove my drivers?</p>

<h2>            Windows7 Home edition&#58; Language bar still missing after adding multiple languages</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hi this is the standard procedure given:</strong></p>
<p>If the Language bar isn't listed in the Toolbars menu, you don't have multiple input languages installed on your computer. You need to add additional languages using Region and Language in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to add an input language:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open Region and Language by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Region and Language.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click the Keyboards and Languages tab, and then click Change keyboards.<br />
3.&nbsp;Under Installed services, click Add.<br />
4.&nbsp;Double-click the language you want to add, double-click Keyboard, select the text services options you want to add, and then click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have added multiple languages (English UK, Chinese Simplified, Japanese), language bar still did not appear on taskbar</strong></p>
<p>If you don't see the Language bar, right-click the taskbar, point to Toolbars, and then click Language bar. For more information about the language bar, refer the article below for more info:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Language bar still did not appear in Toolbars after multiple languages have been added.&nbsp; I'm resorted to using Tablet PC Input Panel.&nbsp; Please advise!</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be related to drivers and could be resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that
 you want to use won't work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm the same, start the Computer in low-resolution video mode. This starts Windows using your current video driver and using low resolution and refresh rate settings.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>This option is available in Advanced startup options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start you computer in low-resolution video mode, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Enable low-resolution video (640×480), and then press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem doesn't reappear in low-resolution mode, then the issue is driver related. You can resolve this by downloading display card driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and update the chipset, display and graphic drivers to the latest one for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer: Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:322756 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756 / ) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</p>

<h2>            MODDERS need to be banned&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>hello i am just writing to ask why there is so many modders on xbox live and microsoft dose nothing about it.</p>
<p>this is redicoulus. i am going to consider canceling my membership if this crap goes on. you guys have the worst customer service i have ever experienced. i am playing grand theft auto 4 and i cant find one game were i don't get killed by players who have
 mods and than they just freeze the game. this is ruining the gaming eperience for everybody. stupid modders need to go to PC if they love mods so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because they are the ones who ban people. and i get so tired of them. they are so busy banning the accounts of innocent gamers who have not done nothing. but they let most of the modders and cheaters run free to do what ever they want.
</p>
<p>for example: there was a modder in my GTA game. and i was trash talking to him and then i end up getting a message from &nbsp;a microsoft admin who says he will suspend me for my trash talking. WTF? so than i look at the modders friend list and who do i see?
 the admin! and i had proof that he was an admin. so he was not lying about that. he was just trying to defend a modder. and the ironic thing is, they became friend over a time were he suspended the modder for modding. and yet hes doing it again and the admin
 dosn't care. and my friend said the same exact thing happend to him with some other admin and another modder. MS is more on the modders side these days.</p>
<p>thats why i hate MS. they ban people but they don't ban the correct people. they don't ban modders like they should. they even suspended me ones for 3 weeks for having a bad word on my bio that was cencored. and they did not even send me a warning message.
 they are so lazy at their job. i love MS but for real this is not acceptable. and i am trying to find out were i can send a message to the enforcment team but i cant find the link to that.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey now, don't try making him feel special with that -1 when you've given out dozens of them already. &nbsp;Might give the poor guy the wrong idea. &nbsp;And by the way, if I understand correctly and you just said you reported someone on here for something they
 did on youtube, and they got banned, then they did something on here too. &nbsp;The enforcement team doesn't accept youtube vids as evidence. &nbsp;Too easy to tamper with, they say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to address the OP's issues a bit, he did say he couldn't find one game where he wasn't killed by a modder, so yes, I'd say it's a bit hard for him to find a lobby without one. &nbsp;In all fairness, just spend a little time even reading the forums and
 you'll know that a few games are fairly riddled with modder, GTA4 being one of them, I believe. &nbsp;Seems some games won't be patched, ever, due to newer versions coming out and getting all the attention from the developers. &nbsp;And those games then become a modders
 paradise, where it's an uphill battle to ban them all. &nbsp;As for contacting the enforcement team, you pretty much can't. &nbsp;You can post in the banned account or banned console sections if you've been banned, and they'll reply, but that's all. &nbsp;You can't get any
 sort of private message to them if that's what you're hoping.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IP address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. To address your concern, it would be best to contact your
 Internet Service Provider who can walk you through resetting your IP address.</p>

<p>It would have been better if you had provided the exact text of the error message.&nbsp; Typically, the problem with wireless printers and IP addresses doesn't produce an error as you describe.&nbsp; Rather, the job appears to print but nothing happens at the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wireless printer typically is connected on your "local network" and that local network is managed by your wireless router (which you may think of as your "modem").&nbsp; Each device on the local network has an "IP address" so that other network devices can
 find and communicate with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most wireless printers are configured by default to have their IP address automatically assigned by your router.&nbsp; When you first install the printer, the router assigns it an IP address, then your computer "discovers" the printer at that IP address, and
 then the Windows printing system is configured to send print jobs to that IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for any reason (and there can be several), the router assigns a different IP address to the printer, print jobs sent by your computer to the printer's old IP address never get to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your <strong>computer's </strong>IP address (which is what the link suggested to you does), will have absolutely no effect on the above problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If following the instructions at that link do not help, please post back with the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The complete text of the error message, if any, that you receive when you try to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The IP address assigned to your printer.&nbsp; You can determine this by using the printer's front panel controls.&nbsp; The process you need to follow will be described in your printer's User Guide.&nbsp; If you can't figure it out, provide the make and specific model
 of your printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; The IP address that your computer is configured to use for the printer.&nbsp; You can determine this as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go go Devices and Printers, right-click on the icon for your printer, and select "Printer properties"</li><li>Select the "Ports" tab</li><li>Report the value in the "Port" column for the line that is highlighted and checked.&nbsp; You may have to click and drag on the faint vertical line in the header row of that table between "Port" and "Description" in order to see the full width of the "Port"
 column</li></ul>
<p>4.&nbsp; Your computer's IP information.&nbsp; You can determine this as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Command Prompt window by clicking Start, typing cmd.exe in the Search box, and pressing Enter</li><li>type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line<br />
