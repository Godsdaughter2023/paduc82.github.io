                    <p>Original Title: Phantom icon on the taskbar?</p>
<p>I have the following problem.Some kind of icon very shortly appears in task bar,approximately every half hour.That keep it very short, less than a second and then disappears.It looks like a gear, as icons of "services".The system is otherwise stable, there
 is no slowdown, but I'm interested what it is, maybe not a virus or spyware program and how to solve it?I have a Windows 7 professional,32bit.</p>

    <title>Win 10 User account inaccessible after renaming the &#34;full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loganmcdaniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 User account inaccessible after renaming the &#34;full name&#34; in netplwiz</h2>
                    <p>Today, on my windows 10 laptop, I was personalizing my background and lockscreen backgrounds when I foolishly thought to myself "hmm. My full name on the sign in screen is a bit long, maybe I should shorten it to just my first name." Evidently, and to my
 dismay, I used an improper method of doing so and after signing out to check the results my user was no longer on the list of users available to log in as. Here are the steps I took to cause this issue and what I've tried to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Used Run (Windows + R) to start netplwiz</p>
<p>2. In the properties of my main account under the Full Name category changed "First Last" to "First".</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Note: There are 2 of my account, one with a user icon next to a monitor and one with a user icon next to an earth. The one I changed was the one next to the monitor. (Presumably these are seperate for cloud sync and local account as the properties page
 of the cloud sync one doesn't have a general tab with the user name, full name, and description boxes.)</p>
<p>3. Signed out to check the change and to my horror my account was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If i go into system properties (run&nbsp;sysdm.cpl) and in the advanced tab click "settings" the box under user profiles my profile is still listed but with the size as ?. Also concerning in this box is that the type and status are "Local" when my account
 is through my hotmail.. Oddly the same goes with this account.. Maybe I forgot to ever verify my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The user folder in C:/Users/* is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>POSSIBLE SPECIFIC ISSUE FOUND?</p>
<p>Okay so on inspection of the netplwiz box I found that the working user on this computer is assigned to the groups HomeUsers; Administrators; AND Users; to my best recollection I believe my account was too but when applying the changed Full Name in the group
 membership tab I believe windows reset the users groups to be only the one that was checked, HomeUsers, leaving me unable to sign in to this profile.</p>
<p>Help would be MUCH appreciated, as this is my day to day web browsing device I'd like to have this resolved as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I seem to have found the solution and indeed the issue was that my account was removed from the groups users and administrators. I fixed this issue by logging on to a different admin account and in an elevated command promt ran these 2 commands.</p>
<p>net localgroup Users *username* /add</p>
<p>net localgroup Administrators *username* /add</p>

<h2>            Upgrade from standard Skype account to Skype for Business</h2>
                    I have a standard Skype account with a purchased Skype Out number. I want to know how I can upgrade to Skype for Business (I want the ability to record a customer voicemail message), but I do not want to lose my existing Skype Out number. I cannot find
 a way to do this without fear of losing some existing functionality or service. Thanks.

            Hi AmandaGillam,<br />
<br />
Skype for Business and Skype are vastly different in their features, functions and service. Since, both are different platform and service it's not feasible to directly upgrade from standard Skype account to Skype for Business.<br />
<br />
Consumer Skype that you use at home is great for smaller businesses of up to 20 employees. It is free to use, unless you want to buy credit to make calls to landlines and mobiles.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Skype for Business lets you add up to 250 people to online meetings, provides enterprise-grade security, allows you to manage employee accounts, and is integrated into your Office apps.<br />
<br />
Skype for Business is part of the Office 365 suite of services. To set up Skype for Business you need to subscribe Office 365 Business subscription such as (Office 365 Business Premium or Business Essentials). Here is the article for your reference:

Set up Skype for Business Online</a><br />
<br />
You can transfer your phone numbers from your current service provider to Skype for Business. See

<h2>            Windows 10 - Display problems</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; The only problem is that the display will not work on full screen.&nbsp; It will only display properly when the monitor is directly set to aspect, which results in two black bars on the side.&nbsp; The monitor is an Acer p206hv
 and the driver is a generic PnP.&nbsp; I have tried updating the driver, but it tells me it is up to date.&nbsp; The only adjustment in the display settings is changing the resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the make and model of the graphic card driver?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This could be an issue with Graphic Card Drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue visit the graphic card manufacturer support site and install the latest drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are not able to find the latest graphic card drivers install the current driver in the compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue you may try to install the currently available driver from the manufacturer’s website, however make sure to run the driver in compatibility mode for your earlier
 version Operating System. For example if you upgraded from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, you may run the driver in compatibility mode for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so you may follow the steps as per the following Microsoft Article:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a><br />

<p><span>Hope the above steps help.

            Hi WilliamMitchell6 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You will receive call on your Skype client anywhere in the world. (China has its own restrictions on various online services including Skype, so I am not sure whether China blocks Skype calls or not)

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse doesn&#39;t connect in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;just updated to windows 10 and as usual problems of upgrade start to show up :D, where my Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse doesn't want to connect.&nbsp;The problem in more detail is as&nbsp;following:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The device is detected in Mange Bluetooth devices successfully. </p>
<p>* I got the ready to pair button&nbsp;. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;The device is&nbsp;paired successfully. </p>
<p>* The device is connected successfully for a couple of second then disconnect and show the paired status. However,&nbsp;the device is on and it was just connected for this&nbsp;seconds.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did all the possibilities to solve this issue however, no luck :(. Again in detail:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;I removed every thing the driver and&nbsp;the device then &nbsp;reinstall&nbsp;every thing.
</p>
<p>* I installed the lasted driver "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, when I open Microsoft Mouse and keyboard center and click support and don't see my device. it says "You may be using a non-Microsoft device or an unsupported Microsoft device"&nbsp;, such a smart answer!!!!!! :(. The OS doesn't give me any option to
 debug or troubleshooting the issue and try to understand why it disconnect and display paired status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse was working fine on windows 7 just before upgrading to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue, the scrolling in the touchpad stop working after upgrading too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem with my laptop. it is Sony VAIO s-Series Model VPCSE 32FX. windows 10 pro 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you in advance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best, </p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I manged to solve the second problem as per your advice in method 2. The first method could n't troubleshooting the mouse problem and it keep asking me to restart my PC. Even when I restart and rerun it again it told me restart! moreover, it recover the
 touchpad scroll problem again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I solved the first problem by removing the sony&nbsp;VAIO Smart Network program which seems to conflict with windows 10 but the mouse lose connection after PC sleep!!</p>
<p>The funny thing here is that, when I tried to uninstall this program, windows closes the installer and said this program is not supported in windows 10 (I am removing it Mr. windows!!!) so I had to delete the files in program file dir.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi SuccesFullGamer 
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows . . . 
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi, SuccesFullGamer 
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Main causes of this error: configuration of the Windows Store, lack of updates, time, language and region of the system. Therefore, I recommend you perform the following maintenance options: 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Reconfigure the Windows Store. 
<br />
<br />1. Download and run the problem solver for applications and the Windows Store: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a> 
<br />
<br />2. Manually restore store settings: 
<br />
<br />a) Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run window. 
<br />
<br />b) Type wsreset.exe and press the Enter key to execute the command. 
<br />
<br />3. Wait for the process to finish, restart your computer and check that it has been fixed. 
<br />
<br />Option 2: Install pending updates. 
<br />
<br />1. Under Start, type updates and select the option Check for updates. 
<br />
<br />3. Wait for the process to finish and restart your computer. To do so, follow the instructions: 
<br />
<br />to. Press the [Windows] + [X] keys, point to the option called Shut down or log out and click on the option called Restart. 
<br />
<br />b. Wait for the process to finish and do not force the shutdown, because the system can take advantage of that moment to install and configure pending updates. 
<br />
<br />Option 3: set the time, language and region of the system. 
<br />
<br />1. Click on the Start button and select the option called Settings. 
<br />
<br />2. Select the option called Time and Language. 
<br />
<br />3. Configure the Time Zone: 
<br />
<br />4. Then configure the Country or region: 
<br />
<br />5. Finally, restart  
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi SuccesFullGamer
<br />
<br />Yes, it is as I explained, you are running the Enterprise Edition of Windows 10, which is a volume licence and cannot be used by the private individual, because the licence will require regular rearming.
<br />
<br />Is there a Windows sticker on the casing of our device and if so what exactly is printed on that sticker?

            Hi SuccesFullGamer
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC and was Windows 10 ever re-installed by a PC Repair shop?
<br />
<br />Somewhere along the way someone installed a non genuine version of Windows. Most likely your Windows licence is for the Home or possibly the Pro version of Windows, but it is not for the Enterprise version . . .
<br />
<br />This may have happened some time ago, and it is possible your Windows was activated with a KMS Emulator like KMSPico or Microsoft Toolkit.
<br />
<br />Windows Updates have picked up on this and marked the OS ad not genuine.
<br />
<br />What needs to be done is to find out what version (Home, Pro . . .etc.) was originally installed on that PC and that version needs to be clean installed to get back to genuine Windows 10 . ..

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A PCI device driver is the program that allows a PCI device to function as intended. Different PCI devices use different drivers. If you receive an error message about a driver, it may have become corrupted or uninstalled. In this case, you need
 simply to determine the manufacturer of the device, then visit that company's website to obtain the driver. Basically, all the drivers associated with the mother board drivers of the computer&nbsp;are PCI drivers.&nbsp;PCI drivers enable devices and software applications
 on your computer system to operate mutually.</p>

<h2>            Problem Streaming Content in Windows 7</h2>
                    About a week ago, I installed Windows 7, upgrading from Windows Vista. I kept all my programs and settings. Now, whenever I attempt to stream content (Audio or Video) off the internet (Youtube, Hulu, Hulu Desktop, Blip.tv, Rhapsody, etc) the program I
 am using to access said content immediately crashes. I am using Firefox as my internet browser, but the problem persists if I use IE 8.

<p>
<span>Hi thublihnk,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Which edition of Operating system are you using? Is it a 32-bit or a 64-bit Operating system?</span></p>
<p>
<span>First, I suggest you to download and install the latest version of Flash Player by visiting the following link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</span></a></span></p>
<span>Method 1:
</span><span>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode
</span>
<p><span>Internet Explorer add-ons, such as ActiveX controls and browser toolbars, are used by some Web sites to provide an enhanced browsing
 experience. An error may occur if an add-on is damaged or if an add-on conflicts with Internet Explorer. To determine whether the error is caused by an add-on, run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, and then type
<span>Internet Explorer</span> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box.
</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong><span>Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons)</span></strong>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
</span></li><li><span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 4.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If no errors occur, the problem is caused by one of the add-ons that typically load together with Internet Explorer. In this case, use one
 of the following options. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Method 2: Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue</span>
<p><span><br />
Use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer 8 to individually disable each add-on to determine which add-on is causing errors. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Internet Explorer 8.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong>, point to <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong> , and then click
<strong>Enable or Disable Add-ons</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>In the
<strong>Show</strong> box, select <strong>Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer</strong> to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</span>
</li><li><span>For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click
<strong>Disable</strong> under <strong>Settings</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>When you have disabled all the items in this list, click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>Exit and then restart Internet Explorer 8.</span>
</li><li><span>If issues do not occur, repeat steps 1 through 3.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<strong>Enable</strong> for a single add-on.</span> </li><li>
<span>Repeat steps 6 through 8 until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on. Or, you
 can uninstall the software that installs the add-on.</span></p>
<span>Method 3: Reset Internet Explorer 8 settings</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and
 other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To do this, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p>
<span>1.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer 8.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Under
<strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong>, click <strong>Reset</strong>.</span></p>

            <p>We've heard about Microsoft's Windows 8 Resilient File System (ReFS)
<a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsofts-new-windows-8-resilient-file-system-refs-will-be-server-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
before</a>, but Microsoft revealed the specifics of its next-generation file system in full today. Microsoft's "designed from the ground up" ReFS has been created to meet today and tomorrow's needs for Windows storage — the ability to handle large volumes,
 resiliency to corruption, and shared storage pools across machines. ReFS will only be available inside Windows Server 8, so the vast majority of Windows 8 users will not benefit from its improvements at launch — Microsoft has plans to test it fully before
 making it available to Windows 8 client users.</p>
<p>ReFS simply plugs into the storage stack like any existing file systems, and is built on the foundations of NTFS to maintain elements of compatibility. ReFS and Storage Spaces, a feature
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2012/1/6/2686840/windows-8-storage-spaces-disk-pooling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft detailed recently</a>, were forged to complement each other for a complete storage system overhaul in Windows 8. The main advantages of the new file system include the ability for Windows 8 to detect all forms of disk corruption, data striping support
 for performance, and an allocate on write model known as copy-on-write. Microsoft has used copy-on-write (COW) concepts in its SQL Server products and Volume Shadow Copy Service previously, enabling quick snapshots of large data sets.</p>
<p>ReFS cannot be used on removable media, nor can it be used to boot an operating system — it's simply for storage right now. Microsoft says the new file system will only be introduced as part of Windows Server 8,
 but Windows 8 client will be able to access and read ReFS volumes until it's fully supported in client operating systems in the future. If you want the full lowdown on ReFS then hit the source link for a detailed explanation from Microsoft's Storage and File
 System team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>We wanted to continue our dialog about data storage by talking about the next generation file system being introduced in Windows 8.&nbsp; Today, NTFS is the most widely used, advanced, and feature rich file system in broad use. But when you’re reimagining
 Windows, as we are for Windows 8, we don’t rest on past successes, and so with Windows 8 we are also introducing a newly engineered file system. ReFS, (which stands for Resilient File System), is built on the foundations of NTFS, so it maintains crucial compatibility
 while at the same time it has been architected and engineered for a new generation of storage technologies and scenarios. In Windows 8, ReFS will be introduced only as part of Windows Server 8, which is the same approach we have used for each and every file
 system introduction. Of course at the application level, ReFS stored data will be accessible from clients just as NTFS data would be. As you read this, let’s not forget that NTFS is by far the industry’s leading technology for file systems on PCs.
</i></p>
<p><em>This detailed architectural post was authored by<b> Surendra Verma</b>, a development manager on our Storage and File System team, though, as with every feature, a lot of folks contributed. We have also used the FAQ approach again in this post.

</blockquote>
<p>In this blog post I’d like to talk about a new file system for Windows. This file system, which we call ReFS, has been designed from the ground up to meet a broad set of customer requirements, both today’s and tomorrow’s, for all the different ways that
 Windows is deployed.</p>
<p>The key goals of ReFS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a high degree of compatibility with a subset of NTFS features that are widely adopted while deprecating others that provide limited value at the cost of system complexity and footprint.</li><li>Verify and auto-correct data. Data can get corrupted due to a number of reasons and therefore must be verified and, when possible, corrected automatically. Metadata must not be written in place to avoid the possibility of “torn writes,” which we will talk
 about in more detail below.</li><li>Optimize for extreme scale. Use scalable structures for everything. Don’t assume that disk-checking algorithms, in particular, can scale to the size of the entire file system.</li><li>Never take the file system offline. Assume that in the event of corruptions, it is advantageous to isolate the fault while allowing access to the rest of the volume. This is done while salvaging the maximum amount of data possible, all done live.</li><li>Provide a full end-to-end resiliency architecture when used in conjunction with the Storage Spaces feature, which was co-designed and built in conjunction with ReFS.</li></ul>
<p>The key features of ReFS are as follows (note that some of these features are provided in conjunction with Storage Spaces).</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata integrity with checksums</li><li>Integrity streams providing optional user data integrity</li><li>Allocate on write transactional model for robust disk updates (also known as copy on write)</li><li>Large volume, file and directory sizes</li><li>Storage pooling and virtualization makes file system creation and management easy</li><li>Data striping for performance (bandwidth can be managed) and redundancy for fault tolerance</li><li>Disk scrubbing for protection against latent disk errors</li><li>Resiliency to corruptions with "salvage" for maximum volume availability in all cases</li><li>Shared storage pools across machines for additional failure tolerance and load balancing</li></ul>
<p>In addition, ReFS inherits the features and semantics from NTFS including BitLocker encryption, access-control lists for security, USN journal, change notifications, symbolic links, junction points, mount points, reparse points, volume snapshots, file IDs,
 and oplocks.</p>
<p>And of course, data stored on ReFS is accessible through the same file access APIs on clients that are used on any operating system that can access today’s NTFS volumes.</p>
Key design attributes and features
<p>Our design attributes are closely related to our goals. As we go through these attributes, keep in mind the history of producing file systems used by hundreds of millions of devices scaling from the smallest footprint machines to the largest data centers,
 from the smallest storage format to the largest multi-spindle format, from solid state storage to the largest drives and storage systems available. Yet at the same time, Windows file systems are accessed by the widest array of application and system software
 anywhere. ReFS takes that learning and builds on it. We didn’t start from scratch, but reimagined it where it made sense and built on the right parts of NTFS where that made sense. Above all, we are delivering this in a pragmatic manner consistent with the
 delivery of a major file system—something only Microsoft has done at this scale.</p>
Code reuse and compatibility
<p>When we look at the file system API, this is the area where compatibility is the most critical and technically, the most challenging. Rewriting the code that implements file system semantics would not lead to the right level of compatibility and the issues
 introduced would be highly dependent on application code, call timing, and hardware. Therefore in building ReFS, we reused the code responsible for implementing the Windows file system semantics. This code implements the file system interface (read, write,
 open, close, change notification, etc.), maintains in-memory file and volume state, enforces security, and maintains memory caching and synchronization for file data. This reuse ensures a high degree of compatibility with the features of NTFS that we’re carrying
 forward.</p>
<p>Underneath this reused portion, the NTFS version of the code-base uses a newly architected engine that implements on-disk structures such as the Master File Table (MFT) to represent files and directories. ReFS combines this reused code with a brand-new engine,
 where a significant portion of the innovation behind ReFS lies. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Reliable and scalable on-disk structures
<p>On-disk structures and their manipulation are handled by the on-disk storage engine. This exposes a generic key-value interface, which the layer above leverages to implement files, directories, etc. For its own implementation, the storage engine uses
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=356770.356776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B+ trees</a> exclusively. In fact, we utilize B+ trees as the single common on-disk structure to represent all information on the disk. Trees can be embedded within other trees (a child
 tree’s root is stored within the row of a parent tree). On the disk, trees can be very large and multi-level or really compact with just a few keys and embedded in another structure. This ensures extreme scalability up and down for all aspects of the file
 system. Having a single structure significantly simplifies the system and reduces code. The new engine interface includes the notion of “tables” that are enumerable sets of key-value pairs. Most tables have a unique ID (called the object ID) by which they
 can be referenced. A special object table indexes all such tables in the system.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Settings and Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scarletaurora  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Settings and Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 about a month ago and, generally speaking, I'm really happy with it. However, there are a few things that are still bugged and that I have no idea how to fix. Would anybody be able to help me restore/fix the following problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows Settings:If I click on the Windows Button and from there click on "Settings", a white window pops up for about a millisecond and then disappears again. I searched the internet for problems and some people said that it opens up out of screen for
 them. It was suggested that they put the settings button/app on the task bar and then resize/recenter it from there. That did not work for me. The window does not stay open, but rather, it's as if the settings app shuts down again. I was hoping that this may
 be patched through an update, but that seems to have some issues of it's own (point 3).
<br />
</p>
<p>2. Display Settings/Personalize</p>
<p>When I right-click the desktop and go to either "Display Settings" or "Personalize" to change my screen resolution, first/second screen, or desktop background, I receive the following message in a pop-up window:</p>
<p>"ms-settings:display<br />
This file does not have a program associated with it for performng this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click "Personalize", it's the same message, though the title is then "ms-settings:personalization-background".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have been able to work around this by going the "long route" through the control panel and changing it via the Display option there, however, it would be much more convenient if I were able to use the right-click option from the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Windows Updates</p>
<p>I receive the automatic windows updates as are customary for Windows 10. However, after they are downloaded, installed, and the computer reboots, I receive a message in the bottom right corner that says something to the tune of "there has been an error with
 the update, please click on this message to resolve". When I click on that message, nothing happens. No windows pop up or whatever. I've tried looking through the obvious places in the control panel for the update option, to possibly force an update or look
 through the update error messages, though so far I have yet to find anything to help. I fear the option I'm looking for is in the non-existant Settings option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody will be able to help me! Thank you in advance!</p>

            I noticed that this update contained a large number of files so it appears that it must be very complex.&nbsp; Do you have any information as to if and when Microsoft will fix this update and release it again?&nbsp; It appears that the restrictions that are in place
 limit the user to only one remote desktop login at a time whether that is in other Windows 7 computers or in XP computers.&nbsp; If it was just limited to XP computers then I could see a possible defense about XP being now in the paid only custom support but since
 it affects Windows 7 computers which are still in mainstream support then I feel this issue needs to be addressed promptly.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your time and understanding of this important issue in your operating system.<br />

            Had the same issue. &nbsp;Was using RDP to access a Win7 box internal to our network and after the update the RDP client would open and say connecting... for about 1 second then just close with no errors. &nbsp;Had to uninstall the update and RDP went back to working.
 &nbsp;Also noticed a few updates this month tied to RDP 8.1. &nbsp;I skipped them all so I don't end up back in the same situation. &nbsp;

            The quality assurance of patches seems to have gone down significantly with employee cutbacks at major companies.&nbsp; This is not just a Microsoft problem but an Apple problem as well as demonstrated with IOS 8.x update that disabled calling on their new
 Iphone 6 but fortunately Apple quickly patched the problem.&nbsp; However, with the proper testing of patches the issue should not have happened in the first place.&nbsp; I am now taking a more active wait and see method to see if users are posting problems to Microsoft
 patches before patching the computer network.&nbsp; This is unfortunate because it causes risk to go up but you still want your network to be working effectively.&nbsp; In my opinion, it is all about balancing the risks to network stability with the importance of patching
 your network.

                    <p>My Acer Aspire One 722 (Windows10) stopped recognizing the built-in screen a while ago. It always assumes the second screen is the primary screen - even when there is none connected. The only way I can get it &nbsp;to boot to built-in screen is tapping F2 while
 turning it on after removing the battery. And that doesn't always work. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> meowhaha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ntoskrnl.exe corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Two days ago this started happening where I'd start my computer and it would take me to advanced troubleshooting​. And NOTHING works. Not reset, not system restore, not start up repair, not go back to previous build, not even ANY if the start up settings
 work! I clicked on every single one and none of them did what they were supposed to. Command Prompt works but I need to know which commands to type in. I do some digging and I find that "boot critical file D:\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe is corrupt." I would
 rather not have to reinstall Windows, I want a quick solution. And if there are any commands, I'm sorry for being bossy but I would appreciate it if they were given in the EXACT way I'm supposed to type it in. Thank you so much...</p>

            <p>You can get Xbox One SmartGlass for Android (4.0 and above), iOS and Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>If you have a phone or tablet running any of these, just search in their respective stores (Play, App Store, Windows Phone Store) for the app and once downloaded you can log in there and view all the stats you wish.</p>

            <p>Hi Mollie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you find a resolution for the issue. Before we begin, I will need to ask a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Since when are you facing the issue?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you aware of any changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I would suggest you to reset Windows store and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Click on Windows +R</div>
</li><li>
<div>Type
<b>wsreset.exe</b></div>
</li><li>
<div>Hit Enter</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</li></ul>
<p>Check If the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try the steps from the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists run the App troubleshooter and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps and do let us know I f you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

                    It's been telling me "please try again later code: 80151103" for two days now. When I call support they tell me to give it a day or two, so I was thinking maybe someone else from Xbox would have a more constructive idea then hope for the best.

<p>That error code is usually referring to logging into XBox Live or recovering an account. Because you did't specify, I will assume that you are trying to log into XBox Live.It's possible that your profile has been corrupted.</p>
<p>First off, DON'T DELETE YOUR PROFILE!</p>
<p>When offline, plug in a flash drive and set it up for use with the XBox. Move your profile onto it, and then sign out if you got signed in at all.</p>
<p>Now try to recover your account through XBox Live. If you get the same error, it's possible that your account has been locked out for some reason, and you will need to call XBox support again to verify if it is or not.</p>

            <p>1. I actually have a desktop that I built. It has a Realtek Audio Driver built in and it is fully updated from ASUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My headphones are the Skullcandy Crushers 2013. The mic is in the headphones and the button to turn it on is on the wire that plugs into the 3.5 hole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes, but they don't have mics.</p>

            The headphones/mike combo requires a special port that is both input and output. Input for the mike and output for the sound. The headphone port on a desktop is output only. According to a review
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423754,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE </a>the mike is only for mobile devices like phones that have that type of dual port, not desktop computers. Use the headphones and add a separate mike connected to the mike input on the sound
 card.

<h2>            Chinese Language Pack</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after the recent Windows update, the Chinese Simplified language pack doesn't seem to work anymore. I was trying to type in Simplified Chinese but somehow the machine is outputting Traditional characters. I have tried reinstalling the language pack,
 and restarting my computer but still no luck.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />First of all, read this guide : <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/switch-between-languages-using-the-language-bar-1c2242c0-fe15-4bc3-99bc-535de6f4f258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/switch...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, I ask you if can you see Chinese from the keyboard languages icon. To see which keyboard are you on, you have to click on right bottom, where you see ENG or the abbreviation of your language. It will show a list of keyboards installed. If Chinese is in this list, pick it up, then try to write.
<br />
<br />P.s: Please, if the answer resolve your issue, click on Yes. Thanks.
