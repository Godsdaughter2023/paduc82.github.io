<p>
</p><p>So what exactly are you trying to merge into what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To extend into another partition which is after the partition that you want to extend&nbsp;you first have to delete that partition you want to extend into, which then becomes unallocated space.</p>
<p>THEN you extend into that unallocated space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows you what to do.</p>
<p>8/8.1 is the same method as 7 using Disk Management:</p>

<p>I deleted the partition and it became Unallocated Space but I couldn't Extend it by Right clicking on the C drive, Extend option is still dimmed, why it has to be to the right of Extended partition, is there a solution?</p>
<p>Unfortunately Microsoft creates a Reserved partition after Windows 8 installation while they can merge it into the same boot and active partition, I was urged to use internet documentation and delete this partition by copying it's contents to c drive and
 doing some command line stuff but now I have reached to another limitation but fortunately by downloading a third party partition manager I could merge it to other drive and get rid of it</p>

            <p><span>In disk management, you can only extend partition using the unallocated space next to its right side. so even if you shrink D: drive, the option to extend
</span><span>C: drive</span><span> is still grayed out. You have to delete a contiguous partition, before you can merge partitions in Disk Management. therefore, My suggestion is to use
</span><span>a third</span><span> party software, AOMEI Partition Assistant, both the standard (free) or the Professional(paid) version will do. you can use it to either move the unallocated space and extend partition with disk Management
 or directly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.disk-partition.com/help/merge-partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">merge partitions</a>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even though you&nbsp;will not lose the data&nbsp;in the process, be sure to backup any data on the disk that you cannot lose first just to be safe in case something happens. Say a power outage while in the middle of merging partitions.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player and DVD app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I just bought a new laptop that comes with Window 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very strange I kept trying to play Local DVDs on external DVD drive connected to Windows Media player...but somehow cant find the options to do so. How?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I intend to play other region DVDs but may not want to purchase Cyberlink PowerDVD due to cost......does the Window 10 DVD app play all regions of DVD and does it come with FHD resolution and high music quality?
</p>
<p>The free Movies and Music apps are sooooo amazing it blew me off!!! Cheers!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to run a DVD using Windows Media Player, you have to set the Windows Media Player as the Default program from the Default Programs section. Go to Cortana Search and type 'Default Programs.' Choose 'Default Program.'</p>
<p>Set Windows Media Player from the Left Pane as the Default program and apply changes. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for your other questions, what do you mean when you say "all regions DVD?"</p>

            Please pay no attention to the Microsoft Support Engineers.&nbsp; They are not direct Microsoft employees.&nbsp; They are contractors who are here to create the illusion of actual MS participation, and they are wrong more often than not.&nbsp; Windows 10 has no native
 ability to play DVD video.&nbsp; The Windows DVD Player app is not very good.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have VLC already, and if you want more advanced functionality you'll have to pay for it.

<h2>            Has anyone successfully registered a docking station&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a docking station recently and cannot register it.<br />
<br />
Serial number is 13 characters and website refuses to accept it.<br />
<br />
Talking with customer support via chat today made me think they were able to register it, but that serial number does not show up on my account.<br />
<br />
I have already submitted an issue needing clarification about the docking station on this forum, and am trying to ensure it is registered.<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
Thanks<br />

            i also wasn't able to register my docking ,i called up MS and they advised me that this is ok since the only device needed to be registered is your surface device ,all connected accessories will be automatically connected to it even if you don't register
 them,,use your surface serial number to communicate issues of your docking with MS.

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing&#47;Crashing Errors and Missing Partition after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing&#47;Crashing Errors and Missing Partition after Installing Anniversary Update &#40;Also missing Windows Store app&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so this seems like a very common issue that a large amount of the community is suffering with, but I'm getting sick of waiting for a response from Microsoft. It's been almost a month since the this update was released, and still no fixes. So for anyone
 wondering, here are the main problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Missing partition (D:\ drive in my case, which contains my profile and all of my files, while my C:\ drive contains the OS and system files).</p>
<p>-Constant freezing, and occasional crashing when opening any program, ESPECIALLY Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>-Computer is extremely, and unbearably slow. Only Microsoft Edge seems to work fine for me.</p>
<p>-For me, Windows Store app has disappeared and cannot be re-installed or updated. I get constant notifications about this.</p>
<p>-If you have the missing partition problem, and your&nbsp;user data is located on that drive,&nbsp;then your Desktop will also&nbsp;disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here are a list of things that I personally have tried that DO NOT work for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Reverting back to a previous build (since it is&nbsp;past the 10 days in which you can revert back, this is no longer an option).</p>
<p>-Opening CMD as admin and typing "sfc /scannow". System detects no errors.</p>
<p>-Entering safe mode (with or without networking). I still experience the same issues.</p>
<p>-System restore. As there has been a few patches released in the past few weeks, restoring the system before the 2nd of August is physically impossible.</p>
<p>-Automatic repair. I get an error saying that my problem could not be fixed, linking me to a log file. Problems still persist.</p>
<p>-Resetting your PC. For people like me, that is not an option.</p>
<p>-Reverting back to Windows 8.1. This is not an option as several of my newer programs are exclusive to Windows 10.</p>
<p>-Any other fixes that Microsoft or anyone in the community have suggested so far have not worked for me, and most others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ADDITIONAL NOTE: When my D:\ partition does disappear, my computer no longer freezes or crashes. So the problem is linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC specs:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 32 GB</p>
<p>PC model: Dell XPS 8700</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, figure out this bug as soon as possible. I have a lot of important work to do on my computer, and my computer has been in non-working condition for 3 weeks. This is getting very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>**UPDATE**</p>
<p>I just realized that Microsoft acknowledged these problems recently, and they are working on a patch.</p>

            <p>Are you familiar with running Diskpart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try opening an Administrative Command prompt and using Diskpart to get information on D.&nbsp; It may be a situation where the partition type has been changed and you could
<em>possibly</em> change it back.&nbsp; Just don't do anything yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into a situation when using EaseUS on a UEFI system where it would turn all the Recovery partitions into OEM partitions and they would show as RAW.&nbsp; All it took then was to return the Type back to the normal version.</p>

            <p>No luck. My D:\ is still missing. However, now I receive an error message whenever I restart my computer that says "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive D:". This message pops up constantly, and I keep having to click "continue"
 until it stops. It also appears when I open any program.</p>

            My D:\ drive doesn't show up at all. It says I have 1 drive with 228 GB and 4 other drives that contain 0 bytes. I should have one with near 3 TB.

            <p>In many systems, the D drive is assigned to an optical drive.&nbsp; That message is consistent with that relationship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you get us a picture of your Disk Management window showing the graphical representation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever get to run Diskpart and check the partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your profile is on a D drive, did you move it using the Windows tools?&nbsp; Could another profile have been created and the two are in conflict?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you notice the post about the problem from Microsoft it mentions "from some users" which may not be encouraging.</p>

            <p>This was my first time using Diskpart; I had to look for some commands online and figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not moved or copied any of my user data or my profile, everything should still be on my D drive. On my C drive there are no profiles&nbsp;in the 'users' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This exact problem has been report quite a bit since the Anniversary Update was released, and Microsoft has said that they are working on a patch for the problem, so that indicates that it is indeed a bug, and that it can be fixed. How long that will take

<p>
</p><p>And it will NOT allow me to update, reinstall, fix or anything to help. The computer is dead to me, I would like full compensation of my computer, my time and my patience. Either reinstall and earlier program from XP or Win 7, or give the instructions to
 erase my hard drive so I can put windows 98 back on my computer, since it is the only program that actually worked since windows 3.1. You would think with all these overly educated PHd's and masters from college with degrees would actually make something that
 works. If I ever installed a faulty piping or gas system in a computer company *(which I have) I would be fired and my company fined. But, since it is Microsoft, then they can do whatever and nobody gets blamed, fired or I am not compensated monetarily. Just
 fix it. please......</p>

            <p>You are showing 5 disk drives, not 5 partitions.&nbsp; If you open Disk Management (Diskmgmt.msc or right click Windows button) there may be an option to put the drives online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the attachment is incorrect and the partitions are not on separate physical drives then maybe we are starting to run down the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be careful of the sounds, it may be related to an overheating processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I have not moved or copied any of my user data or my profile,"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had not moved your profile it would not be in a partition other than the OS partition.&nbsp; But again, D is normally set to the optical drive.&nbsp; If you have the option in Disk Management you might try to set the optical drive to a drive letter like N or
 M to see if it makes a difference.</p>

            <p>Ok I misunderstood you. I did copy my user data to my optical drive about 2 years ago. I thought you were asking if I copied it back to my C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the sounds, I'm not currently doing anything, the sounds started up when I restarted my computer and stopped after about an hour. I had my monitor off most of that time, and had no programs open, so nothing should have been overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try your suggestions and see if anything happens.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer opens slow</h2>
                    <p>This was few months ago, don't mind the text in the video, this was from another issue.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-NN5Y5Jeqk<br />
And this is now:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4w2gxpbdUA</p>
<p>You definitely can see the difference, the os is installed on a 250gb Samsung SSD. Sometimes I don't understand windows 10...<br />
Why all of a sudden it is slow to open, what could have caused this?<br />
It's the same issue with documents, this pc shortcuts on desktop.</p>
<p>I did a clean install of windows and the problem remained the same.</p>
<p>Windows version is 1511(10586.873)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>File explorer is a core file of Windows and does a lot more behind the scene. If the issue persists after performing a clean install, we suggest that you disable Quick Access in File Explorer as most users reported that doing this resolves the issue for
 them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you open a File Explorer window, you’ll see the Quick Access view, which provides access to frequently used folders and recently used files. To see the This PC view instead, click the
<strong>File </strong>menu, and select <strong>Change folder and search options</strong>. Click the
<strong>Open File Explorer to</strong> box at the top of the window, select <strong>
This PC</strong> instead of <strong>Quick access</strong>, then click on <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>In this case, you might find the following suggestions helpful:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Rebuild your search index. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>control.exe srchadmin.dll</strong>, and click on
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Advanced </strong>button.</li><li>From the <strong>Advanced </strong>dialogue box, select <strong>Rebuild</strong>. Selecting
<strong>Rebuild</strong> will begin the process of deleting, and then rebuilding your PC’s search index.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While the steps to initiate the rebuilding process are simple, the actual process can take quite some time depending on how much data Windows has to index.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Create&nbsp; a File </strong><strong>Explorer</strong> <strong>shortcut on your desktop.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your Windows 10 desktop, right-click with the mouse.</li><li>Select <strong>New </strong>&gt; <strong>Shortcut</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>explorer.exe</strong> in the <strong>Location </strong>box.</li><li>Click on <strong>Next </strong>button.</li><li>Click on <strong>Finish </strong>button. You should now have a shortcut on your desktop.</li><li>Right-click the new shortcut, and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Target line</strong>, change it to <em>(note the space between <strong>
C:\Windows\explorer.exe </strong>and <strong>/n</strong>)</em>:<br />
<strong>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /n</strong></li><li>Click the <strong>OK </strong>button. Now you can double-click it like your regular File Explorer app.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Reset the File Explorer view to the default settings across all your folders.</strong></p>
<p>

    <title>Lock Screen Image Location &#8211; On the PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davemckeen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock Screen Image Location &#8211; On the PC</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing Windows 10 Pro (OEM) on a new PC build last June I selected one of my own photos to edit and use as
 my Lock Screen.<span>&nbsp; </span>It looks great, but I would like to edit it further.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can’t find it!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>HELP!!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can see it in Settings &gt; Personalize &gt; Lock Screen but can’t get it to give up its secret location.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I hover over it nothing happens.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I right click on it, the thumbnail jiggles a little but doesn’t reveal any information – not even a file name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m not talking about “C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData\S-1-5-21-1561468695-878025909-126061477-1001\ReadOnly\LockScreen_A”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That’s where Windows puts the “in use” image.<span>&nbsp; </span>I should have put mine in with the defaults at “C:\Windows\Web\Screen” but didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any hints?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if I give up and put the properly edited one in with the defaults, how can I zap the thumbnail in Personalize of
 the one I can’t find?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks - Dave</span></p>

            Hi Dave
<br />
<br />you should locate those image(s) in this location in File Explroer - make sure to temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items' and 'File Name Extensions' on the View Ribbon
<br />
<br />(Replace UserName with your login name)
<br />
<br />C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets
<br />
<br />In that folder, you will find files with long file names, copy them out to another folder and add a .jpg file extension to each one, so you can view them . .

<p>Hi Greg and DaveM121,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for the responses.&nbsp; I think what I'm looking for is right under my nose.&nbsp; Just after installing Windows, when I wanted to use a custom lock screen picture I clicked on Browse under the default thumbs and navigated to
<em>the original</em> of the picture I wanted to use.&nbsp; When I posted to start this thread some 2 and a half months later I was convinced I had edited the photo and placed it in some dedicated place for screen pictures.&nbsp; But it looks like I never did.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I will do is to do the editing I want then place the fixed-up picture in with the defaults.&nbsp; Then I'll know later!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was bugging me (the real question) was that I could not get any info out of the thumbs in Personalize that would lead me to the 'mother' files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all has been helpful though.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Dave</p>

            Hello,<br />

<br />
Just download and run, rest it will manage automatically.<br />
<br />
In case, above fails, then try creating another account and check whether the issue still persists.<br />
<br />

            Using a HP Elitepad with Windows 8. I can access the Store, download and use free or trial apps but when I try to purchase an app and click the confirm button it will not complete the transaction. It stays on the processing payment, enter Microsoft password
 screen until I cancel. I disconnected my Microsoft id and tried again and it just stays on the enter password screen.&nbsp; It indicates it is processing but it never completes. I've run the troubleshooters, checked location and the other advice given. Anything
 else?

    <title>EDITED and SAVED Upload Clips from a MONTH ago all the way back to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lochmere  say:</h3>
<h2>            EDITED and SAVED Upload Clips from a MONTH ago all the way back to ALMOST LAUNCH DAY GONE&#33; &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>Never had to post here before, rarely had issues with my 360 or my One that couldn't be solved by google or troubleshooting, but I could only find one other person with this issue, and it was a reddit post with no replies.</p>
<p>I've had my Xbox One since the December after launch, never had any real issues with it, occasional mic breaking and I had to send my Kinect in once to get repaired. This however is very heartbreaking for me, as I discovered when I went to Upload today,
 that all but my last 42 'captures' were GONE. Yes, they were EDITED, yes they were SAVED, all were NAMED as well, all things that keep the clips from being deleted automatically according to Upload and Xbox Live. I had a lot of clips, over 150 saved and edited,
 might have been even closer to 200, was at 95% Upload hard drive capacity last time I checked. That being said, even the edited clips I had from the day I got my Xbox were still there as of two weeks ago, even with all the unsaved auto recorded clips from
 Battlefield, Magic, and Madden being recorded constantly. At one point at I had 175 saved and edited clips and over a 100 auto recorded unsaved clips, and still nothing was auto deleted or vanished.</p>
<p>Yet, I was heartbroken to see all of them GONE when accessing Upload today, not a single edited named clip remaining, only 42 unsaved ones. I know they were there as of 03/10/15, as I had recorded a GTA V heist clip and edited it that day, still had all
 my edited and saved clips, was at 95% space used for Upload. What is even more strange is that the edited version of that GTA clip is gone, but the unedited version is still there amongst the 42 clips.</p>
<p>Not all were uploaded to OneDrive sadly (I had issues with this during the first few months of Xbox one, so I only recently started uploading to OneDrive within the last 6 months). The only reason I had gotten on upload today was to start backing up more
 of them to OneDrive in order to make room for new stuff...well there is room now, although it is terrible that it happened this way. The 14 clips that I did upload to OneDrive are still there, meaning I'm not crazy and I did actually have clips edited and
 saved, but on the console, Upload says I have no clips saved or edited, just those 42 unedited clips. One other curious note, I had a friend on his account check my clips to see what he could see, he can't even get to my clips, and when checking on smart glass,
 it says I have none, not even the 42 unedited clips.</p>
<p>Lesson learned I guess, but I don't understand how this could have happened. There was no warning, it never happened before, and there was seemingly no reason for it to occur. The only possible explanation is too many unsaved clips caused Upload to auto
 delete, but after they added the ability to do multiple clip selection and deletion, I was pretty good about deleting all those auto clips to keep it from cluttering up. Not to mention, Upload is only suppose to auto delete unsaved, unedited clips, not saved
 and edited ones, according to the Help snap in the app. The only other thing that has changed since 03/10/15, is that Upload seemed to have gotten an update; when you go to access your clips, it now says My Captures, not My Clips (it still said My Clips on
 03/10/15). This update may have caused my edited and saved clips to vanish, either by weird glitch or cloud disconnect.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this issue? Given the lack of topics or posts elsewhere of this subject, it seems unlikely, but I would advise everyone check their Upload clips just in case!!! I really hope there is a fix for this, or that it is a cloud saving issue
 when Microsoft updated Upload, and that they will reappear at some point. I'm never going to stop being an Xbox gamer, love the console, the service, and games, but this is the first issue I've had where I am really saddened and disappointed with something
 on Xbox Live. There are a lot of memories in those clips, for me and my friends who are in them, and I would really love to have them back so I can back them up properly. Hope to hear back from somebody soon, and really hope that my saved and edited clips
 are just tucked away in the cloud somewhere.</p>

            <p>Hey there, Lochmere! I'm incredibly sorry to see that the clips seem to have vanished for you! I do hope that I can at least ease your mind in this situation.</p>
<p>While it might be a weird issue, your game clips are not gone. They may not be on your console, but I can see them on <a href="https://account.xbox.com/gameclips?gamertag=lochmere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">your profile</a> on the website all the way back to 12/28/2013. So you can at least see them there!</p>
<p>I believe you may be right in that with the amount of unsaved clips you have, the system might have removed some to make more room. The update you saw was for Upload 2.0, and this may also be why your clips are gone. Counting on the profile page I linked above back to the day the update was released, it seems that your last 42 clips are all from when that update went live. Upload might have removed all the clips from before because they were for the original Upload app.</p>
<p>My main suggestion in this case is to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove your profile</a> and then <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/sign-in-to-another-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">add it again to your console</a>. If that doesn't work for you, you can at least have the solace that everything is still saved here on the server and your profile at xbox.com. :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would want to know if I delete all my saved clips and screenshots from the Upload app in the console, are all of them deleted from my profile also? Or are they all still "in the cloud"? Should I upload all clips/screenshots to OneDrive before deleting
 them from Upload? Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's likely that your default application for opening photos is <strong>Paint</strong>. To change your default program in Windows 10 from
<strong>Paint </strong>to the <strong>Photo </strong><strong>app</strong>, we suggest that you perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>On the </span><strong>Start</strong> <span>&nbsp;menu, select </span><strong>Settings</strong><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Go to<strong> System</strong></span><span>, then go to </span><strong>Default apps</strong><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Select <strong>Photos </strong>or any app that you like to be the default under
<strong>Photo viewer</strong>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us if the steps above helped you in resolving your concern.</p>

<p>I did as you suggested and there was no option to set the default for photos viewer for photos. &nbsp;The only option it gave to select was PAINT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to "set default by app" and changed those to use photos instead of paint. &nbsp;After changing those and these restarting my computer I then got the option to set the default for photo view to photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took quite a bit of time to change all of these apps one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the only way I found to change the Photo Viewer Default to Photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be an easier method.</p>

<h3> somebody500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Connection Constantly Dropping Out</h2>
                    When trying to use my University Wi-Fi, my wireless connection keeps changing to "No Internet Access."&nbsp; I keep having to go through the struggle everytime this happens, where I have to end up resetting my wireless adapter.&nbsp; I'm not sure what is causing
 this; I have filed a ticket with my university IT department, but it happens, nowhere near as frequently, but still tends to happen on other networks too.

<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection.
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>1) Try moving to another area of the University and see if the situation improves.</span><br />
<span>2) Go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, select your adapter&gt; Properties&gt; Energy Saver tab, deselect or disable this option.</span><br />
<span>If you do not solve, go to the advanced settings of the network card, look for the item Wireless Mode, set to 802.11b / g</span><br />
<span>Note: adopt this setting only when you are in the university area.</span>

<h2>            Commandos 2 Men of Courage.</h2>
                    Aswell as it being a PC game it was also released on the original XBOX, for those that don't know about it please google it before posting, for those of you who have played it, what did you think of it?<br />
<br />
And to all posters in this thread, would you buy the game if it was released on XBLA?<br />
<br />
I personally love the game, and am amazed we have not seen it on the XBOX 360, and would gladly hand over some money for an XBLA or even a retail release of the game.

<p>I really liked the game on the previous Xbox, still got a few copies tucked away in the retro cupboard. I certainly have a purchase if it came onto Live!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Actually, there are loads of old Xbox games that I'd like them to bring over but it seems to be the same case as PSN. There are so many classic PS1 games that never make it to PSN and it's quite sad to be honest as most of these old games are being lost
 to time! </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Where's mercenaries on Live?</p>
<p>Where is Little big adventure, or Discworld on PSN?</p>

<p>Its's deeply saddening that most old classics will never make it...</p>

                    <p>The Realtek ALC889 sound stops working in Windows 8 RTM after resuming from S1&nbsp;sleep mode, I need to disconnect and reconnect the audio cable in order to restore the sound and I have to do this every time the computer sleeps.&nbsp; I'm using the latest Realtek
 R2.70 audio driver.&nbsp; I tried the audio troubleshooter and it could not find any problems and there is nothing to fix.&nbsp; The only way to fix the sound is to physically unplug the audio cable and then plug it back in and I have to do this every time I resume
 from sleep and this could wear out the speaker or headphone jack from repeatedly unplugging and replugging the cable.</p>

<p>Can you save a file on the external drive?</p>

            <p>Try going to that directory in File Explorer and then delete the file.&nbsp; Or else delete everything that Windows will allow you to delete in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.&nbsp; All that stuff in the Temp directory is supposed to be temporary, but some programs
 (including Microsoft's) do not remove the stuff they put in there, so you can delete whatever is in there, and if Windows is using it, it will tell you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile that setup program could either be something previously installed on your machine that may no longer work in Windows 10, or else it could be some form of malware trying to get itself installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can check the website for the computer for updated
 software (drivers and such) compatible&nbsp;with Windows 10 for the former, and for the malware, get
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.malwarebytes.org</a> which is free.</p>

    <title>Can I install windows 8 onto a pc that has no operating system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronjambo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install windows 8 onto a pc that has no operating system currently installed on it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hello<br />
Can I install windows 8 onto a pc that has no operating system currently installed on it?</p>
<p>also..<br />
I'm running windows 8 release preview on this pc&nbsp;how can&nbsp;I upgrade to windows 8 or pro for this pc?<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;think that I am&nbsp;probably not&nbsp;the only one who is confused be this....</p>
<p>almost everything I can find about windows 8 says that I must have xp vista or 7 installed to be able to get 8<br />
it says that if I want to upgrade to 8 from xp vista or 7 via download then the cost is £25
<br />
but if I want to buy a disk and have it shipped to me the cost is £50<br />
which also says I must have an older version of windows installed<br />
well...<br />
I am thinking about buying a new pc from ebuyer that does not have an operating system on it<br />
so I will need to buy&nbsp;an operating system (or install Linux/Ubuntu)&nbsp;<br />
and this all makes it look like&nbsp;I should buy a copy of windows 7 and a copy of windows 8 is that correct?<br />
<br />
If I buy the windows 8 on a disk do I really need to have an older version of windows for it to work?<br />
Or does it install windows 8 for me like any other version of windows?<br />
<br />
there is no options to buy windows 7 from the Microsoft store that I can find, so please will someone make this clear to me...<br />
If I can just buy windows 8 and install it onto any pc then I will probably buy it.<br />
If I need an older version of windows then I probably will not buy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am currently running the release preview for windows 8 which is no longer being updated it seems<br />
If I buy windows 8 can I just run the installer and put it onto this pc over the release preview?<br />
<br />
and I know that I will need 2 copy's of windows 8 if I am going to run it on 2 pc's.<br />
<br />
thanks for your help.<br />
<br />

            <p>In order to install Windows 8 Pro upgrade, you will first need to reinstall your original version of Windows that was running on your computer prior to installing the Windows 8 Release Preview. Whether that is (Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7). After installing
 it, you can then do an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. The Windows 8 Release Preview does not support upgrades to Windows 8 Pro.

<br />
my 1st and main question is can I install windows 8 OR pro onto a pc that has NO operating system<br />
</p>
<p>is&nbsp;the answer to this<br />
no there is not a full version of windows 8 and you must buy an older version of windows 1st<br />
<br />
please don't spam me with a copy paste reply <br />
please give me a real&nbsp;answer<br />
</p>
<p>I know the windows upgrade versions are to upgrade from older versions</p>

            <p>First, watch the attitude because if you didn't notice, your question was ignored and I took the time to answer it.</p>
<span>
<p>There are no full retail versions of Windows 8. If you need a full version, you will need to purchase the Windows 8 Pro OEM from New Egg. This requires a custom clean install.</p>

            <p>I have the same question as the OP, and your 'watch the attitude' response is frankly rude. You didn't answer his question, because he explicitly stated that he does not have Windows already on the PC he wishes to buy 8 for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've tried searching on the Microsoft website for information about how to install Windows 8 on a computer with no Microsoft operating system already installed, or for any way of contacing MS directly to ask this, you would understand our frustration.
 According to the MS website, you can either upgrade from XP/Vista, or buy a new copy if you're running 7. So if you bought a PC without OS, or you're running an older version of Windows than XP... you don't exist.</p>

            <p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>I am currently on a pc that doesn't have an operating system installed on it. I bought it two years ago and would like to be able to install one but it doesn't have a tower as it's one of those all in one computers. It doesn't have a dvd/cd player in it.
</p>
<p>Is there a way of doing this?</p>
<p>Also my current computer is needing to be fixed that does have an operating system on it. IT has windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>
Can somebody please help me out here?<br />

<h2>            Notification Issues with Skype on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</h2>
                    <p>I'm not receiving Skype message notifications on my Android Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. &nbsp;It was working fine up until a few days ago. &nbsp;I have already checked/tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made sure my app is updated</p>
<p>I'm signed into Skype</p>
<p>My Skype settings are set to allow notifications</p>
<p>My Samsung settings on Apps is set to allow notifications</p>
<p>I've re-set Skype to the factory settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've turned the phone on and off again!</p>
<p>I can't see any conversations which have been stopped from allowing notifications</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a problem with the Skype app? Any help to solve this problem is appreciated as it's really frustrating.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's not receiving messages that I have a problem with it's receiving a notification / alert when I do receive a message or call. &nbsp;It was working fine up until I installed an update on the app. &nbsp;Researching online I can see that other people are experiencing
 the same problem so there is clearly a problem with the app.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem. My notifications on my S7 Edge were working fine Sunday morning and then just stopped working and have not worked since. No light, no sound, no notifications! And it just stopped working in an instant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have followed all the suggestions offered with no luck. &nbsp;The app becomes useless if you are not notified of receved messages in real time. Its frustrating to have to check your phone often, and then to miss an important conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to the multiple threads discussing this issue.</p>

<p>I have the nearly the same notification problem on my Huawei P8 Lite. But my smartphone notifies me with sound but without LED-Lightning. The LED notification is enabled and the LED works fine in other apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the last skype update, the LED didnt flash blue at incoming messages. (Only if I use other free LED-manager apps, the LED lights up again at Skype messages).</p>

<h2>            I want to migrate my Windows 10 to a new hardrive</h2>
                    My current setup up is a 128GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, both internal. The installation drive is the 128GB SSD and it is full. I've taken everything I can off of it and it still full. I want to replace it with a 512GB SSD, but of course, want to keep my windows
 10 licence. Is there an easy/quick/streamlined way to do this and if not is it even&nbsp;possible to do it without breaking some obscure terms and conditions thing?

            Hi Scott.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Swap out the SSD, remove any other hard drives, boot the WIndows 10 media provided to do the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to transfer the install you have because it's already a great install then use free Macrium which will allow you to easily transfer only used part of C and then once it's applied to the new SSD, choose Drive Tools link that opens up above it in the app to size it out to the full SSD or only as large as you want C to be.  
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember that it is only files that do not benefit from the SSD speed so can be moved off of it if space ever gets tight.
<br />
<br />You'll have no problem reactivating with only an SSD change.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Scott, you have 2 options - neither will break any Microsoft Terms and Conditions!
<br />
<br />Use a 3rd party software to clone the 128GB SSD onto the 512GB SSD. In truth this does cause complications in a lot of cases. it causes system failures, driver problems and sometimes it is hard to get back the rest of the 512GB SSD
<br />
<br />
<br />Your best option by far is a clean install of Windows 10 onto the 512GB SSD
<br />
<br />This method is a lot more work, but will result in a more stable and resilient system!
<br />
<br />Backup you files from the 128GB SSD to the 1TB HDD
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Remove the SSD and the HDD from your System
<br />
<br />Connect the new SSD to the same SATA port on your Motherboard
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />Begin the installation . . .
<br />
<br />During the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point - only remove the installation Media when you reach the Desktop
<br />
<br />Once Windows is installed, load any required drivers and put it on the Internet so it Activates from the Microsoft Servers
<br />
<br />Finally, shut your PC down, reconnect the 1TB HDD and start your system again
<br />
<br />Yes, this method will take time, but you will end up with a stable and responsive system !

    <title>Cannot connect to mobile hotspot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jos62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to mobile hotspot</h2>
                    <p>I can succesfully setup my old Dell Windows 10 laptop (build in wifi adapter) as a mobile hotspot and I can connect to it with my iPad, iPhone and Chromebook. However when I try to connect my Windows 10 desktop to the mobile hotspot I can select the wireless
 network I defined, I can type in the password I defined and the desktop tries to connect..... After 10 seconds the systems returns the message "cannot connect to the network".&nbsp;<br />
It looks like everything is OK on the Dell laptop (apple things connect).<br />
I can't figure out what's wrong on the desktop.<br />
The desktop can connect to normal wifi networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I use a Linksys AE3000 adapter on the desktop.</p>
<p />

            Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options
<br />    Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")
<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've done everything you wrote and it worked exactly as you wrote it, but unfortunately my desktop still says "cannot connect to this network". My iPad and Chromebook still connect great to the laptop hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another WiFi adapter so I can't check if it is an adapter issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get any new ideas.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Sint Maarten and after the hurricane Irma it's difficult to get a new Internet subscription, so i have to make use of a connection one block away. My laptop serves as a hotspot to that block.</p>
<p>I would be very greatful if it could work.</p>
<p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is installed?
<br />
<br />You could try another option called Virtual Router Manager.
<br />
<br />See how to download it and set it up:

<div>I have a question regarding sharing files <i>from </i>my surface. I seek to access documents that I have created on my tablet from my home computer. How can I do this with the minimum of hassle (ie not using a memory stick or the like)?</div>

<div>Homegroup seems to work well in transferring files from my laptop to my tablet, but not the other way around...</div>

<h2>            Remote Desktop error &#34;http Endpoint Exception&#58;4, the non-proxy http connection failed to connect with the message&#58; 501 not implemented&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to control a Windows 10 PC from a Mac. &nbsp;I have installed Microsoft Remote Desktop on Mac OSX. &nbsp;I can successfully connect to the PC and control it from within my home network, but when I try to control it over the internet I receive the above
 error message (in the subject line). &nbsp;My network configuration is simple. &nbsp;I have a wireless router whose address is 10.0.0.1, and the ip address of the PC I am trying to control is 10.0.0.69. &nbsp;I have determined my public ip address and entered that in the
 "PC name" field of &nbsp;the Remote Desktop dialog.</p>
<p>I have followed directions to port forward port 3389 to ip address 10.0.0.69 in my router. &nbsp;Is this correct?</p>
<p>Also, I am confused about the need for a "gateway" in the setup of RDP on the mac. In the gateway setup, I specified that the Server name is 10.0.0.69. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;Should I need to have a gateway configured? &nbsp;If I leave Gateway unconfigured, I receive
 a different error, namely "Unable to connect to remote PC. &nbsp;Please verify Remote Desktop is enabled...."</p>
<p>Can anyone help?<br />
