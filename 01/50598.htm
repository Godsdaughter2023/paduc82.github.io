<h2>            My Xbox One X used to connect to a hotspot but now it can&#39;t.</h2>
                    <p>So here is our situation,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm a leader at a Cub Scout Group and we don't have a internet connection in the building, we sometimes treat the Cubs and have a Xbox night with 4 consoles or when we have sleepovers we use 1 console to watch one of the many movies I have on my
 account. (p.s there needs to be a download movie to console option on Xbox like the PC app has.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used my Samsung Note 8 and my Acer Switch Tablet to setup Hotspots in the building with very little issues. The Samsung is the better hotspot with better grade Wi-Fi so we hooked up 3 consoles to it and 1 to the Acer Switch and played Sea of
 Thieves last November with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night we had a Sleepover and I needed the Hotspot to watch the new Wreck it Ralph movie I bought on the marketplace but no matter how I tried I couldn't get the Xbox to connect. I've tried resetting everything at least twice with no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I had to drive to the local supermarket and buy the Blu Ray because we ran out of time. This morning I've been trying again and still nothing. so to test to see if it was the Xbox or my hotspots I got both of our other Leaders to try and connect
 to the hotspots with their phones and it worked perfectly. The issue seems to be the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue, does anyone have any suggestion or fixes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

<p>Hey there Mike!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues trying to connect. </p>
<p>Generally, our support doesn't recommend connecting through hot-spot connection as it's harder to change their settings or troubleshoot. However seeing as it worked at one point, I would say that you try the steps outlined in our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Connection and Network Solution</a>&nbsp;to see if that helps. Otherwise, you might need to get in contact with your hotspot provider and see if there's any means set up the hotspot to the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network settings on Xbox One</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, review those support articles and let us know if the steps there helped out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>            WMP 12 ratings</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 7, WMP 12.0.7601.17514</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is functioning correctly, except that for some reason when I rate something as 4 stars it changes to 5. In Windows Explorer I can see the rating column clearly showing 4 stars - and I can rate the tracks correctly from there too, but it is always
 treated as 5 stars in WMP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I store all my music on an external drive, and have the option to "maintain my star ratings as global ratings in files" ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was never a problem on previous versions. Is there anything I can do to resolve this?

            Thanks but I did that and it says I'm using the most recent version. Probably as I'm on Windows 7 and I guess the current version is for Windows 8 onwards only?<br />

            No - that's Windows 7...are all your other Windows Updates in place? Where did you get the number of your current version from (it may be that which is incorrect...)?<br />

<p>
</p><p>But just checked and there are quite a few listed. Though nothing that appears to relate specifically to WMP. Still, it's worth running all the updates I suppose.

            If all other updates seem to be OK - have you updated IE too? Even if you don't use it it should be updated because it has a bearing on other Windows items. In the meantime I'll check my update history and try and find the one relevant to the WMP update
 (which was about last July as I recall)<br />

            <p>Well I've been digging too and I looked at the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
MS 'which version of WMP should I have</span>?' page... <strong>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/190990?wa=wsignin1.0</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; - and that still shows the number you mentioned as being current! So it may be that my system differs from yours in some way (W7 Home Premium 64 bit) - pc is a Dell Inspiron laptop. I picked this up because on checking my friends HP W7 laptop, he had yet
 a different wmp version number! So apparently there are variables.</p>
<p>It looks like the relevant Windows Update to my version change may have been KB3001554<br />
More information: <strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3001554</strong> which came in on 1st October last year. It gets us no nearer determining why your star ratings are at odds however...</p>
<p>Work through what we have so far and then it might be worth running a few other checks. R</p>

            <p>Thanks for that - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked about that update and it pertains to DVD playback, so I'm not sure if it will help here. But I found that KB update in my list of optional updates, installed and restarted the PC. Version number is still the same, and the ratings bug still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for digging through like that though, but it seems that this may be a red herring. I've been searching around for anyone with similar issues online and found nothing. Usually when that happens I'm inclined to think it's something to do with my system
 set up. May rebuild the library if I can't get anywhere.</p>

            <p>I have a user who also has exactly this problem.&nbsp; She also followed the change password steps, per link in MS Engineer's response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System will not allow login under either the old password OR the new one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Managed to get her into the Advanced startup menu.&nbsp; System restore - won't work without a valid password.&nbsp; System Recovery - won't work without a valid password.&nbsp; Safe mode - won't work without a valid password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She can't even roll back to Windows 8.1 because you have to be able to log into Windows desktop to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that there seem to be a number of people with this issue - not only on this support board, but also on other forums, I think it would be appropriate for MS to address it, with a solution rather than a scripted response.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did post a thread myself about this because I wasn't able to find one yesterday.&nbsp; That was after I had waited 20 mins hoping to use the chat function, because it didn't inform me that the function was closed - just persistently gave me the "please wait"
 option, as though the helpdesk was open.&nbsp; I then tried to arrange a call back for her and after trying to find any slot in the next TEN days, I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is obviously more to this than people simply forgetting their passwords - and it's not the first time a bug of this nature has shown up either - it happened with build 10041</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lady now has no access to the internet apart from what she can get on her phone, so she has no facility to download and burn Window 8.1 for a re-install.</p>

            <p>I upgraded my win7 machine and after the update I am not able to login to the local account. I waited for 2 days for MS to call me back. I instead installed another SSD and installed a fresh copy of win7 and office 10 so I can work. I got the update offer
 on my NEW install and guess what??</p>
<p>It is now stuck in an endless loop of "Welcome back !&nbsp; enter your password".</p>

<p>Unfortunately no; haven't been able to use my laptop for two weeks now. I shift-restarted it and re-installed Windows 10; guess what: log in, password prompt, again my microsoft account password is INCORRECT and the shutdown/restart button (should be at

<h3> yvonnelt  say:</h3>
<h2>            error 1606 could not access network location &#37;appdata&#37;</h2>
                    I too receive the message when trying to install updates like Adobe 9 and products like windows installer cleaner.&nbsp; Looking at kb886549 I am nervous about following the list provided for windows vista as it does not appear logical to me.&nbsp; It says Personal
 should read ....\PrintHood and PrintHood should read ...\Documents.&nbsp; My registry currently shows personal as ....documents and printhood as ...\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Printer Shortcuts.......these seem to be more logical to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently
 left with no Adobe and therefore cannot access any PDF files anywhere.<br />
I too have recentlyt updated to Explorer 8.&nbsp; Are we sure the list for Windows Vista is correct?&nbsp; also the list of Applies To only includes programs which I do not have.&nbsp; I am running vista home premium service pack 1, office home and student 2007 (which works
 correctly) and explorer 8.&nbsp; I have windows live one care as my system security.<br />
<br />
Additonal question relates to para 8. in kb886549.&nbsp; Does this para apply to Vista?&nbsp; The value data shows %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\.....; in my registry the value data for some says %PUBLIC%\..... and for others %Program Data%\......&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I really want to be sure of the information before amending registry values as I do not want to create a terminal problem for my computer.<br />
<br />
Appreciate help.

            Hello Joseph and others<br />
<br />
I did in the end get my technician to look at my computer as I my regisgtry settings were so different to those in KB886549.&nbsp; He thoroughly checked out my system and the problem was with the AppsData registry which he fixed for me.&nbsp; Took him about 1 1/2 hours
 and I would say money well spent.&nbsp; My computer is now working fine and I have easily installed Adobe andd &nbsp;itunes updates.&nbsp; My registry settings still look quite different to those in KB886549 so my initial question still goes unanswered.&nbsp; Are we sure the
 settings shown in KB88659 are accurate/correct for all versions of Vista??<br />
<br />
But again Joseph and MS I do think your Answers Forum is fabulous......<br />

            <p>Hello Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated, but that's not it.</p>
<p>It's not a connection problem per se -&nbsp;I can&nbsp;connect to both wired and wireless connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find perplexing is that it requires four clicks to connect to a known and trusted wired connection.</p>
<p>I have Linux Mint running on another machine and it connects automatically without any clicking, so I am assuming there is a way in W10 to have it connect just as swiftly without any additional input - I just can't seem to see it.</p>
<p>Is there a way of giving a particular connection a set of preferences so that it auto-connects?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to us with the status of your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time and effort&nbsp;to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>This issue might occur if the 'Automatically detect settings' is not checked in Internet Options.</p>
<p>I suggest you to&nbsp;enable the 'Automatically detect settings' and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>1) Type <strong>Internet Option </strong>in the search area in the task bar and select
<strong>Internet Option</strong>.</p>
<p>2) Click on the <strong>Connection</strong> tab.</p>
<p>3) Click on <strong>LAN settings </strong>at the bottom.</p>
<p>4) Mark Check&nbsp; on <strong>'Automatically detect settings' </strong>option.</p>
<p>5) Restart your computer and see if you still experience this issue.</p>

            <p>Thank you Santosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Automatically detect settings' in the said menu is checked.</p>
<p>I tried enabling the equivalent&nbsp;'Automatically detect settings' in the menu for the desired wired connection, but it broke it because, I think, the specific credentials are not being sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you suggest might work well if I connect through a router (either wired or wireless) and the router already&nbsp;deals with the server.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;on a wired PPPoE outlet though, which requires&nbsp;authentication - but I'm really asking it to do no more than&nbsp;an
 average router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have just set up the connection again, and in the setup process it says there in one of the windows:</p>
<p>"To connect to the internet next time, left-click the network item&nbsp;in the taskbar and click the connection that you have just created" - which is precisely what I'm trying to get around because it's a known and trusted connection with all the credentials
 available.</p>
<p>Seems there is&nbsp;no provision for auto-connect&nbsp;after all?</p>

                    I have used Windows 10 to share photos to an email previously. I have tried going from the PHoto app on both the PC and laptop this time but the emails will not go and just go into OUTbox.&nbsp; I tried opening email and attaching from both Pictures and Photos
 but again it did not send.&nbsp;&nbsp; I even sent the email to the same email I was sending it from and that worked but couldn't forward it or send it anywhere else.

<p>1: no the issue is not specific to a particular Recipient.2: I sent the image from Windows 10 Photos on the share part, it came up asking to set up accounts for Mail and I set this up using my gmail account.</p>
<p>(by the way since doing this I keep getting emails saying"sign in attempt prevented" from Google</p>
<p>3: Mail client, Optusnet, and in the outbox the email is still there, or was until today when they have all been sent.</p>
<p>4: I don't get any error message, only when I go onto Optusnet and it says I have unsent messages.</p>
<p>5: Yes I am able to send emails without an attachment.</p>

    <title>&#34;logon process has failed to create the security option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smatthew6640  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;logon process has failed to create the security option dialog.&#34; X Failure- Security options.  __</h2>
                    
<p>When running Word and now Excel I experience a gray out of the application (not responding)followed by a black screen (cursor still visible) and then after some time a dialog box with the following:</p>
<p>"logon process has failed to create the security option dialog." X Failure- Security options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this process I try to "Ctrl Alt Delete" in order to get to my task list and end the application but without success.&nbsp; It is recurring more and more frequently.<br />
I am on Vista Ultimate and Office 2007. <br />
I am current with McAfee Security Center, but don't think this is a virus or some type of malware.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello smatthew6640,<br />
<br />
Does this only happen with Word or Excel or do you experience this Logon process fail at other times?<br />
I would check the event viewer for system and application logs and see if you can tell when this error occurs and what the faulting application could be.<br />
<br />
Then reply back with more information and we will be glad to help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I also receive this message, however it happens even when doing nothing.&nbsp; once logged in the screen freezes - it can happen straight away or even after 10 minutes. after waiting some time I click Control alt delete, and then after some time the screen goes
 black with this message.&nbsp;&nbsp; the only way I can get started again is to turn off the power.<br />
<br />
This is occuring almost daily.<br />
<br />
I am also Vista and office 2007<br />
<br />
please assist.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            I also have the same experience.&nbsp; Apparently, thousands of others do&nbsp;when I google this problem.&nbsp; It appears to be peculiar to MS Vista so I would hope that there would be an answer directly from Microsoft and/or others.

            I too have this exact problem. However after having shutdown my computer manually, and choosing to restart in 'safe mode' the problem does not seem to occur. This does not give me the option to access the internet though. I read on another website that
 running two anti-virus programs may be a cause??

    <title>Windows 10 gets stuck during shutdown with a blank screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> estragon helmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 gets stuck during shutdown with a blank screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm fairly sure this is a Windows 10 issue as it only started after Windows 10 was installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I shut down my laptop, the shutdown gets stuck. It finishes displaying the shutting down screen, and the screen goes off, but the laptop remains on. The only way I can get it to turn off after that is holding the power button for a force shut
 down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't happen every time I shut down, but I haven't managed to find any pattern as to why/when it does and doesn't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has lights on it, and those always used to remain on for about 5 seconds after the screen turned off, but now they never go off by themselves. The cooling fan also continues to spin after shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some details about my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer: Alienware 17 Laptop</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous OS: Windows 8.1</p>

c. Click "<strong>View all</strong>" and then click "<strong>Power</strong>".<br />
d. Click "<strong>Next</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, then <strong>perform clean boot.</strong><br />

            do an over-install of the current one with the same disk - make sure that you enter the Key during the installation. - i.e. boot the system, then instert the disk, and select an Upgrade install.

            <p>You will have to reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

</p><p>It is unfortunate that this happened. To help you regain access to your account, please fill out the verification form:
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you answering the form, please refer to the tips below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi
 or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred. </li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)
 And also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge.
</li><li>You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.<br />
​</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After answering the form, please expect an email reply within 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You might've provided a different sign in credential which is why your chats, profile pic and contacts are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check this, you can sign out from the Skype app and use the diagnostics link:

            <p>Hi danirobbo85,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query. I understand that you are receiving 0x800CCC0F error. There are 2 possible causes on why you've encountered this error message:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
Incorrect POP3 settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
Firewall is blocking the ports (usually port 25) - Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>As an initial troubleshooting, I suggest that you reconfigure your account by following the steps provided
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>For firewall issue, you can try to disable the security software/firewall to isolate the cause of this issue. Kindly refer to this

<h2>            Unexpected I&#47;O error 0xc00000e9</h2>
                    
<p>I clean installed Windows 7 Professional (full version) 5 days ago and now my system cannot boot (it had been fine previous days with multiple shut down/ restarts).&nbsp;I attempted to start up today and got&nbsp;"Unexpected I/O error has occurred. Status 0xc00000e9"
 and some message about "Windows has encountered a problem communicating with a device connected to your computer" even though I had no USB devices connected at the time. Startup repair is not shown as an option; only continue or escape. When I continue, it
 shows the "Windows is loading" progress bar and it stops around 75% every time. Help!!</p>
<p>I do have the installation files available to reinstall the OS, but am hesitant to do that bcs I am afraid if I do I will lose all my current data..is that correct?? I really don't want to lose everything just to get the computer to work again.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi BeccaB,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error message relates to a hardware error pertaining to your computer's BIOS. Basically it is telling you that the computer
 is not able to reliably communicate with the hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As you have no external device plugged in to your computer, there might be some drivers conflicting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You might need to remove sound card etc.. from BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide
 semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the
 settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            How can I set the default program for a file that currently opens with Windows Command Processor&#63;</h2>
                    I have a data file for a java program that was originally set to windows shell commor. I tried to open it with notepad and that set the default program to notepad. But it always made notepad crash and I wanted it to stop opening with notepad (I wanted
 to open it in eclipse). All the other data files were still set to windows shell commor and opened in eclipse, no problem. So I tried to reset this one that was set to notepad and accidentally set it to open with Windows Command Processor. Now it won't let
 me choose a new default program, not even notepad. I really want to change it to windows shell commor. How can I do this? (The file extension is not a normal one like .txt).

<h2>            Quickbooks Won&#39;t Start After Windows 10 Update of 01Sep2015</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a smooth update to W10 about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine had rebooted the night of 01Sept and all the open apps were now closed. &nbsp;I assume this was a W10 update but its now so hard to tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem I noticed is that my HP all in one printer no longer worked and I had to re-install that driver. &nbsp;No big deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I attempted to open Quickbooks to enter some transactions but Quickbooks will no longer start. &nbsp; I've attached the error popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I responded about 5 times to the QB screen but they've not gotten back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who knows what happened during the dark of the night?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thnx in Advance</p>

            <p>After going through a somewhat painful process with QB customer support, the conclusion was that the QB file was corrupted by an improper shutdown of the application (apparently via the now fully automated W10 update process). &nbsp; By the way, it turns out
 that I ended up teaching first level QB support that if you hold the CRTL key during startup, you can skip the company file load and that makes and easy test to see if it is the QB software or the company file that is causing the problem. &nbsp;In my case, the
 software alone started fine. &nbsp;The first level person swore to me that there was no such function and once I got to the second level, I asked again and sure enough it was there. &nbsp;When QB called back, I requested that this info should go out to their entire
 1st level organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution came after two fresh software installs and many clean boots. &nbsp; First level customer service wanted me to revert to my last backup which was two weeks old and that would have involved re-inputting many transactions. &nbsp;I escalated the case and
 was able to get someone to upload the QB company file and to run it through a utility they have that can fix files that weren't closed properly. &nbsp; That process worked fine but did take a full business day to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lessons are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;More frequent and now automated backups of QB</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Close QB at the end of your work day to ensure that a W10 automated and improper shutdown doesn't burn you</p>
<p>
</p><p>What MS needs to do:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Learn how to do a proper shutdown on QB as part of their update automation that will update and reboot your machine down without your permission.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Perhaps give some level of control on the update process like a one business day warning on a reboot update.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Better to go to a system where the user gets to choose. &nbsp;This new approach may be convenient for MS but it has already cost me several hours and $89 for the escalated customer support to fix the file.</p>
<p>

    <title>Creating an Installation Disc for a clean install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> italianblessing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating an Installation Disc for a clean install</h2>
                    <p>I have a few questions because I need some clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) The following page explains how to create my own installation disc in case I should need to re-install Windows 10 - a clean installation. So I am supposed to click on the appropriate purple "Download Tool Now" button and that application is the Windows
 10 clean install app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>What confuses me is why does it not just say "Windows 10"? I am not certain that I am downloading the correct application. When I downloaded this app and placed it on my dvd the burning program says there is only 21MB of the 4.7GB disc being used which again
 makes me think that I am not downloading the appropriate app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) The following page url is contradictory to me. It says "Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device." Then in the fourth paragraph down it says "Windows 10 is automatically updated. Additional requirements may apply over time for updates.
 See the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Upgrade page</a> for details."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So which is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) When Windows 10 downloaded on my computer did it make a clean install? It appears to me that it did not because my personal things were still on my computer after the download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that if I try to do a clean install from a disc that I create if I am downloading the appropriate app or am I going to have troubles. Or is it necessary for me to do a clean install in order to receive updates or clear space on my hd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) I do not understand not having a product key even for a free upgrade. Microsoft cheated me once before out of the Office software on my brand new computer with a valid key so I have no trust at all in not having a product key.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per your query, I like to inform you that.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1) Download Tool Now option, enable you to download Media creation tool is an application, which allows to install Windows 10 in two way; Through Windows upgrade (Upgrade this PC option) and through Clean installation (Create installation media
 for another PC), this option allows you to create Windows 10 DVD/USB installation media to perform clean installation of Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer to the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2) If your System is running <strong>Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.1 Pro, and Windows 8.1 Pro for Students</strong> then only you will be able to get Windows 10 as free upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>“Windows 10 is automatically updated” </span></strong><span>it means, if your system meets the requirement to install Windows 10, you will receive automatically updates to Upgrade your System to Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3) If you download the updates and upgrade your system to Windows 10, it is just upgrading your system to Windows 10, all the files/program will not get affected. When you install Windows 10 using DVD media, with keeping the files/program then
 it is clean installation OF windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4) When you Upgrade your system to Windows 10, the activation server will create an activation key and it will be ejected in the motherboard. So, whenever you install Windows 10 in the same System with same Motherboard, the system will get activated
 automatically.</span></span></p>

            <p>Okay, I understand numbers 2, 3, and 4. To clarify my situation Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit came with my Dell computer so that is what I have been using. I did receive the "Free Upgrade to Windows 10" notification a couple of weeks ago or so. Then late
 last night I discovered a notification in my Windows Update that the download was available and ready so I downloaded it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I write from my computer with that free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several times in the past reinstalled the OS in my computers to clear up a problem. A few years ago I did reinstall the Windows 7 on this computer and that is when Microsoft refused to allow me to continue using my Office program. I should have been
 reimbursed something for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time I have only this one computer, and a tablet, but the tablet never received any message for a free upgrade and I don't even know what OS is operating on the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be interested in reinstalling the Windows 10 upgrade on my desktop computer as a 'clean install' (to free up space) and then reinstall my software but I want to understand that I am doing this correctly when I do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I save that file from the purple "Download Tool Now" button (file called MediaCreation Toolx64.exe) and save it to a dvd then I will be able to put this dvd into my pc drive, restart my pc and the pc will boot from that dvd to do a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the information I found at Microsoft about doing this with the free upgrade says that when the box comes up to enter the product key to click on "Skip" and my pc will be automatically activated by using the free upgrade offer. Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try this and it does not work then I will not be able to get help since this is my best internet connection on this computer, and being my only computer now having this one in working order is very vital for me.</p>

            <p>I think that I have created a bootable disc of Windows 10. I followed the directions on the page you gave me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is Windows.iso. It is over 3GB. Sound right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I never used the .iso tool (http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this so complicated to understand, but if I am using Windows 10 now, then why would I need to use a tool that is for Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do a clean install of Windows 10 on my pc now ... well, the pc is currently using Windows 10 already.</p>

<p><strong><span>Rename the software distribution folder </span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Stop the Windows Update service (make sure you are logged on as an Administrator)<br />
<br />
Start button || Control Panel ||System and Maintenance ||Administrative Tools<br />

Double-click Services <br />
(Provide the Administrator password or confirmation if prompted to do so.)<br />
Right-click the Windows Update service and click Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Important: </span></strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Restart the computer, and then run Windows Update again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Renaming the software distribution folder will erase your history on the Windows Update Site. Anytime you wish to check what updates are installed you can: -<br />
</span><span>Start button || Control Panel || Programs<br />
Under Programs and Features - click View installed updates.<br />
<span><br />
</span><strong>Rename the Catroot2 folder </strong><span><br />
<br />
1. Click&nbsp;Start, type&nbsp;cmd&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Start Search box, right-click&nbsp;cmd.exe, and then click&nbsp;Run as administrator.<br />
2. At the command prompt, type the following commands, and then press ENTER after each line:</span> &nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
</span><strong>net stop cryptsvc&nbsp;<span><br />
</span>ren %systemroot%\System32\Catroot2 oldcatroot2&nbsp;<span><br />
</span>net start cryptsvc&nbsp;<span><br />
</span>exit</strong><span><br />
<br />
3. Delete all tmp*.cat files from the following folder:</span> &nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
%systemroot%\system32\CatRoot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}</span> &nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
If no files that start with “tmp” exist in this folder, do not remove any other files. The .cat files in this folder are necessary for installing hotfixes and service packs.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Important:</span><span><span>&nbsp;Do not rename the Catroot folder. The Catroot2 folder is automatically recreated by Windows, but the Catroot folder
 is not recreated if the Catroot folder is renamed.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Pop-up Ads &#40;while NOT on the internet&#41;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasackley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pop-up Ads &#40;while NOT on the internet&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I just received another Windows 10 pop-up ad while not on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The impulse this triggered in me was to recall that extended support for windows 7 doesn't expire until 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thoughts, in part, due to this aggressive campaign to get everyone using Windows 10 are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not, favorably, impressed by Windows 10 for the year that I was a Windows 10 insider (hoping to affect changes to make it desirable). I am now more negatively impressed with Microsoft, for invading my privacy with pop-up ads when I'm not even "out
 in public", on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I believe, with the possible exception of one installation of Windows 8.1 (possibly even worse than Windows 10), I'll leave Windows 7 (and 1 instance of XP) on my PC's. My rationale: They'll probably get me soon enough with Windows 10 as I buy
 replacement PC's in 5 years or so (If I haven't gone to Apple by then). I'm even less likely than I was to switch to Windows 10, since being "raped" by Microsofts ad campaign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who's with me?</p>

            Hi Peed,<br />
<br />
Which game from Phantom EFX do you have?&nbsp; <br />
Have you check the compatibility center for the game?&nbsp; Is it listed in there?<br />

<p>After I install my windows 7 ultimate, I find that there is a malfunction of the screen brightness control everytime I wake my laptop from hibernating. The brightness control is no problem when I restart my windows, but somehow, the brightness control&nbsp;disappear
 after wake up from hibernating. Also&nbsp;each time, I wake up from hibernating,&nbsp;it will automatically reset the brightness to the highest.&nbsp;Is there&nbsp;a way to solve this problem?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like a driver problem for me. Follow these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check if updating display drivers can help. Log
 on to the computer manufacturer website and update the latest display drivers along with the chipset and other available drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check if you have the latest Windows Updates
 installed. Check for the optional updates as it may have the required drivers.</span></p>

<h2>            Boot Disk Failure in Windows 8 64-Bi.. help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; My install of Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit went great. It was a clean install to replace my Vista Home Premium 32-Bit. I bought the DVD and more memory as required. Mother board was loaded&nbsp;and capable&nbsp;of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem is that I have to boot my beautifully new program with a system disk. If not, I get nothing but a message that says, "Boot disk failure insert system disk and press enter. I must have messed up disabling my floppy drive that I don't have. Any
 idea where to go from here to fix it? Now I'm exhausted and confused. While it's running, it's great. I could go and never power it off, but we get lightening&nbsp;storms here and I feel safer doing that.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting to Microsoft community, based on your post I understand you manage to setup Windows 8
 successfully but when restart the computer you get and error message: Disk Boot Failure- Insert disk and press enter This might be linked to:</span></p>
<p><span>. The boot options not correctly set in BIOS
</span></p>
<p><span>. To set the boot option refer to your computer manufacturer website, how to go to BIOS and change the boot
 sequence as it differs from one manufacturer to other. </span></p>
<p><span>· A non - bootable CD is found in your CD drive · the hard disk is not properly plugged
</span></p>
<p><span>· Your system files have been infected Please reply if you need further assistance.
</span></p>
<p>I would suggest performing the following methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Restart the computer by force&nbsp;shut down.</strong><br />
Once the computer restarts check if you are getting the same error message. If the error message exists, perform Method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Perform Startup repair</strong><br />
I would suggest you to perform a startup repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’. <br />
d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</p>
<p><b>Method 3: Perform Check Disk</b></p>
<p>1. Have you initiated the Check disk or is it starting automatically?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any recent changes on the Windows 8 system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>You may try to boot from the Windows 8 DVD and try performing an Automatic repair from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</p>
<p>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 8 computer follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. <b>Insert the media</b> such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer</p>
<p>b. <b>Press F12</b> key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers)and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</p>
<p>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</p>
<p>c. Click Next and select <b>Repair your computer</b>. </p>
<p>d. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option <b>
Troubleshoot</b> and select <b>Advanced options</b>.<br />
e. You may choose <b>Automatic Repair</b> from Advanced boot option. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>If you are still facing issues then you may try performing a check disk booting from the DVD by following above steps..</p>
<p>a. From <b>Repair your computer </b>choose the option <b>Troubleshoot</b> and select
<b>Advanced options</b>.<br />
b. You may choose <b>Command prompt.</b></p>
<p>c. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER</p>
<p><b>chkdsk /f /r &nbsp;X:( drive letter)</b></p>
<p>d. Press <b>Y</b> when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.
</p>
<p>e. <b>Restart</b> the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running check disk.</p>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>

            I installed Windows 8 pro upgrade on my Windows 7 machine (very stable w/ win 7).
<div><br />
<div>Lost my DVD, and Media Center (that I had with Win7) - Side problem, but may be related as it forced me to cycle through a number of install cycles to try to upgrade...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tried to add features for Media Center. Bought a Key , then realized there was a free key for Media Center. Tried both. Installer fails after reboot and fails to add media center. Hence the many re-boots etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8 Pro Worked ok without the Media Center for a week,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I get a DISK BOOT FAILURE, randomly. PC Wont boot ever after any power cycle.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could be a HDD going bad, but it seems too coincident with the Win8 install and Media Center Updgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no Win8 CD as it was an upgrade.</div>
<div>I may try Ultimate Boot Disk to repair boot sector, or check HDD health.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />

            Turned out it was the order my computer was booting. I went into Bios once and noticed a&nbsp;Floppy drive and right off thought, "FLOPPY DRIVE! I don't own a floppy drive!, I'll get rid of that!" Will in some confusion as to how it all works, I inadvertently
 turned things around. I went back in after repeated re-installs didn't work. I wrote everything down for myself just in case I forgot what order it was in before. It took 15 minutes to get up and running perfectly. Now I simply need to learn my new system!
 Thank yawl so much for helping or trying to help as the case may be.&nbsp; YEA!!! for the community!

            I was lucky enough to have the DVD so I could re-install. It wasn't the install though. Several support people had me re-install. I kept telling them I didn't think that was the problem and it wasn't. It was all in the boot. Thanks for the assist though.
 Hope you got your problem solved.

            Good answers and advice, all of it. I do wish I had gotten the command prompt info sooner. &nbsp;I had already repaired the problem though. I'm very impatient!&nbsp;It would have been much less time consuming your way. Thanks for going into detail. I'm sure many
 will be assisted here.

            <p>I'm running into the same issue where I get "Boot disk failure insert system disk and press enter" every time I boot without a Windows 8 disk,&nbsp;but neither of the above methods worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1 said Windows cannot be repaired</p>
<p>Method 2 said "The type of the file system is NTFS. Cannot lock current drive. Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Had the same aforementioned issue and found out its an outdated BIOS that was causing it. I downloaded and flashed a more recent one and got rid of the problem. It was an Asus p5n-e sli in my case.&nbsp;
