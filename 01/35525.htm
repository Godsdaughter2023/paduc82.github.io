<h2>            File System Error &#40;-1073741521&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in a bit of a pickle, and I hope someone might help me sort it out. The following text might NOT be complete and chronologically ordered, as most of the actions taken to correct the issue have been carried out before Christmas (busy time of year, didn't
 have time to pick up after, memory might be blurry). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Win 10 PRO machine, an ultrabook running an i7-3537U, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD. I can start Windows and log on, but that's where the problems start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that suddenly File System Error (-1073741521) started popping up, preventing me from running anything with Administrative Privileges and preventing me from running executable files. When running Office programs (in particular), I get MSIMG32.dll
 is missing, although if I get to its path manually, it is safe and sound in its place. I can create files, use notepad (which is weirdly enough an executable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>do not remember</strong> whether I have installed anything prior to that (like Windows Update for example), but I am almost firmly convinced that it could not have been the result of malicious code being ran without my knowledge on this machine.
 I cannot correlate the error showing up to anything I've done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken to correct the action, in somewhat chronological order: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From my administrative account on the machine: <strong>nothing</strong> because I cannot run any executables (except notepad...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. From another administrative account on the machine: <strong>nothing</strong>, because although I can run executables, I cannot run elevated ones.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. From external Windows Installation Media (USB): </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Startup Repair </strong>fails miserably. </li><li><strong>chkdsk /f /r&nbsp; -</strong> identified errors and fixed them, hard disk is healthy<span><strong>.</strong></span></li><li><strong>sfc /scannow /offbootdir=C:\ /offwindir=C:\windows</strong> - found errors, returned error message that "was unable to fix some of them".<br />
</li><li><strong>dism </strong><strong>/image:C:\offline /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
</strong>could not repair because it lacked sources. After extracting install.wim and specifying it as a source, it still says it cannot find the sources (I have extracted Win 10 PRO from the esd, to wim).</li></ul>
<p>4. From Safe Mode (actually took me a while to figure out how to put W10 in Safe Mode, shame on me):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact same things happen, just that this time <strong>dism</strong> gets through to 80% or so and then fails because (<em>I imagine</em>) it attempts to contact to the update server, and that service is disabled in Safe Mode (Error 1084 - this service
 cannot be started in safe mode). If I specify the source and use /limitaccess so it does not contact the update server...yes, it still fails because it cannot find the sources. It MIGHT be that I have not extracted the right version from the ESD, or that I
 have not used the command properly (never had to in 30 years actually), but it is somewhat confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Could I perhaps force it to use Windows Update? </strong></p>
<p>Going on: </p>
<p>Scans by Norton, MalwareBytes and Windows MSRT find no tampering with files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Repair is an option, and a valid one at that, but not for me. I must save this machine in this exact state.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still going around in circles from Safe Mode to offline booting, trying the same things over and over again. Is there anyone around here that might be interested in scratching their heads together with me on this one and who also has the patience to
 deal with someone stubborn enough to try and fix it, not simply drop it and reinstall it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what info/logs/partial logs could I provide? I have not had the patience to go through Event Viewer yet, to see if that shows anything. Not sure it logs for more than a week anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance and Happy Holidays folks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duke</p>

            Hi Duke.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run a full scan with Malwarebytes free scanner: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />You can turn off the free trial at any time in the app's Settings &gt; Accounts.  
<br />
<br />With that much going wrong, I'd wipe the drive and reinstall.  Here's why:  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair what you have, then in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> if necessary:  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />In Step 10 I'll walk you through getting the mounted image detected to fix the .wim image so it has a pristine files source to repair the broken System files.  But if not then the next step is the Repair Install which cannot be run in Safe Mode, so you'd have to create the media or download the ISO to mount it, see if you can get it to run Setup to repair upgrade:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope have the full range of options helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the comprehensive answer! </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not mind, before going through the first part, I will attempt the second one. The stubbornness comes from the fact that since the computer boots and identifies errors, but comes to a stop when fixing them because of underlying errors makes me think
 that it CAN be done, but something in my syntax (or extraction of the wim, or order of the steps) is amiss.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixing it by clean install or refresh is the easy option, but I'm not going to learn anything from that and it's not that challenging, you know? :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your answer and for your availability to wingman on this one, I'll go through the steps you suggest in the "let's try and fix it" part and will report back as things go along.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I - or could it help - if I posted any sort of logs from SFC or DISM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duke</p>

            I do not read CBS logs because my experience doing this ten years and tens of thousands of cases is that if SFC cannot repair the files with a DISM-confirmed pristine image, a Repair install will fix it faster and much more efficiently that fumbling around trying to manually replace broken files.

<p>Dear Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to solve the issue with a less standard approach. After still encountering the "Unable to find source" error when running
<strong>dism</strong> (I still have NO idea what I was doing wrong), an idea struck me: I noticed that the problems came with ".exe" files that needed UAC permissions to run, any others (like ProduKey) I could run just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I did was disable UAC from Safe Mode, enabled the local admin account (I do not know if this made a difference or not, I have simply enabled it to play with this option outside of my account and files, in case of unidentified malware and/or corrupting
 the profile on top of the file system). </p>
<p>
</p><p>After disabling UAC I was able to run <strong>dism </strong>without the need for source specifying, as this time it could simply access WSUS/WU without the restrictions imposed by Safe Mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked. It has repaired the file system errors, I was able to run <strong>sfc
</strong>afterwards and am now in the process of my third or fourth malware check - just in case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I will <strong>refresh</strong> the Windows Install, as <strong>sfc
</strong>still found some errors. But everything is looking good at this point, all DLLs have been fixed, ShellExperience is working good again and UAC has no issues albeit re-enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope my solution MIGHT help someone else in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg, I want to thank you very much again for taking the time to post that extensive reply, and for your dedication. I read your profile and was impressed by this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Holidays, Happy New Year and all the best!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duke</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 shut down accessibility</h2>
                    Since the last Windows 10 update, my father is having trouble&nbsp;seeing the power prompt to shut down his computer. He's elderly (98 yrs old) with vision problems. Is there any way I can set up an icon on his desktop that will lead to the "snooze, shut down,
 restart" prompt? If not, does anyone know of a quick command to get to the login screen? The power button there is more visible than on the desktop so that might be a good alternative.

</p><p>We don't have a way to set up an icon on your desktop that will lead to Power options. But we do have shortcut keys on how to get to the login screen easily. Just press
<strong>Windows key+L</strong>, then it will lock the screen. You will see the Power button at the lower-right corner of the screen.</p>

    <title>Bizarre Framerate&#47;Performance Problems On Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uncha1n3d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bizarre Framerate&#47;Performance Problems On Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since mid March, I've been having this maddening problem with my Xbox one. I will turn the console on(either from the front power button or controller), the game will boot up fine, but then when the game launches I'm greeted with horrendous lag. I dont
 mean network related lag either. I'm referring to a severe graphical slowdown as if the consoles CPU is completely bogged. The frame rate is choppy, the game seems to move in slow motion(Id say around the mid 20's in terms of frames per second) and even the
 resolution seems off.</p>

<p>Now a little background. I would consider myself an advanced user(I work in IT after all). Im fully aware of the Xbox One's memory issues and how properly flushing the ram with hard resets pretty much fixes everything, but I have yet to read up on this Exact
 issue from anyone else after many days of researching the problem. I DO NOT ever use Instant on mode. I have ALWAYS used energy saving. Since I got the console I have had my power supply plugged into a standard surge protector with no issues(until recently
 Ive read I actually should have been plugging it into the wall), which I now do. I run my Xbox One directly into an Asus MX239H monitor at 1080p. I have all of my games on a Seagate Expansion Plus external drive to read from. I directly connect to the monitor
 without any bypasses whatsoever. When the issue occurs(unplayable graphics rendering, if you will), there are only two ways in which I have corrected the problem:</p>
<p>*Keep in mind I have had this issue with many different games(Wolfenstein: The old Blood, Resident Evil Revelations 2, Devil May Cry Definitive, State of Decay..etc)</p>
<p>1. Launch a different game(that runs normally), then come back to the game where I was having the problem</p>
<p>2. Hard reset the xbox(go figure)</p>
<p>*Regular resets cause this to happen randomly, and once the issue 'triggers', it doesnt go away unless I cold/force boot the console&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have tried a ridicules amount of troubleshooting steps. Here are just 'some' of the ridicules things ive tried to get the console to work properly</p>
<p>1. Tried different cables, monitors, and wall outlets.</p>
<p>2. Ran the games from two different hard drives(internal and external)</p>
<p>3. Performed a Factory Reset</p>
<p>4. Shut off network connectivity and reboot(in the case where a spotty internet could be causing an issue)</p>
<p>5. Manipulated electrical devices in room to see if I could trigger the issue(possible electrical spikes?)</p>
<p>6. Reinstalled said games to the hard drive.</p>

<p>As a final note, I generally only use my Xbox One for gaming. The most I will do is run Netflix. I barely ever snap anything(mainly because its clunky) or fail to close apps, and when this problem arises(and its quite often), its literally after starting
 the Xbox, then running the game. This has happened on both physical AND digital games. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Id like to imagine there's a hardware issue(or maybe even a faulty power supply not giving the motherboard enough juice), but
 I dunno. The last thing Im going to try later today involves deleting a single game causing issues, unplug the external drive, then factory resetting the Xbox again(just to rule out possible corrupt files or software glitches). I have many games, but would
 that really cause the console to run like absolute crap? I literally have to hard reset every day(If the last boot wasnt a cold one). Im stumped.</p>

<p>Hey Uncha1n3d,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on the Community Support Forums!</p>
<p>From reading over your issue - it is clear there is some performance-related issue, the question is, where is the issue, and what is the cause. This is something we need to figure out here.</p>
<p>The games you've mentioned I believe are quite graphically intensive.</p>
<p>Have you tried any less-intensive games? Some examples are Call of Duty, Minecraft or Goat Simulator.</p>
<p>It would be good to see the results from those games, if possible.</p>
<p>Let me know if you can try some less-intensive games!</p>

<p>I will definitely see what happens with Minecraft since I own that game. Im not sure what it will reveal whether it runs well or not, but it will be interesting to see if those kinds of games will produce similar results. Any other suggestions are welcome</p>

<p>Tat1664,</p>
<p>I ALWAYS boot straight into the dashboard. I know theres an option to resume playback or to automatically launch the disc but I actually have never selected those options so Im not sure how they work. Weird thing is the dashboard loads everything fine and
 doesnt seem to stutter. It only occurs when Im actually playing the game. Sometimes it happens when I hit a certain loading point(where it can be replicated over and over) and sometimes its almost 'stuck' in a low performance state and will remain unless I
 launch another game(which seems to stop it temporarily) then fire it back up again. Hard resets always correct the problem for a couple regular shut-downs but it surfaces so often that it gets fairly annoying.</p>

                    Hi,
<div>Usually when I put in dvds or cds in my laptop, windows media player starts up and the movie starts or the cd uploads. However, yesterday when I tried to watch a movie, my DVD/CD drive wouldn't read the disc. It closed then tried reading it but then made
 a sound and didn't work. i tried all the dvds in my room and it wouldn't not work for any of them. I have no idea why, so I was hoping one you could tell me. :)&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>I'm working for a company that is designing a case around the Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;Is there a program to get the Surface Pro 4 3D data? &nbsp;We would only need the external geometry, nothing inside. &nbsp;If there is a program that already exists, phone number or any
 avenue we can pursue it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp; I also am looking for a detailed breakdown of all the Surface Pro 4&nbsp;components, port placements, and dimensions. Unfortunately, the document provided above is&nbsp;not what I am searching for.&nbsp; I once downloaded a PDF with&nbsp;Surface device&nbsp;schematics from
 the Designed For Surface partner program site.&nbsp; The PDF&nbsp;was maybe&nbsp;25-30&nbsp;pages in length and contained very detailed&nbsp;schematics for&nbsp;multiple devices -&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;the Surface 2, Pro 2 and Pro 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an updated version of this document for the Surface Pro
 4, I would very much appreciate a copy or direction in acquiring it.</p>
<p>

<h3> yurgi windu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I keep getting disconnected from Xbox live when playing backwards compatible games on my Xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone suggest why I keep getting randomly disconnected from Xbox Live when playing backwards compatible Xbox 360 titles on my Xbox One even though my Xbox One is still connected to Xbox Live?&nbsp; To clarify it is the backwards compatible game that disconnects
 on the emulated xbox 360 software not my xbox one which is still connected fine.&nbsp; This happens regularly and randomly.&nbsp; It is causing me.to get disconnected during games and is driving me crazy.&nbsp; To clarify a few points</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I am using a wired ethernet connection.</p>
<p>* If I am in an xbox live party and hosting a multiplayer game I dont seem to get disconnected but as soon as I play solo I start getting disconnects.</p>
<p>* I have tried a hard reset on my xbox one</p>
<p>* I have tried clearing the cache on the BC 360 through the system menu on the xbox one.</p>
<p>* I have re-downloaded my profile on&nbsp; the the X1 and BC 360.</p>
<p>* I have tried using a different gamer profile</p>
<p>* I have set up port forwarding on both my X1 and BC 360 through my router.</p>
<p>* This happens on all BC 360 games both disc versions and digital downloads</p>
<p>* My router is a Sagecom modem router provided by Plusnet in the Uk</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing I have tried is fixing this and the disconnects just keep happening every single time I play a BC game.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to fix this or what is causing it?</p>

So I tried this a couple of days ago.&nbsp; Successfully completed a soft factory reset.&nbsp; First I played a BC game went out and left it running for an hour, came back and xbox one is connected to xbox live, BC game has disconnected.&nbsp; As soon as I hot connect to
 xbox live on the BC game it re-connects.&nbsp; There is no reason why is should be disconnecting in the first place, so essentially this hasn't worked although I will do some more rigorous testing.

<p>I have sent them messages every which way I can, direct messages to xbox support on twitter, filled out forms on website to contact them and not as much as an acknowledgement that they have even read my messages.&nbsp; I get the impression microsoft dont really
 care or have no clue what is going wrong because I can see from other posts my issue is not an isolated one.</p>

</p><blockquote>What happens when you try to reconnect?
</blockquote>
<p>If I do it immediately when it disconnects it either goes one of two way it either re-connects or it gives me a message that it can't connect and if I want to test my connection it will need to sign everyone one etc.&nbsp; Frequently when I do re-connect it immediately
 disconnects again after about 10 seconds.&nbsp; It can take an hour or two before the first disconnect happens but once it does it tends to be constant every 5 or 10 minutes even if I do re-connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarity as well I very ocassionally get disconnected from Xbox Live on my Xbox one but I am talking maybe once every few weeks and tends to only be when there are service issues.&nbsp; On the BC games it is 95% of the times I play them.</p>

<p>Hi Yurgi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been seeing a few more reports about the Xbox 360 emulator on the Xbox One not connecting to Xbox Live, but Xbox One games are connecting fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance are you apart of the Xbox Insider program? I've noticed that these reports started coming in around the same time a preview update was sent out to a few insider rings and it could be related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way I also recommend contacting Xbox customer support and report the issue through there to create a case for you.</p>

<h2>            After recent update, graphics card is shown as not connected, error 45 on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: After Windows 10 update graphics card is shown as not connected</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a routine cumulative update to Windows 10 for x64 systems (as per KB3163018), on restart the &nbsp;the graphics card (Nvidia GE Force GTX 760) is now shown in device manager as not being connected (error 45). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions advised to others that have had the same problem have not worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>- using the hardware troubleshooter.</p>
<p>- Nvidia drivers are current having been updated earlier in June and having worked fine up to this Windows update. &nbsp;Nvidia applications such as diagnostics and driver updater do not run as they cannot identify any Nvidia cards. &nbsp;The Alienware diagnostics
 do not detect the Nvidia graphics card</p>
<p>- BIOS options have been changed so that the default graphics adapter is set to discrete rather than automatic</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing I have not yet tried is to dismantle the PC to remove and physically reinstall the graphics card. &nbsp;Any suggestions before I am forced to do this?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jim,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above error code might occur if the device which was connected before is now disconnected on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, did you check if the graphics card are detected under
<strong>Device manager</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have tried hardware and devices troubleshooter, if haven’t tried, check if the graphics card is detected under
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Device manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand <strong>Display adapter</strong> option and check if the graphics card/s is detected on the computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If detected, right click on the driver and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong> from the context menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the driver to be uninstalled.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After the driver is uninstalled, restart the computer and check if the drivers are reinstalled.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If the issue persists, download and install the latest and most compatible graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, contact the BIOS manufacturer website or refer to the BIOS manual to make changes to the BIOS settings. It is best to contact the BIOS manufacturer
 to guide you appropriately in modifying the BIOS settings to prevent any incorrect settings which might result in an unresponsive computer.</span></p>

            <p>The graphics card is not identified in Device Manager except by showing hidden entries - this shows the graphics card, but indicates it is no longer connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Windows is set to install updates automatically. &nbsp;Last night I shut down the desktop PC and chose the option to update and shut down. &nbsp;This morning when it was turned on the screen remained black until the monitor delivered a message there was no
 signal on HDMI1. &nbsp;I connected the HDMI port on the mother board to the HDMI2 port on the monitor and could use this to see what was happening. &nbsp;In device manager, the only display adapter showing is Intel HD Graphics 4600. &nbsp;On reviewing hidden entries I could
 see the Nvidia card. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is feasible that the Nvidia card became unseated just after an update, but as the likelihood is very low indeed (the computer was not moved or touched in between shutting down and powering on) I wanted to try other options before dismantling the computer.</p>

I went to account settings and subscriptions and it says I own it so I'm not sure why it's not working. This is very frustrating and there's no good reason for it! I've barely had my Xbox for a month and I've already had many problems with it.&nbsp;Can someone please help me with this? Any help at all would be&nbsp;greatly appreciated!</p>

            Excuse me but I've been having the exact same problem now and it's been over 24 hours since I purchased 1 month of xbox live gold and it still won't let me play online, and yet every person that I see has had the same problem, the only answer that xbox
 support can come up with is "remove your account and recover it again", even though I've already done that, reset my xbox, tested my internet and multiplayer connection, restarted my console, launched multiplayer games over and over again to no avail, and
 am STILL completely unable to access any multiplayer interactions THAT I PAID FOR.

<p>
</p><p>I really cannot rule it out yet, if RAM is the one causing the problem on your Skype app. But is your issue happening to 1 specific contact or to multiple Skype contacts? Also, what is the exact Skype version that is installed on your Windows 7?</p>

<p>To better investigate this behavior, could you provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your detailed OS version and Office version. (PowerPoint&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information)</span></li><li><span>Please create a new presentation and insert a new video to see whether the issue occurs with particular presentation/videos.</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether this behavior occurs when you open the video with other player rather than insert and play it in PowerPoint.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I create a new Powerpoint and insert a new video, the problem happens and the video displays with&nbsp;over saturated colors.
</p>
<p>I noticed that if I play the video with Movie &amp; TV (from the video folder), it plays well with the right colors.</p>
<p>However, if I use Windows Media Player, the colors are over saturated like in Powerpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are up to date (display adapter &amp; Monitor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Bruno,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the information you provided.<br />
<br />
I tested with the same office version as yours but failed to repro. To further investigate, could you provide the following information:<br />
1. Your OS version.<br />
2. Did PowerPoint work previously properly? If so, did you make any changes?<br />
3. Please send a sample presentation to your colleague who uses the same Office and OS version with you to see the outcome.<br />
4. Please upload that sample presentation to OneDrive, and then open it in PowerPoint Online to see the outcome.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Zixuan<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. OS version:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/106c5563-88db-4688-85c8-b7be6f50e952?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/106c5563-88db-4688-85c8-b7be6f50e952?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Powerpoint did work properly in the past. I did not make any conscious change to the system which is being updated automatically by my company</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If I send the Presentation to a colleague, the video will play correctly on their laptop. No over saturated colors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If I upload the Powerpoint presentation on OneDrive and play it online, it displays the right colors. No oversaturated colors using Powerpoint Online</p>
<p>

<p>I have an Asus t100 with windows 8. &nbsp;My computer will not let me download or upload anything. &nbsp;I have tried to download updates and the progress for the download remains at 0%. &nbsp;I also have tried to attach documents to emails and it sends me off the internet.
 &nbsp;What do I need to do to fix this problem? </p>

            Hi Jonathan,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which browser do you use to download and upload files?</div>
<div>
<p>2. Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior <br />
to the issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If you are using Internet Explorer, then is it the desktop version or Modern Interface Internet Explorer?
</p>
<p>
</p><div>Trying Internet Explorer in&nbsp;<strong>No-addons mode</strong> may help in getting the issue resolved.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform the steps mentioned below if you use Internet Explorer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to check the following settings.</div>
<div><strong>a.</strong> Close any Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer windows that are currently open.</div>
<div><strong>b. </strong>Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, clicks the <strong>
Tools </strong>button, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>c.</strong> Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, click on Internet, and then click the<strong> Custom
</strong>level button.</div>
<div><strong>d.</strong> Scroll down to the <strong>Downloads</strong> category, and set
<strong>File download</strong> to enable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if it helps.
<div>&nbsp;
<p><strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer </strong></p>
<div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to attach documents using No-addons mode enable one add on at a time to see which addon&nbsp;is creating the problem, if Issue persists you can Reset Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Change or reset Internet Explorer settings</strong></span>
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security
 settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are you referring to windows updates, when&nbsp;you say <strong>
"I have tried to download updates and the progress for the download remains at 0%."?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then try the steps from the link mentioned below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.

    <title>Xbox Games Disappearing from Ready To Install List - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derpypandit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Games Disappearing from Ready To Install List</h2>
                    <p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I've been seeing the same thread everywhere dating back to 2016-17 but with no legit solution.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>The subject of thread pretty much explains the issue. Xbox games are disappearing from the ready to install list.</p>
<p>Was just playing Fallout 76 last night, all was well. Pull up the game today: and it force closes after some time with a notice saying: "Game took too long to start". So I followed the steps accordingly to try and fix the issue. Hard reset, cleared cache,
 etc. etc. Still same error. This had happened to me before: so I figured to uninstall and reinstall the game: since that has worked in the past.
</p>
<p>This is where the real issue happens;</p>
<p>As soon as I uninstall, the game is no longer showing up in my "Ready to install" list. When I search for it in the store: it tells me I have to purchase the game: when I obviously already have it.<br />
The only suggestions I've currently come across is to hard reset the console by holding the power button/unplugging: or unhiding your games from the list. Neither has worked.&nbsp;<br />
Everytime i pull up my Ready to Install list, I clearly see the number of games reduce in front of my eyes. First starting at 200, then it'll drop to 197, then 191: within a matter of seconds. I honestly can't pin point what other games are missing, just Fallout
 76 since it was what I recently played and had installed. So I literally have no way of knowing what games in my list are just magically disappearing or even how long it's been going on.</p>
<p>The most aggravating thing about this is that the Microsoft Store is literally telling me I need to purchase the game, so I'm assuming that *somehow* the title of the game was ripped from my account: so it no longer registers that I own the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repeating the steps&nbsp;I already took: hard reset, unhide games, etc. No change, it's as if I never purchased the game in the first place.</p>
<p>Help. :C&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>Yes, and this is where the lines start getting in the "grey area" as they call it. You only get 5 home xbox uses a year. They are meant for your home xbox. Not your brothers/sisters or extended family.
 When you designate a console as your home xbox. You're saying it's YOUR home xbox and that you will be using it as your main Xbox. If you sign into your brothers Xbox and make it your Home ( just an example) And your brother makes purchases, uses your account
 and gets a ban, collects account &nbsp;info while you're signed in and &nbsp;not looking, Then uses that info later to do anything unauthorized guess what? There is no recourse, You are 100% responsible for all of that. People lose accounts all the time, even to family
 members, People get bans all the time, because of family members. A lot can happen, which is why they don't allow it. Even with family. There is a "grey area" and some people find ways to work around things, But it's risky and not encouraged&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>There are always grey areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, "your brother" should never be logging in as you, your account doesn't need to be on that console. They should be using their own account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As quoted from Xbox "<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The console designated as your home Xbox is where you can share games and some content with others who sign in (with their own account) to
 that console". You are most certainly NOT sharing your account and never should.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
Of course there are users who will try and bend the rules beyond where they should be, and they should indeed be punished for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
