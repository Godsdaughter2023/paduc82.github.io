<h2>            Need more accurate computer diagnostic tools to find  and fix problems</h2>
                    <p><b><span><em>Original Title: Why does nothing work?</em></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Why are there no accurate computer diagnostic tools? OK. So I have some computer problems. It is not recognizing the sound card and several other things, six in all, yellow exclamation marks beside the DVD drive, OHCI compliant something or other,
 generic PnP Monitor, the processor (fer gawd's sake, how is it even working?), HD sound card and the PCA standard ISA bridge.
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Oh yeah, first of all its a virus, then it is OEM software, so contact them. With all this, the last advice I can get is to reformat the drive and reload Win7, oh yes, and reload all my software, that at least two weeks work. And if that does not
 fix it, it is a hardware problem!! Why don't we just replace the mobo and see if that is it?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>It is like having car problems and the garage says, "Oh yeah, we will just replace the motor and power train and see if that is the problem. If it is still there, it might be the chassis.".<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>What I want is a diagnostic tool that will examine the computer and pinpoint the problem and fix it. Is this too much to ask - Bill Gates? We have this for our cars. After all this time, it should be possible. In computer problems, there is way
 too much try this, try that. Time to switch to MAC... or Linux.</span></b></p>

            Oh great! A discussion! You are right, I could make a fortune. I will work on that, but likely by the time we get all the solutions, there will be something better. Unfortunately, this does not answer the question, and who do YOU work for? Microsoft SEEMS
 to be going in this direction. I did see a beta test of some tools. Of course, there is always that great resource, the Internet...<br />

            <p><span>Type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press ENTER. Are there any yellow question marks in
 Device Manager? If yes what is the Device Error code. </span></p>
<p><span>To see Hidden Devices (Non Plug and Play Drivers) you need
 to select View, Show Hidden Devices. It is necessary to do this every time you open Device Manager if you need to see them.</span></p>
<p><span>A further complication can be Ghosted Devices –installed
 but not connected!</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/windows/2005/04/29/display-hidden-devices-in-device-manager-xp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lockergnome.com/windows/2005/04/29/display-hidden-devices-in-device-manager-xp/</a></span></p>
<p>Select Start, Control Panel. Action Center, Click on the Arrow down to the right of Maintenance and then on View reliability history. In the graph
 you will see red orbs, Click on one and it gives details and to the right is another link saying View technical details. Can you copy and paste the description in a further message. Repeating reports are more relevant than one off problems.</p><span>Here
 are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system errors and warnings, even if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application
 problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting the earlier errors can resolve later ones.</span>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution.
 Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes
 System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side
 of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to
 click a second time to see the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on
 the Copy button on the General tab to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports
 that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports.
 Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on
 the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

            <p>I think that, in your present situation, a re-install would be the best way out of your mess. You may still have some infection in there and your system is in tatters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install your other software as you need it, not so much of a sojourn as trying to installl everything in one sitting.</p>
<p>It will also allow you to monitor hardware and performance as you go..</p>

<p>Re diags.. a Jeep I6 4.0 Litre is what it is, as is a GM L7.&nbsp;There is no standard PC, especially if ti has been&nbsp;running for a while. There are as many permutations as the odds of winning the lottery.&nbsp;</p>

            This look like good advice that will take me awhile to go through. The yellow exclams all say code 3, which as far as I can tel,l does not mean much. In the action centre, I can't find any "View reliability History", so I am not sure where to go with that.

<p><span><span>Code 3: The driver for this device might be corrupted, or your system may be running low on memory or other resources</span></span></p>
<p><span>Updated: August 31, 2007</span></p>
<p><span>Applies To: Windows Server 2008</span></p>
<p><span>Device Manager displays the following message in the Device Properties dialog box, on the General tab, in the Device Status text box:</span></p>
<p><span>The driver for this device might be corrupted, or your system may be running low on memory or other resources. (Code 3)</span></p>
<p><span>Diagnosis</span></p>
<p><span>The driver cannot successfully load because it is corrupted, or because there is not enough memory to run the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>Resolution</span></p>
<p><span>If the driver is corrupted, uninstall the driver and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again. To scan for new hardware, click the Action
 menu in Device Manager, and then click Scan for hardware changes.</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer has insufficient memory to run the driver, you can close some applications to make memory available. To check memory and system resources,
 click Start, All Programs, Accessories, Systems Tools, and then click System Information. You may have to install additional random access memory (RAM).<br />

            <p>Considering the amount of issues that you have, it is every bit the answer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virus infections these days are not the same as they were. There was a time when a simple system restore would take them out. So the virus writers made sure that restore points were infected too.</p>
<p>When they realized that users were deleting restore points, fixing the issues and then creating new restore points, the virus writers took to trashing the OS to the point where little works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where you are today. So you have choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can spend hours, maybe days, trying to recover it bit by bit but eventually succumbing to a total re-install..
</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>You can save yourself the time and re-install now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system may well report back as being virus free but you can't be sure 100% and if&nbsp;just one of the original&nbsp;virus functions is still active, you lose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the perfect opportunity to start over, install your important stuff and create a system image&nbsp;which can be used to get over issues like this very quickly in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's your choice of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Fmiyata,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to turn off Windows Media player and then turn on the feature which is as good as uninstalling and reinstalling it,
 check if it helps you fix the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><strong><span><br />
<strong><span>Uninstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><br />
</span></strong><span>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and uncheck the mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the computer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Step 2</span></strong> <br />
<strong><span>Reinstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and place a check mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below for more information on the above steps to turn off or on the features in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></span></p>
<span>
<p><span>If uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Media player does not help, you may run System File Checker (SFC) scan
 and check if it can help you fix the issue of opening Windows Media player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run SFC Scan follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            windows cardspace</h2>
                    hello, I have no idea when this was installed on my computer, but I just noticed it tonight when I went into the control panel.When I clicked on it to see what it was it told me I could not access it? for administrators only? I am the admin and the only
 user on this computer. Googling it it say's the program was installed with a windows update, which by coincidence I did today, but have had many since the last time I was in the control panel. OK so my question is 2 fold: 1 wouldn't I have had an option if
 I wanted this thing? and or the ability to access it or delete it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. it does not allow me to open it? could this be an malicious installation of a hacker/spyware/keylogger<br />
<br />
Why would Microsoft install a program that can't be opened by the admin? I running windows XP pro sp3 ver 32 However I have a split hard drive with vista on the other side that I'm never on (it's a disaster)<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t install Intel&#40;R&#41; HD Family Graphics 4000 driver</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my ASUS S551L from windows 8.1 to windows 10. When i open a device manager, only Microsoft Basic Display Adapter showed up but not my Intel graphics card. Then i went online to search on it and people say that windows are unable to
 find the latest driver. So, i went to download the driver for the graphics card but after the installation wizard extract the files and it says-This computer does not meet the minimum requirements for installing the software. I hope that someone could tell
 me a solution to fix this problem.

    <title>Locked out of computer because of BitLocker Recovery Issue, but I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of computer because of BitLocker Recovery Issue, but I NEVER ENABLED BitLocker&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently set up my new Dell PC, which runs on Windows 10. It was running great for an afternoon, but the first time I turned it back on (I had restarted a bunch of times while downloading software with no issues, but this was the first time it had shut
 off entirely), I got the window saying to enter my BitLocker Recovery key. As I never enabled BitLocker, I don't have a recovery key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat, I absolutely did not set up Bitlocker&nbsp;and had no intention of setting up Bitlocker. I ran through the same exact set-up process on a similar computer a few days ago and have not had this BitLocker issue. I did have it attached to a docking station
 when it shut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this BitLocker alert, and because I have no recovery key, I'm locked out of my computer. Dell has provided no help and Microsoft Support said I'd have to create a support ticket (which would cost $400 to handle!!!). Is there any other way around this?
 Has anyone else had this issue before on a Dell Laptop? Am I going to have to reset the entire thing? As I said, I DID NOT enable BitLocker and NEVER set up a BitLocker recovery.&nbsp;</p>

And what might these folder be for which you are getting the UAC pop-up? <br />
And BTW, you should not (nor do you need to) be running a User account that is an Administrator on a daily basis.

                    <p>How do my husband &amp; I change our account settings so that our kids can play our games without having our accounts constantly signed in? I know it's possible. Yes, we have a Family account. Yes, our son's xbox is my husband's "home", while my daughter's is
 my "home". </p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter would like to play some of her father's games with her brother &amp; at the moment she has to have my husband signed in in the background, while she plays with her own account. My husband &amp; I aren't able to use our own accounts if our kids want to
 play our games.</p>

            The Home setting is what allows you to share the games and you can only have 1 console set as your Home at a time. So in order for your daughter to play her father's games, she would either have to play on her brother's console or her father will have
 to sign in. Otherwise, the games would have to be purchased again either on your account or on the kid's accounts.

<p>Hello Mbargie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, what you are trying to do, you will run out of switches for home Xbox quick. You are able to set home console one at a time, what you can do is download both kids profiles onto the kids Xbox's. So for instance
 your daughter wants to play your husbands games she would have to sign in on her brothers Xbox and play. Same with your son wanting to play your games he would have to sign in on your daughters console. There isn't a family or network sharing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a friend in Europe who was going to be away from an online game for awhile (he'd have lost everything he'd worked for), so he let a trusted American friend put his European account on their American
 xbox so the American friend could take care of his game for him. That American friend now has access to all of the European friend's games &amp; could play them if he really wanted to (dissimilar gaming interests besides the common online game he needed help with).
 They are not "family" &amp; don't use each others systems as their "home". <span>
One simply has the other's account on their system, now unused as the European friend is gaming again.

            The only way that would work is if the American friend kept the other account signed in or did set their console as the European's friend Home. Otherwise it was a glitch. Also, you should let them know that sharing account information is a violation of
 the code of conduct so they're putting themselves at risk for being banned.&nbsp;

 playing/buying those games if months or even years of hard work disappeared because they were absolutely unable to play for a week or two.</p>

    <title>Micro stutter while playing games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Micro stutter while playing games</h2>
                    <p>The only game I play is Dark souls 3, which is not a very intensive graphic game. When I start to play, right away, the microstutters starts to happen. It "freezes" microsecond, for every 5 seconds that passes. It's incredibly annoying and ruins the gameplay.
 I heard from other forums that windows 10 sends a large amount of data back to its servers and that is the cause of the micro stutters. So I downloaded the windows tweaker to fix that. It did work a month ago but now with the update that just happened yesterday
 (5/10/16) the stutters will not go away even with the tweak.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Did anyone else find a solution?</p>

<h2>            Photo Gallery and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Have any users&nbsp;- who use Photo Gallery (part of Windows Essentials 2012), preferably on Win 7 - upgraded to Win 10?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you checked out whether Photo Gallery, including all the tags you've attached to your media, continues to operate seamlessly on your
 machine after the Win 10 Upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any problems at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about Movie Maker?&nbsp;&nbsp; I note Microsoft provides contradictory information about compatibility of Movie Maker and Window 10 - see the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) They are NOT compatible according to:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-10/movie-maker-is-not-available-in-windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;They ARE compatible according to:</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Movie%20Maker&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=16&amp;BreadCrumbPath=movie%20maker%20version%2016&amp;LastSearchTerm=movie%2Bmaker%2Bversion%2B16&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%2010</p>

            <p>I downloaded Windows 10 on July 28. I have had nothing but problems . Between 2 and 12 duplicates of many photos. Any duplicate deleted will delete all copies and leave a non removable and non available photo entry. Also renaming or renumbering&nbsp;a photo will
 make it no longer available. Does not effect photos after August. I had about 70,000 photos with windows XP. When I went to Windows 7 pro, it reloaded to 107,000. At least I could delete the duplicates with no problem. When Windows 10 installed, I ended up
 with 307,000 photos. Today I have over 310,000 photos. Totally unmanageable. I do not recommend Windows 10 until they address this problem. I contacted customer service 8/12/2015&nbsp;and was told it caused by a virus and after the virus was removed it would be
 resolved. Not happening! Be very careful. I have lost a lot of photos already. Any change&nbsp;to Collections, &nbsp;Pictures, or Photo Gallery is also done to the others. I will try to resolve this again but will probably return to Windows 7 pro next week.</p>

<p>I assume these "duplicates" are seen in the photo gallery, but the actual photo on your disk is not duplicate. &nbsp;I very much doubt that that the Win 10 upgrade touches you personal files, such as photos.</p>

 &nbsp;How can that happen, when it's THEIR program. &nbsp;Is there any way to fix it? &nbsp;Upgrade it? &nbsp;Or what?

<p>Microsoft compatibility centre says it is compatible. &nbsp;But it says that about moviemaker, and other MS info says Moviemaker is not compatible. &nbsp;See the first post.</p>

<p>Windows 10 full version has officially not been released, will have to wait until the full version is released.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you always can try to install the application in compatibility mode if your application is not compatible with the new operation system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refer to the following Windows 10 FAQ to know about Windows 10:</strong></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail not deleting gmail emails from server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> realdoctorstu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail not deleting gmail emails from server</h2>
                    <p>I know that this is a similar question to ones that have been asked previously, but none of the previous 'fixes' seem to have resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Mail to access my gmail account - and to all intents and purposes it works fine. However, when I log into gmail.com, all my old deleted emails are showing in the inbox. Even when I force a sync in the Mail app, and make sure that the deleted email
 box is emptied, they nevertheless remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that 'deleted' emails in the Mail app are simply being hidden without them actually being removed from the gmail server. What is going on, and how can this be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm having the very same problem, and it's driving me nuts. How can such a basic thing be so broken?? I ended up buying Mailbird as I couldn't stand this situation anymore, it has always been like this since the first version and never got fixed.
</p>
<p>The fact that other email clients are working just fine means it's this one that's doing something wrong.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and googled it, and found this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image you posted actually solved the problem. Choose "Auto-Expunge OFF" to make the next set of choices available. Then choose "Immediately delete the messages forever"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps</p>

                    <p>I know this has been asked and answered previously but the answers provided do not fix my problem. Every time I start the People app it crashes instantly (see below for Event Viewer details). I have tried the Windows Store app troubleshooter. And I have
 tried the following command as Administrator in Powershell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>get-appxpackage *Microsoft.People* | remove-appxpackage</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue. I suggest you to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might
 prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Perform a Clean boot. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

</p><p>I have just spent the best part of three hours with a very helpful Tech Support consultant whose only real option to fix this was to create a new Microsoft profile for me. They gave me instructions on how to copy all elements of my old profile into the new
 account, however this didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was trying to do this a second time, the Windows Apps in the NEW profile started failing (seriously guys, this new profile is less than an hour old).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also just worked out that to re-create my old profile using the new profile is pretty much impossible (won't let me copy over ANY of the files or folders) and I don't know why I am bothering because the Apps are already glitchy on the NEW profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been error reports about this problem since earlier this year. I have rolled over to 10 and now can't roll back to 8, but I now wish I could (and I NEVER thought I'd be saying that). There should be a fix my now. There should be an Update. If
 I stick with the advice provided, it's going to take me another few hours to complete the work that has been suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOU NEED TO FIX THIS (yes, i am very VERY frustrated)</p>

            <p>PS: I have also done everything suggested by the Microsoft tech above, and none of it is solving this issue. I have also tried the two options suggested for this problem by another Support Engineer, but none of them have worked:</p>

 Group and a bug has been created. If not, please do so.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">What is more troubling than the failure itself is the lack of error logging of the failure. Somewhere in the code the error(s) are being swallowed with a try...catch...continue and no logging. That is a very bad practice.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am running Windows 10 (in Developer mode)&nbsp;in a VM on a Mac Mini. A Microsoft Support Engineer is more than welcome to remote into the machine to work on the issue. In fact, I live in Seattle so I can unplug the machine and take
 it over to Campus, Bellevue, or Issaquah (if Support still has a presence up there) for someone to look at.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am not going to do any further debugging on this issue. I plan to do a clean install later this week and I am hoping&nbsp;the People app works on the new install.</p>
