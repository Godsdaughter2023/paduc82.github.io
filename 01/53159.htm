<h2>            Firmware driver broken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is basically brand new (I got it for Christmas 2018.) (IT CAME WITH TONS OF UPDATES THAT NEEDED DOING AND I DOWNLOADED THEM ALL) , I keep having issues with the wireless connection to my wifi even though we have bought boosters for the hope the
 problem will be fixed, didn't do anything. My main problem is my Firmware drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are up to date and I have no system updates. My driver says this -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device cannot start. (Code 10)</p>
<p>Indicates a revision number encountered or specified is not one known by the service. It may be a more recent revision than the service is aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sister has the same laptop in the 14.4" version with the specs not as good, yet hers has a higher performance then mine no matter what I do, games and certain things are blurry, where hers works the way I would expect mine to.</p>

            Hi Millie, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It's possible it's an issue with your WiFi adapter itself, perhaps a manufacturing fault which might need to be repaired by the manufacturer.
<br />
<br />However, if it's a software issue, you can try the below steps to troubleshoot. Firstly, see if reinstalling the drivers through Device Manager helps:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your WiFi adapter in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Once you've tried this, if it doesn't work you could try downloading and installing the manufacturer's drivers. If you're able to let me know what brand and model your laptop is, I can help you find the right drivers.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

            <p>Hi Francis,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sleeping computer awakens quicker than if you set the same machine set to hibernate. The price to pay is that a sleeping computer could lose unsaved data if someone turns it off, this is because the information is stored in RAM, which is cleared if the
 operating system powers down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although a hibernating machine takes longer to return to its previous state, the data is safe because it reloads the contents of a physical file called hiberfil.sys into memory. Consequently, if someone accidentally turned off your machine while it was hibernating
 your data would still be just as you left it. Another benefit of hibernation is that it consumes less power than sleep mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot download anything while your computer is in Sleep or Hibernate state.

    <title>1803 RUINED my computer completely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vu407  say:</h3>
<h2>            1803 RUINED my computer completely</h2>
                    <p>Many of my friends had told me about some new Windows update that crashed their laptops so I knew better and tried not to let the update happened on my computer. I kept delay it with "snooze" and "wait"... until one morning I woke up and it was a blue screen
 asking me to choose keyboard layout (US or whatever) so I knew I screwed, just unsure of how bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose US then it took me to another blue screen that has "Windows Rollback" and other options. I chose the first one available, and it went to restart and back to the blue keyboard screen. I chose the next option after Windows Rollback and it showed 3
 options, one to go back to previous version and 2 to go to the updated versions. I chose to go back,&nbsp; it wouldn't let me. There was no going back, couldn't restore... So I had to go ahead with the updated version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gave me the 'sihost.exe System Warning - Unknown hard error'. I clicked ok. Then log in and my screen was blank with the unresponsive taskbar. It said 'windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop is unavailable'. I had to do ctrl+alt+del to get something
 to come up, and that was the only way i could choose restart without hot power off. And restart would simply take me back to the blue keyboard layout screen all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying for half a day, I researched with my phone and found some suggestions including the cmd.exe and none would change anything. Finally I came across one that seemed desperate last resort (short of format the hdd and reinstall win10 completely,
 as that would mean lose my files), and that was to turn on and off with power button a few times to bring up Recovery to do a Reset. I chose 'save my files' and proceed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen was black and it slowly counted up 1%... I figured it would take a while so I went to do some work. 2 hours later came back and it was on the Lenovo logo screen (very first screen to comes on normally when I turn on the computer, before anything
 else kicks in). So i walked away and 10 minutes later came back,&nbsp; it was still on that screen. Another hour went by and it was still on the same screen. I left it on over night and the next morning it was still that same screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit different keys but the keyboard was not responding (even when I hit Caplock or Numlock, those light would not turn on), and the mouse was useless too. I tried restart many times with all the F from F2 and F10 and F12 and F everything in between but
 nothing changed. I simply could not get to BIOS screen or BOOT menu or RECOVERY or anything at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More research on the phone suggested that it could be a no POST issue and told me to open the computer up to check hardware. When i removed RAM and powered up, it didn't show Lenovo logo screen, just blank. When I removed hdd and powered up,&nbsp; it said 'no
 OS'. Nothing else seemed to make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to Geeksquad to see if they had any suggestion. The guy told me $200 for them to TRY but no promise they can retrieve my data, and likely they will have to format the hdd and install fresh win10 if the hdd isn't damaged. Otherwise I have to buy
 a new hdd on top of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would like to say that this is unacceptable. I am a Windows fan, and don't bother with Mac. I know Windows has small glitches and usually has small issues with most new updates. That's why I typically don't like to install any updates until 6 months
 later, and I can live with that. So Windows needs to stop taking lesson from Mac or copy cat Mac with the big updates yearly and screw up royally, and force update. MY COMPUTER WAS RUNNING JUST FINE UNTIL THIS FORCE UPDATE. So let me decide when I want to
 update my computer, give me control of my stuff, it's why I like Windows in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Horizon 2 27. I bought it about 2 years ago brand new at BestBuy. It had win8,&nbsp; and I free upgraded it to win10. It has no CD drive and I don't have any serial number or keycode for any Windows. I never looked for it since it already had
 win8 and running just fine. Now if i have to format hdd, I don't know how to install win10 back on without CD drive and without having to pay for win10. THIS IS SO MESS UP</p>

<p>Easiest way to get back up and functional is to do this.&nbsp; It won't cost a penny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Go to any other Windows computer and go to the Windows 10 download page to download the Media Creator Tool, which will let you create your own Windows 10 install disc or USB thumb drive stick (your choice).</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Run the tool and create your stick or disc.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Plug the install drive into the broken computer and reboot and install Windows directly. This will take about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>In my case, since I can't get pass the Lenovo logo screen (very first screen when I turn the computer on before anything else would take place), and no response from keyboard or mouse, and no CD drive. I would like to ask:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ How would this usb install work? Do I just plug it in and it would automatically run and get pass the Lenovo screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ What about all my important data? How can I save those?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1)&nbsp; Yes it will.&nbsp; This is what any repair shop or geek squad would do for you (except you can do it yourself for free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; The best thing would be to get it from whatever your normal backup is (whatever you'd do if your computer got hit by a power surge/lightning strike, burned in a house fire, got dropped on the sidewalk, or had the hard drive die out).&nbsp; But if you never
 made a backup, there's alternatives too.&nbsp; For example, after you boot from the install drive, you can press Shift+F10 to open a command prompt and tell it to copy your files to your USB stick for safe keeping.</p>

<p>I never made any backup (dumb of me I know, always meant to do it but never got around to it). And the usb won't hold about 500GB. Can i plug another external hdd in a different usb port and copy it that way? And what command do i type in after Shift+F10?
 I haven't touched DOS commands in about 20 years except for once or twice where I just copy whatever people type in the suggestion.</p>

<p>From the Finger Wagging Department: If only you were backing up every day (making an image backup of your C: drive,) which is so easy to do once you know how, your 'disaster' would be completely reversible in a matter of minutes and your computer would go
 back in time to before the feature update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if you have the Professional Edition of Windows 10, you sign in to an Administrator account and delay the upgrade for as long as a year (I chose 90 days) which gives you time to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the Home edition, congratulations: You're a Microsoft beta tester.</p>

<p>For the most part it's pretty easy to use the command prompt.&nbsp; But someone told me this trick (that I admit I haven't tried yet, but it sounds awesome):&nbsp; just type notepad.exe at the command prompt, go to File/Open, and use that dialog box as if it was a
 file explorer interface to copy/paste files between the internal drive and your backup drive/USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible to just install Windows again "on top of itself" (commonly called a "repair install" or "in-place-upgrade"), and it could repair the issue without losing any data -- but it's better to make a copy of what you need first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I test out a ton of stuff constantly, but by storing all my files in OneDrive, I'm never more than a half-hour away from fixing my computer.&nbsp; I just run a quick factory reset (15 minutes) and then reinstall my favorite browser (Chrome) and Office and a few
 things (another 10 minutes or so), and all my files are still in OneDrive like they never left.&nbsp; Works great for when I get a new computer too, since that's basically the same process.&nbsp; I even borked up a computer during a trip and did this at a hotel a few
 weeks ago.&nbsp; I could drop my computer in a lake and be back up like nothing happened within a half hour.&nbsp; And that's not a OneDrive plug -- you could do the same with Google Drive, DropBox, Box, Amazon, iCloud, Carbonite, Norton, or any other online storage
 service.&nbsp; There's no need to ever lose a thing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I also like to store my work in OneDrive (among other places) and I separate my software and local data into separate partitions which are backed up independently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally prefer to make and restore image backups, because I can do that in less than 10 minutes. I can do that even if my computer is messed up (which I have done more often than I care to admit) or doesn't boot (yeah, that too,) and I can restore to
 different hardware or to a virtual machine, if need be. The advantage of restoring a backup is that there's nothing that needs to be re-installed or updated, and no need to setup my computer again because it already looks and works exactly as I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantage of your method, as I see it, is that you give yourself a fresh start every time. That gives users an opportunity to reconsider their settings and preferences. That's something I may do for v.1803 since I've been upgrading ever since the RTM.</p>

I had the same problem and it took a while to even get to the sign in page so I could start in Safe Mode and use system restore with network. Support.microsoft.com/safemode has the answer. I used my phone to access the information and recover my desktop. What
 is this program anyway? I have auto update and shouldn't have to deal with this.&nbsp;

<p>Every time I could only use get to safe boot through the boot error -repairing unsuccessful restart or choose Recover-Restore-get firmware-command prompt- advanced options, and all the other options.&nbsp; The safe mode option failed to enter safe more-due BAD
 SYSTEM CONFIG. Loop.&nbsp; I tried to restore from a restore point of 8/17 which also was the first one I thought preceded the problem and it went through the restore routine&nbsp;and said it completed, re-booted and Stop Code appears again.&nbsp; Recover failed because
 there was no image found, though it could find it on the DVD&nbsp;or hard drive and also know a file calling&nbsp;itself the windows file exists on both. Using the command prompt and following the /fixboot&nbsp;method I ran into Access Denied return when executed. I tried
 variations listed here and it would not complete.&nbsp; CMD and Shell won't load say not enough memory if it would I know I can get some.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to ReInstall saving files and apps and it rejected that without thinking about it.&nbsp; So I went with Reinstall Windows 10 Pro again, using the same USB PE I did the original install with (only one I had). I could not make another because can't get
 into windows to use the&nbsp;media creation&nbsp;tool.&nbsp; I have no physical disk; my new windows pro only came as a digital download with the necessary license key.&nbsp; So I installed the whole thing again, and after that I restarted, and Stop Code Bad System Config&nbsp;pops
 up again and starts the loop again.&nbsp; I ran chkdsk&nbsp;again and forced it to dismount to run on itself&nbsp;(PE) then&nbsp;on C (actually D, the USB became C). It did not show any errors but didn't finish either.&nbsp; I reran it and, it did complete.&nbsp; The Reserved Partition&nbsp;is
 toast (lost Partition) and I ran Recovery software, and the data files are there, but there are unusable as they are.&nbsp; So here is what I need to know, if the system is functioning presumably fine except the Reserve Partition, how do I fix just that piece to
 be useable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scenario has hit 2 systems completely different installs (not even networked), and the only thing they have in common was it updated to the most recent push to 1803.somethiing, and the other is brand new, and 1803 was its very first operating system.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I have friends and family who are dealing with the same general problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;There has to be a suspect and a solve?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have laid it all out because different pieces show up all over but nothing so far as I can find address the LOOP.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

<h2>            TV Set Top Box not detected by windows &#40;7&#41;, when connected via HDMI Cable to the PC</h2>
                    <div>Dear Sirs, thank you for the prompt reply. I tried both the methods but to no avail. I shall rephrase&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my question as,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "TV Set Top Box not detected by windows (7), when connected via HDMI Cable to the PC".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please find the System information as required by you:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>TV - SONY Flatron 24" Model</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>TataSky Set top Box - Has provision for recording and storing the TV Programs and is provided with&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>500GB HDD, supplementary HDMI(with 1 meter cable), Ethernet(with USB cable) and USB 2.0 sockets.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Computer - DELL Inspiron 501S, Intel i3, 4GB Memory, 3.2MHz processor with 2 HDMI and 2 VGA ports. I &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>have a 1TB Seagate External HDD connected to my PC. The Monitor is DELL 22" LED with 2 VGA ports.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HDMI Cables - 1 meter cable provided by TataSky, 5 meter Belkin Cable with Ethernet purchased by me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Set top Box to PC connection via HDMI Cable(either cable) - When thus connected, Windows(7) does not&nbsp;</div>
<div>detect the Device. Detection search prolonged even for 1 hour.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since, HDMI ports are provided and cables supplied for both the Set top box and the PC, the connection should&nbsp;</div>
<div>work. My PC instantly detects other devices like external HDD, printer, scanner, cellphone etc., it should as well&nbsp;</div>
<div>detect the settop box supposed to be onnected via the HDMI ports, unless additional action needs to be taken&nbsp;</div>
<div>and about which, I am not aware. I have also attempted to simulteneously replace the Internet Broadband&nbsp;</div>
<div>Modem(D-Link GLB-502T) connection with the set top box ethernet connection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise and guide. Thank and regards.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Shiv.</div>

            <p>Both of these HDMI ports will be outputs to connect an external monitor/TV to. Neither can accept a signal in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be possible access the TataSky box via Ethernet as&nbsp;a network device, you cannot connect them together with USB as again they are both master devices. This is why USB has different connectors on either end with the A end in the master, external drives,
 scanners, printers are slave devices and have the B connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network devices can only be connected together with a crossover cable, you would normally interconnect them with a network switch which does the crossover for you.</p>

    <title>USB Ports, Biometric device and webcam not working in Windows 8 after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kapil rakh  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Ports, Biometric device and webcam not working in Windows 8 after uninstalling a AT&#38;T software</h2>
                    <p>
I had installed a VPN software some time ago. After I uninstalled that, my USB connections, the fingerprint reader and webcam stopped working. USB connections include memory stick, mouse, keyboard.</p>
<p>
The behavior of USB connections is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Phone : Gets charged but can't browse files.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Wired Mouse : The LED turns on but the device doesn't get recognized.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Microsoft Keyboard : I can see a light on NumLock as soon as I plugin USB. But the LED turns off right away.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
webcam : Does not get detected by YouLink Webcam software.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
The solution that worked for me was to restore to the point where this VPN software was installed. I don't need that software anymore.</p>
<p>
The device manager device detection doesn't show any changes. Restart didn't help. No error messages in the event log related to these problems.</p>
<p>
The VPN software is from AT&amp;T that I had used for work.</p>
<p>
This is a HP Windows 8 laptop</p>
<p>
And now I found that the HDMI port stopped working all of a sudden.</p>
<p>
Please help.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro power cable design flaw</h2>
                    <p>It is now the second time my power cable breaks, just below the connector. This is clearly a design flaw and form it has happened two times&nbsp; and a replacement should be within warranty.&nbsp; I do not get the option to claim that this is a product fault, when
 adding a service request. Microsoft has closed its homepages and contact points for any claims related to product quality and I woudl have to use "accidental Dammage" which this is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add your comments to this post if you have had similar experience with the cable This cable design has been in use for many years so having a charger cable lifetime of only one year should be known issue. Microsoft is keeping the design to charge extra or
 to make us use the insurance and other repairs for known cable issues.</p>

            I have had problems with the surface never the cord. Now that I get my surface fixed now there's a freaking short in my cord and I am pretty sure it is not covered under warranty because of the fact its 2 years old. So annoying these cords are so expensive.....

<p>Hi arifchan2003,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>a. Have you tried using different DVDs and checked?</p>
<p>I’d suggest you to put your computer in clean boot state and try performing a system image backup and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may go ahead and disable or uninstall the same.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</p>
<p>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>The above steps would put the computer in clean boot state. Try to do a full system image backup now and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more details:</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a></p>
<p>After you’ve finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, you may also check your drives for any errors.</p>
<p>You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for details:</p>
<p><strong>Check a drive for errors<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</strong></a></p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Need to UPGRADE Win 7 Pro X 64 to Win 10 Pro X 64</h2>
                    <p>Upgrading Win 7 Pro to Win 10 Pro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Win 7 Pro with Service Pak 1 on a HP PC Desktop Mo h8-1360t 1.00 and I want to upgrade (not a fresh install) upgrade Win 7 Pro 64 bit to Win 10 Pro. 64 Bit</p>
<p>Spec: Processor is Intel (R) Quad Core I-7-3770CPU 3.4 GHZ, 10 GB Mem , Hard Drive (C) 911 GB tot 787 Free and Hard Drive (E) 500 GB 415 Free Used for storage,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win 7 OS is Activated and with Genuine Microsoft Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is when I upgrade 7 to 10 will the upgrade process keep the same mapping &nbsp;for all of my drives. I have a C drive with the OS installed here and also a E drive with a 500 GB HD disk internal, I use for storage. Here is all of the mapping I see:
<em>I have two hard drives in this PC.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>(C) <em>OS HD</em></p>
<p>(D) Recovery </p>
<p>(E) <em>Internal HD For Storage</em></p>
<p>(E) DVD</p>
<p>(F) DVD</p>
<p>(I) (J) (k) (L) Removable Disk (not sure what this is for)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I'm just not sure if the upgrade will change, or not,&nbsp;the way my system is currently set up.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 for emerging markets</h2>
                    I bought Windows 8 ( produced in Turkey , made for emerging markets) in specialised shop in Serbia before one month. I couldn't activate it down there for some reason, and in meantime I came to Norway where I shall stay for one year. When I wanted to do
 that here , I got message that this product is not made for this country. Is it possible to activate that Windows in Norway or I need to buy full version for this market?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Mauricio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear this is happening buddy. Have you had this happen before with any other controllers, or have you tried to use any other controller with your Xbox?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since most steps were performed to troubleshoot w<span><span>e suggest (if it hasn't already been done) a reset of the console
</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ince
</span></span><span><span>the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a

 Factory Reset</span></span></span></a><span><span>(while keeping games and apps)
</span></span><span><span>Before resetting your console make sure of the following:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>There is a stable network connection.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>The information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup
 let's do </span></span><span><span>manual setup</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;uninstalled and reinstalled the new version and problem still occurs. The contact who im&nbsp;trying to send messages to has done the same thing and still no luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 100&#37; disk usage</h2>
                    <p>Disk usage sits at 100% since upgrading to windows 10 from 7. Seems to be a fairly common issue online but none of the online solutions have helped. Here's some of what I've tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Disabled windows defender<br />
Disabled "windows search" service<br />
Stopped lots of services from starting on startup<br />
Disabled superfetch and prefetch&nbsp;<br />
Forced a full disk check<br />
Reset virtual memory<br />
Altered paging file size<br />
Updated all drivers<br />
Disabled message signal interrupt mode&nbsp;<br />
Turned off "show me tips about windows"<br />
Some other registry stuff that I can't remember<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            I know this is obvious, but just checking... what windows version are you on? (type
<strong>winver </strong>in search); if its not 1607 you need to upgrade.&nbsp; And put paging config back to default.&nbsp; And you won't like this one - have you clean installed at any time since upgrading from 7?

<h2>            Infinity 3.0 freezing issue</h2>
                    <p>I bought the 3.0 digital download last night. When I goto the hall of heroes it freezes. It does the same thing on both my Xbox 360. I have the slim model for both. I originally had issues with the disc but bought the digital version in case the disc was the problem. I either want this fixed or a refund.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>My Surface Pro 3 has randomly started asking for the Bitlocker pass key every time it starts up. I have never set up Bitlocker so not sure why this has just started happening. Please can someone inform me how to stop this being prompted? It is incredibly
 frustrating to keep typing this key in every time!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I believe it started happening after Windows did an update.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same issue with my surface pro 3. Luckily I had my code saved off of my computer so I have been able to log back in to my computer. When ever I restart or have my computer go into hibernation it asks for the code again. I have not made
 any changes to my settings before this starting happening. The only thing that was different was that my computer was completely dead when I restarted it. Once it began the start sequence, after being completely dead, it started asking for my bitlocker code.
 I've read from past complaints about this issue that turning off bitlocker and then restarting. Log back in and re-enabling bitlocker will stop this problem. The only thing that keeps me from doing this is a prompt I've stated getting, on occasion, when restarting,
 that says I have some kind of memory issue. Unfortunately my computer restarts before I can read the error code in time.

<p>
</p><p>The only thing ive found helpful is to suspend bitlocker (leaving your dive un-encrypted). This kept me from having to enter the key every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I found helpful and have not attempted yet is to create a TPM with access code on USB.</p>

    <title>Possible solution to Windows 10 Activation problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrpreview  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible solution to Windows 10 Activation problem</h2>
                    <p>Suffice to say my clean install of the Windows 10 Insider Preview (on an old Windows 7 Toshiba laptop) updated itself to the final version of Windows 10, and I now see a message about needing an activation key.</p>
<p>The Windows 7 key from the laptop does not work because (after some research, I learn that) it needs a Windows 10 key.</p>
<p>I really don't want to restore my Windows 7 back onto the laptop </p>
<p>(yes, I do have an Acronis TrueImage backup of the Windows 7 image I could restore; ya didn't think I'd trust anything else, did ya? :)</p>
<p>to do the Windows 10 setup/upgrade thing, so how about...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft offering a web-based application, that when you enter a Windows 7 or 8 key, it gives you a corresponding Windows 10 key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, we could all just enter this new Windows 10 key into the activation window and get a new, squeaky clean Windows 10 setup, and not have to restore an old OS with too much junk in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts?</p>

            <p>hello MrPreview ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: looks like Microsoft is finally going your way. read this article <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/10/13/microsoft-windows-10-new-upgrade-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/10/13/microsoft-windows-10-new-upgrade-rules/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can be wrong about my knowledge as I am not a windows insider but I did read the Microsoft statements on various forums about the license rules to a windows insider. there is no denying that Microsoft has been oscillating a bit as to what to do to the
 insiders. But do you really&nbsp;think that&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;will do anything like&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Microsoft offering a web-based application, that when you enter a Windows 7 or 8 key, it gives you a corresponding Windows 10 key?&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why I think Microsoft will not do that? I think so because of the windows software license method of the windows 7 and 8. for example some OEM keys in preinstalled softwares&nbsp;(though we can't know the key as it sits in bios) has in fact a single key to install
 it on hundreds of manufacturers laptops or tabs or whatever. So I guess it won't be easy for Microsoft to give a unique key to the users of these systems. so they did the hard ware identity method which is the easiest and more reliable. And it can be applied
 for every one. what about the retail versions sold on dvds and usbs? well I think we can find the solution on the terms of windows 10 upgrade offer. It says that it gives the license free for the supported life time of the
<strong>device. </strong>so its actually restricting the user from using it on more than one PC on which he runs his genuine software. Like a user with a copy of windows 7 to use it on one PC at any point of time, then after upgrade&nbsp;to windows 10&nbsp;we can use
 the media of windows 7&nbsp;with license key&nbsp;on only the PC on which we have our entitled windows 10. So I guess Microsoft is playing really&nbsp;smart this time to protect piracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that you clean&nbsp;Installed the windows 10 insider preview and then it automatically updated to the latest build on official release (probably 10240). but after that Microsoft clarified its statement various times asking the user to not&nbsp;to look at the
 insider program as a means to get access to windows 10 for free. Users in insider program having genuine windows versions should first revert back to those versions then upgrade like every one else and then opt out to get insider builds . I guess doing this
 is safe and does not ask for activation code and also we can signout any time from insider preview and uninstall previews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess since you are running the clean install of preview build software then you would indeed be running the limited timed version of preview build. so Microsoft said that it would not close the insider program any time soon but still direct windows
 insider previewers does have limited timed OS till the next build comes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess if you never upgraded from a genuine version of previous OS i.e. windows 7 but only upgraded from a clean installed windows preview then it is obvious that the OS would be timed. I never used insider program but I have an option just like every
 other windows 10 in settings to opt for preview builds and become insiders. And more over right now only genuinely updated windows 10 users are allowed to become windows 10 insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think if you reinstall your genuine&nbsp; 7 back and then upgrade from there, then may be you could solve your license issues. then you can opt for preview builds.</p>
<p>

            <div>It appears Microsoft already has an online mechanism for validating the key.<br />

or restore using Acronis TrueImage (will include all the junk in the registry that accumulated over the years),

<p>Suffice to say my clean install of the Windows 10 Insider Preview (on an old Windows 7 Toshiba laptop) updated itself to the final version of Windows 10, and I now see a message about needing an activation key.</p>
<p>The Windows 7 key from the laptop does not work because (after some research, I learn that) it needs a Windows 10 key.</p>
<p>I really don't want to restore my Windows 7 back onto the laptop </p>
<p>(yes, I do have an Acronis TrueImage backup of the Windows 7 image I could restore; ya didn't think I'd trust anything else, did ya? :)</p>
<p>to do the Windows 10 setup/upgrade thing, so how about...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft offering a web-based application, that when you enter a Windows 7 or 8 key, it gives you a corresponding Windows 10 key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, we could all just enter this new Windows 10 key into the activation window and get a new, squeaky clean Windows 10 setup, and not have to restore an old OS with too much junk in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Microsoft just isn't going to do that, because it means they would be issuing the vast majority of users who only have a non-transferrable OEM product delivered with their PC/Laptop with a fully transferrable Retail Product Key. &nbsp;That would be an inconceivable
 business decision.</p>

<p>That should save some people the additional work.</p>
<p>A move in the right direction by Microsoft, no doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up restoring the old Windows 7 and upgrading to Windows 10. It was a slow process, since Windows 7 was not running on that old laptop for about a year.</p>

    <title>Way to use old HDD with a transfer cable on a Slim&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rev apoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Way to use old HDD with a transfer cable on a Slim&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I went to Gamestop to buy a new 360 because my wife's has been acting up.&nbsp; We had just purchsed the 120gb for her old one, and&nbsp;the guy at the store said that as long as I didn't mind the old HDD just laying around,&nbsp;I could buy the transfer cable and hook&nbsp;up
 the old HDD to the transfer cable, plug it into a USB port on the slim, and just run everything off of the old HDD, as if it were the main HDD.&nbsp; I have not found that to be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system recognizes the memory from the HDD through the transfer cable while on the dashboard menus, and will even run an installed 360 game off of the old HDD and not from the disc, but it won't recognize anything else while in game.&nbsp; No save files or
 anything like that.&nbsp; And if I try to install anything or play anything it only brings up the internal memory as an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look up the "information" for the old HDD, labeled as "Transfer Cable", it says that the remaining memory is reserved for&nbsp;system use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is what the guy said at the store even possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help&nbsp;would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p><em>No the guy at the store lied to you, the cable can be used to transfer data to a new HDD but as far as I know that is it. I'm not saying it is not possible but I have never heard of this as something you can actually do so either its never come up before
 or it can not be done. I would go with the latter if I had money on it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You would need a HDD for your slim, then you can transfer the data to&nbsp;its 250GB HDD&nbsp;using the cable while its attached to your old 120GB HDD.</em></p>

<p>After a few hours last night of troubleshooting, trying all kinds of things, and not seeing 1 word in regards to it on the forums, I figured this was the case.</p>
<p>I really hope returning the 4gb to get the 250gb isn't an issue at Gamestop. &nbsp;I'll keep the cable for the transfer, but they better let me do the exchange.</p>

    <title>Pioneer VSX-523-K - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gr0ki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pioneer VSX-523-K</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded my analog receiver with an HDMI receiver, a Pioneer VSC-523-K. &nbsp;I was able to get the picture and sound working properly. &nbsp;I am running into trouble getting the XBox one to send remote signals to the receiver.</p>
<p>My Pioneer remote has a model number AXD7690. &nbsp;When I go into the device settings and set up the new Pioneer receive I am able to do the wizard that sets up the remote. &nbsp;During this wizard the Xbox One is able to turn the volume up and mute the receiver.
 &nbsp;It then says it is finished and it says it is using code R2743. &nbsp;I exit out of the screen, but the volume up/down/mute do not work on my XBox one remote control. &nbsp;If I set the XBox One to send 'off' or 'on' commands to the receiver at the XBox start up or
 shut down... that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>I am not able to find a list of XBox One remote codes for Pioneer to try. &nbsp;I have tried variations in the wizard and saying 'no' that the volume or mute did not engage when it truly did trying to get a different remote code other than R2743. &nbsp;I haven't been
 able to find anything that worked past this first option.</p>
<p>I have a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What code should I use for this receiver? </li><li>Is there a list of available codes used by the XBox One? </li><li>Is there any cross map of Panasonic remote codes (AXD7690) to XBox One Codes (????)
</li><li>Any other steps I can take to get this to work? </li></ul>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to review my issue and thank you in advance for any help you can provide.</p>

    <title>Add Printer Wizard Never Finds Network Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomtt2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add Printer Wizard Never Finds Network Printer</h2>
                    <p>I have a home wireless network with three computers and one printer on the network.</p>
<p>Two machines run Window XP Pro SP3 and One machine runs Windows 10.</p>
<p>The printer is the Brother MFC-J430W.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network was set up four or five years ago and each PC is able to print wirelessly from the Brother printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Problem: When I use the "Add Printer" wizard and select "Network Printer" and "Brows for Printer" the wizard just sits there, never completing the search or displaying anything. There is no error message. It just sits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I can use the printer without problems. </p>
<p>I accessed the router control panel and confirmed that the printer is listed on the client list.</p>
<p>I turned off the firewall in the router and on my PC.</p>
<p>I tried a second router. One that I used in the past. I added a PC and the printer to the router's network, then tried to add printer. No results. The wizard just sits there when you try to browse to network printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, the printer is not found. The same problem with every PC, including the Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried multiple computers, multiple operating systems, multiple routers. In no combination is the printer detected by the Add Printer Wizard. The printer works with the existing computers, so I tend to rule out the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another PC I would like to add to the network and print from, but if I can't detect the printer, I can't add it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I'm missing?</p>
<p>

    <title>Simultaneous pen and touch input - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beesperester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Simultaneous pen and touch input</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if it is possible to simultaneously use the stylus and touch input. Like for example drawing with the stylus in one hand while pressing on screen buttons with the other hand. Right now it seems to reject the touch input when the tip of the
 pen is on the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can easily be reproduced: Create a new document on your desktop, you can select and deselect it with a touch of a finger. Now put the pen on the surface and you are not able to select / deselect the document anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature would be super useful, when using an on screen radial menu and buttons while working in applications like zBrush and Photoshop.</p>
