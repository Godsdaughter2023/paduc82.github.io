                    <p>I am operating windows 10 not yet 3 months old. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just on the internet and got a pop up box that I could not get out of.&nbsp; "YOUR MICROSOFT COMPUTER HAS BEEN BLOCKED!!"&nbsp;Window System Alert!! System has been infected due to unexpected error!&nbsp; Pleas Contact Microsoft Technical Support1-844-825-2785 to

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I certainly understand your concern.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to try the methods given below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To diagnose the problem whether any third party program or application is causing the conflict, I would suggest you to try “clean boot” and check if it helps.

    <title>APN settings via Windows Configuration Designer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuley eldar  say:</h3>
<h2>            APN settings via Windows Configuration Designer</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our company we use Lenovo laptops, with windown 10 and a built in Sierra cellular modem.</p>
<p>we are about to start working with a new SIM card operator that requires a special APN, and we do not want our users to manually enter the APN, but looking for a simpler method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tries setting a profile with the Windows Configuration Designer, and have a few issues with it</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We are not sure if the correct field to use is the "cellular" or the "EnterpriseAPN". What are the differences between them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. We tested one profile we created on one of the computers. Right after adding the provisioning package the APN was changed to "Admin APN", without the option to set a different one.&nbsp;<br />
After a power cycle (shut down) the Admin APN was shown as one of the options on the default APN list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. we tried to remove the provisioning package, but the Admin APN is still present in the settings. How can we remove it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone is able to help with these settings? I could not find a decent manual to refer to either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as there this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. On Technet, even Microsoft Product team will look into your issue.

            <p>You can't connect to a Windows Home Edition computer using remote desktop. &nbsp;The computer you're remoting into (the "remote" PC) needs to be running Windows Pro edition to allow it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could upgrade, but honestly with the work it takes to forward the ports and packets, my personal recommendation is to use a free program like Team Viewer instead. &nbsp;It's free and works on Home edition computers.<br />

            It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            Thanks for replying.. Yeah, that's one of the options that I'm probably going to be doing. But the problem is, I've had this issue with the past version of Win 10. I'll try to do all possible solutions first then if nothing works, I'll just revert it back.
 Thanks again!

<p>You're welcome for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately since the recent Windows updates can only obtain only basic information from the dump files due to lack of symbol support for the recent updates&nbsp;from the Microsoft symbol server which are needed to properly debug the errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the original reference to the netio.sys suggests the error is from a&nbsp;network related driver&nbsp;such as a third party antivirus, firewall or VPN driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several such drivers on the system - Avast drivers, Malwarebytes drivers, and the vsdatant.sys (ZoneAlarm driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is ZoneAlarm installed or Check Point VPN? If so, what version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Malwarebytes installed? If&nbsp;so, are you using a paid version and what version is installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Avast is installed?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have Malwarebytes installed before but I've uninstalled it back in February (or early March I think..). I don't have Checkpoint VPN but I do have Cyberghost VPN which I rarely use. I can't remember an instance where I was using Cyberghost and my system
 crashed though. Below's the screenshot for both the Avast's and ZoneAlarm's software version. I do regularly update both of them.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I do have Windows Defender turned on. Could an incompatibility issue between those softwares be the cause of the crash.&nbsp;<br />

<p>There are a couple of Malwarebytes drivers loaded on the system that appear to be left over from the Malwarebytes installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you download and run&nbsp;the uninstall tool in the following link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also try updating ZoneAlarm to the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue, though, may be with an&nbsp;Avast driver(s)&nbsp;or with a conflict between Avast driver(s) and another driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the errors persists you could try a previous version of Avast that worked without issue.</p>

            I've already updated ZoneAlarm last night. I guess it wasn't updating automatically. Should I continue running ZoneAlarm/Avast or just stick with Windows Defender?<br />

I ran the Uninstall app for MalwareBytes and this is what I got.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I don't know if I can revert back to a previous version of Avast since I did experience bsod's since I installed it when &nbsp;I got my laptop last December. Any anti-virus recommendation besides Avast? I'm thinking of uninstalling it just to see if it really
 is the problem.&nbsp;<br />

<p>If you have not recently received a&nbsp;crash then you could leave things as they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a crash reoccurs then you could uninstall Avast and ZoneAlarm and use Windows Defender and Windows firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes, the latest version,&nbsp;could be reinstalled for on-demand scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do reinstall Malwarebytes make sure that the free version is the selected version to avoid driver conflicts.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 won&#39;t activate after hardware change and reinstallation.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed motherboard and had to reactivate Windows, so i did. That motherboard turned out to be defective so was replaced. At the same time i decided to move to a new SSD and reinstall fresh. During the install i selected skip when asked for the
 product key and then logged into my account at the end of the installation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it won't activate. I've gone through all the motions: Activate &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Hardware change &gt; Log in. And it comes back saying it can't find any devices linked to my Microsoft account that can be used to reactivate Windows, which shouldn't be
 so since logging into my account here i can see the activated device i was using some hours ago (see screenshot -&nbsp;https://i.imgur.com/l5FuynS.png - the bottom one is the activated version). I've also somehow added this installation as a second device when
 i didn't mean to. I'm hesitant to remove the other device since that's the activated one and then i'll have no record of an activation, but should i do so?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been clicking around for a while trying anything that seems like a fix but have failed. I'm not sure what else to do save for post on a forum asking for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>The devices are listed in your account as managed devices, but it doesn't mean they are transferable licenses. Depending on how Windows 10 was configured on your computer, transferring to a new motherboard might have invalidated the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</span></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that
 licensing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Full version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Upgrade version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>OEM :</span></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens if I change my motherboard?</span></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>OEM license&nbsp;</span>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase
 a full retail Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<span>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><span>b. Stand-alone software.</span>&nbsp;If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you.
 You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the
 software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I should have been clearer and mentioned that i have a retail license from 8.1, which was on a different computer initially. I upgraded to 10 on that computer. I then changed computer (to this one), and activated Windows. I then
 replaced the faulty motherboard. Windows was still activated and working on the new motherboard. When i was satisfied that no hardware was faulty anymore (last night), i installed Win 10 on this new hard drive. I am now where i am with being unable to activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i put the other SSD in (the one with previous install of Windows), it works fine and is activated (on this same hardware). If i put this SSD in (the new installation of Windows), it won't activate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been able to find 2 different error codes when going through the activation steps. There's 0x803f7001, which means they didn’t find a valid Windows license for your PC, which doesn't make sense because this is the same PC i was using yesterday and for
 the past couple of weeks (save for this new SSD) with an activated license. The second error code is 0XC004E016 which means this install is not the same as the one that my license is for, which is incorrect because my license is for Win Home and this install
 is Win Home. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that it's this: If you upgraded from a retail copy of Windows 7, Windows 8 or 8.1, the Windows 10 license carries the retail rights from which it was derived –
<strong>can be transferred</strong>. But under Microsoft’s rules, you are only entitled to a one time transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and it's seeing this new install as a second transfer but it shouldn't as it's the same transfer but i just had a faulty motherboard and wanted a fresh install for the new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to speak to Microsoft directly? Can't seem to find a way as all support links just take me to a forum.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft fixed it for me in the end by granting a new product key as they weren't able to activate it with remote assistance either.

    <title>Task Scheduler won&#39;t display &#34;All running tasks&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zuhl3156  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler won&#39;t display &#34;All running tasks&#34;</h2>
                    Every morning for the past few days when I go to check "All running tasks" in Task Scheduler, the tasks are displayed but their status says 'unavailable'. After I reboot it works normally. SFC shows no errors. I first noticed this problem after a game
 required ASP.NET 4.0 extended version to be installed. After the installation of ASP.NET 4.0 extended I had several Windows Updates download and install.Before I removed ASP.NET 4.0 extended I couldn't get "All runing tasks" to display no matter what I did.
 Should I remove the installed Updates too? My AV/AS is AVG 2012. Windows 7 was re-installed less than three weeks ago. This is causing no major or minor system issues but it is still annoying to me. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Zuhl3156,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sorry to know that you are facing issue with Task Scheduler not displaying all running tasks. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply
 to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware,
 and other malicious software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
 It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions,
 download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on
 that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> If that does not work, create a new user account and check. If it works in a new user account, then probably your user account
 may have been corrupted and would need a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Create a user profile.</b></p>

            Thanks for the reply. There were no error messages. The only change made was the installation of the ASP.NET 4 extended version. After I installed this extended version I began getting a lot of Event ID 1020 warnings about a component being missing or
 installation corrupted. I removed the extended version Thursday and everything returned to normal except at first boot in the morning when Task Scheduler wouldn't display the Run Duration of "All running tasks" without a restart.&nbsp;
<div><br />

<div>https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=88f4e6602aa54082&amp;sa=639586959#cid=88F4E6602AA54082&amp;id=88F4E6602AA54082%211817</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry if I wasn't more specific with my description of the issue. Yesterday afternoon I went into Task Scheduler and disabled two tasks for 'RealPlayerUpdate' and changed the Properties of some of the other tasks and this morning everything worked as it
 should. I should be more familiar with a utility as versatile as Task Scheduler but I'm not exactly a "Power User" and I never bothered to teach myself on its proper use. The problem only happened at first boot of the day and since I've disabled both tasks
 for RealPlayer which ran at a specific time in the A.M. and A.S.A.P. if missed the problem is fixed. This morning I checked it and everything is back to normal. I did run the Safety Scanner anyway and it found nothing wrong. I don't know what exactly caused
 the "Run Duration" to show as unavailable because I made a few modifications in the properties of the scheduled tasks. Thankfully I didn't have to worry about a currupted User Profile. I've had one before and it can be a nightmare to diagnose when you have
 one. Sorry if I repeated myself but it is early and I wanted to get back to you in a timely fashion. I don't know what the answer to this quesion turned out to be so I'll let you decide in case anyone else has issues. Thanks again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. It seems I've also forgotten how to post a 'hot-link' to SkyDrive. Sorry! lol</div>

<p><span><span>If you have not installed the latest drivers for the Network adapter card (Sierra) then, I would suggest you to install the latest drivers and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi Adrima</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The DHCP Client Service in Windows 7 depends on the components posted by you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If one of the above drivers fail to start, then the DHCP Client Service may not start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To fix the issue, folow these steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Make sure that the three driver files are present</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to %Windir%\System32\Drivers folder. Make sure that the following files are present in the folder:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>afd.sys</span></li><li><span>tcpip.sys</span></li><li><span>netbt.sys</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If one or more of the above driver files are missing, run System File Checker (SFC) scan to replace those files.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case SFC scan doesn’t repair the files, follow the steps given in the link above on how to repair those corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Verify that the Dependency Service / components are running</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Next step is to verify that the three dependency components are running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type "DEVMGMT.MSC" without the quotes in the field and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the View menu, click&nbsp; <strong><em>Show hidden devices.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click&nbsp;<em>Non-Plug
 and Play drivers</em> section</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click
 the entry&nbsp; <strong>AFD (Ancilliary Function Driver for Winsock)&nbsp;</strong>, and click the Driver tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Set
 the Startup type to&nbsp; <strong><em>System</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Start
 the service. Note down the error message if any.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Similarly
 start the two other drivers namely:</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>TCP/IP Protocol Driver
 and&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>NetBios over Tcpip.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 Device Manager and restart Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That should be it.</span></p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

<p>You need to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate to change languages:</p>
<p><br />
----------------<br />
If it's a Win7 Ultimate computer, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972813 <br />
<br />
If not, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-an-input-language<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/language-packs<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-get-additional-display-languages<br />
------------------</p>
<p>You can change the language Windows uses to display text in wizards, dialog boxes, menus, and other items in the user interface. Some display languages are installed by default, while others require you to install additional language files.<br />
<br />
Before you can install a display language, you need access to the language files. These files can be found on your computer, a computer in your network, or your Windows DVD. They can also be downloaded from the web. For more information, see How do I get additional
 display languages?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To install a display language<br />
To install a Language Interface Pack (LIP), double-click the file to open the setup program. To install a Multilingual User Interface Pack (MUI), follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Click to open Region and Language. <br />
<br />
Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br />
<br />
Under Display language, click Install/uninstall languages, and then follow the steps.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
The Display language section will only be visible if you have already installed an LIP or if your edition of Windows supports an MUI. MUIs are only available in Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Enterprise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To change your display language<br />
When you change the display language, the text in menus and dialog boxes for some programs might not be in the language that you want. This happens because the program might not support Unicode. For more information about changing the text in menus and dialog
 boxes for programs that don't support Unicode, see Change the system locale.<br />
<br />
If you want to set the display language for multiple users or for the Welcome screen, see Apply regional and language settings to reserved accounts.<br />
<br />
Click to open Region and Language. <br />
<br />
Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br />
<br />
Under Display language, choose a language from the list, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
If you don't see the list of display languages, you need to install additional language files.<br />

<span>Hi Mrinal,</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
Have you made any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may enable VGA Mode &amp; check if the issue persists. This mode is useful if the display is configured for a setting that the monitor cannot display.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For more information, refer to these links:</span></p>

<p>Hi Jacob, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors we need to consider why your mouse is offset on your Start Menu. Kindly provide the following information to help you resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a wired mouse or a wireless mouse?</li><li>Since when have you been experiencing this issue?</li><li>Were there any changes on your PC before this happened like software or updates installed?</li><li>Are you experiencing this issue when navigating your PC or just on the Start menu?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we recommend updating your mouse driver from the manufacturer's website and see if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be here when you post back. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Storage space running out for no reason</h2>
                    My computer is about a year old. It runs on Windows10 64bit. Problem is, I don't do much on it except surf the net a lot, some Photoshop work, and a game or two.&nbsp; My C drive keeps running out of space. Of the 128GB that I had, there's a mere 3GB remaining.
 I'm sure my installations and files didn't do that. Heck, I hardly have any music on my system...and no movies. So why does the space keep going down? Is it being held up by something, and how can I clear it?

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

    <title>Static Image only from Bell Fibe to XB1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phrawst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Static Image only from Bell Fibe to XB1</h2>
                    
<p>Location: Ontario, Canada<br />
TV Service: Bell Fibe TV</p>
<p>Just tried hooking my cable box up to my XB1 last night with no luck. Basically all I get is a static image of whatever should be on screen that only updates once every 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for example if I hit the "guide" button on my tv remote about 30 seconds later I'll get the image of the guide, every button press takes about 30 seconds to register a result on screen. So no actual video takes place or audio. Only static frame grabs
 of the signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried hooking it up with various hdmi cables, by passing my av unit completely and just going from cable box &gt; xbox &gt; tv input. All scenarios create the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When going through the TV setup process at the end of it the image from the tv only appears as a small rectangle in the top right corner, just in case that's useful info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>OneGuide is not yet available to our friendly neighbors to the North (sorry Canada we still think you are groovy). Please send the make/model of cable box you are using. Even though the OneGuide is not available does not mean the pass-through won't work.
 It should be. Post back with the make/model of cable box, I will give you what I have.

<p>The issue IS with the Bell Fibe TV DVR. I had and STILL have the same problem. I have gone through 3 Xbox One's, 6 different and very expensive HDMI cables and 3 different television sets. The common denominator in all this is the Bell Fibe DVR that seems
 to be causing the issue. I have tried 720P &amp; 1080 resolution to no avail. I have taken my Xbox to a friend with Videotron and the TV passthrough works great. So there you have it. Until Bell comes out with a new unit, you are pretty much stuck with the problem.
 I had to resort to removing the TV passthrough from the Xbox One and using it strictly for gaming. Bummer...</p>

<p>The newer model bell fibe PVR unit works.. well should i say worked until the april 2014 patch. Now the cable box and the xbox both need a full reboot every time to make tv work once the pvr has gone into that sleep mode thing it does.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Talk talk might not be compatible with Windows 8. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer for that.</span></p>
<p><span>Here I would like to let you know about the features of Mail app in Windows 8. You can configure your mail accounts in mail app and use them. You can also configure the windows live accounts in mail app. So it is not necessary to install Windows live

            <p>Hello Richard, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reviewed the TalkTalk emails settings page (<a href="http://help.talktalk.co.uk/app/answers/detail/a_id/1668/~/what-are-talktalk's-email-settings%3F#TalkTalk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.talktalk.co.uk/app/answers/detail/a_id/1668/~/what-are-talktalk's-email-settings%3F#TalkTalk</a>)&nbsp;and
 it appears that their default settings use POP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POP3 is not supported in the Mail app. Please see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/pop-email-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/pop-email-accounts</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mail app supports the EAS and IMAP protocols. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TalkTalk page does&nbsp;have an optional settings section that mentions IMAP, however the settings they provided in this section are&nbsp;specific to POP3. You may need to contact them directly to determine if you are able to&nbsp;connect using IMAP or EAS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also have the same problem.&nbsp; Windows 7/64, Broadcomm installed, Bose AE2w headphones, Insignia Bluetooth USB dongle.&nbsp; Broadcomm "sees" the headphones.&nbsp; When I turn them on, the icon lights up on the Windows Explorer screen, when I turn them off, the icon
 goes "grey".&nbsp; When I try to "connect", after a delay, I get the message "Error connecting to headset. Please retry this operation."&nbsp; I've tried every combination of setup options, tried each and every "services" choice in the hardware setup, installed the
 Bose update - nothing works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be something to with this PC and Win 7/64 combination as the same headset and dongle work fine on my other computer, which is also Win7/64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. I see that you have tried all the possible steps, we appreciate all the efforts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you able to pair other Bluetooth device to this specific computer? </p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to pair any other Bluetooth device to the computer and check the results. If you are unable to pair other devices, you may have to update the Bluetooth driver to the latest by visiting computer Manufacturer website. Some of the users
 were able to resolve the issue by updating the Bluetooth drivers. </p>

<p>Also applies to Windows 7. </p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please follow the steps given here to uninstall and then reinstall the Bluetooth driver.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Touchpad Gestures Stopped Working with Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 on my Lenovo yoga 2 13 laptop and the 3 finger gestures were still working then. I was able to scroll through the different windows and summon cortana. However, when I put my laptop to sleep, the 3 finger gestures stopped
 working. I still have 2 finger scrolling abilities and I can do the 3 finger tap for cortana. Has this happened to anyone else? If so, how did you fix it?
