<h2>            Can&#39;t open .jpeg photos downloaded via Bluetooth from my Lumia Windows phone</h2>
                    I downloaded several .jpeg photos via Bluetooth from my Lumia Windows phone to Windows 8 (Samsung 9 series laptop).<br />
Can't open the pictures with any of these programs:<br />
Microsoft Office 2010<br />
Windows Photo Viewer<br />
Photos<br />
Photo Gallery&nbsp;<br />
Paint<br />
<br />
Error messages:<br />
"Windows Photo Viewer cant open this picture because either Photo Viewer doesn't support this file format or you don't have the latest updates to Photo Viewer." Unbelievable.<br />
"Photo Gallery cant open this photo or video. The file may be unsupported, damaged or corrupted."<br />
"Paint cannot read this file. This is not a valid bitmap file or its format is not currently supported."<br />
Photos: no error message, just a grey screen with the name of the file opened in the corner.<br />
<br />
Which kind of file format would be more supported then!?<br />
And yes, I know I should use SkyDrive. But thought Windows phone would sync with Windows 8 smoothly...<br />
PLEASE.

    <title>Playable Robin Confirmed as pre-order bonus&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Playable Robin Confirmed as pre-order bonus&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, it's been rumoured for quite sometime that we'd be getting some Robin, The Flying Graysons Poster only added fuel to the fire, and now we have confirmation.&nbsp; Best Buy's pre-order bonus is an exclusive playable Robin which can be used on two different
 Challenge Maps.&nbsp; I'm hoping that this&nbsp;opens the door&nbsp;on other DLC playable characters/suits after the release, such as Nightwing or my personal wish, a Batman Beyond suit.</p>

<p>Anyone think that this Robin looks too angry? The boy wonder seems to have some serious angst issues. I've liked so much of the design work for this series, but Robin isn't really working for me. Eh, it's one picture, maybe It'll grow on me.

<p>I dunno, it sounds like a nice pre-order bonus though, two extra maps and another Robin skin as well. &nbsp;He looks, to me, more like the *** Grayson version, didn't Tim Drake have more hair? &nbsp;I'd really love to see a Batgirl character for Challenge Mode as

<p>Have you seen the Catwoman gameplay demo? &nbsp;How can you not get all hot and bothered by that? &nbsp;Robin will be optional, but you may as well get used to some Meow Mix for it's been said that she'll take up about 10% of the campaign. &nbsp;You appear to have low

<p>Not low expectations at all. I'm genuinely excited about this game. And unlike the first game, I will be getting this game day 1 instead of months later. I just don't care about any of the other playable characters in a game designed around, and for, Batman.
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Not a bad thing to include them. Certainly doesn't hurt the replay value. I have seen the Catwoman gameplay vids and as long as it's only 10%, I can deal with it. Might be a nice change, but Batman's the meat and potatoes of the game and now that they've
 finally done a superhero game some justice all I wan't is more of the Batman experience because I certainly didn't get enough of it in the first game.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>To be clear, I prefer the dirty version of Harley Quinn from Arkham Asylum over the cleaned up version of her in Arkham City and Catwoman all day long.

<p>Forgiveness, I meant for the "low expectations" to be for the playable Catwoman. &nbsp;I think everyone, including the developers themselves, has nothing but the highest of expectations for the overall game. &nbsp;I kinda like the redesigned Harley Quinn, the "naughty
 nurse" was suitable for the "hospital" environment of the first game, but the city needs a more urbanized look which I feel they captured nicely, the more familiar red and black outfit looks great. &nbsp;I'm still getting over Arleen Sorkin's departure though,
 from what I've heard the replacement (Tara Strong I think) has filled in admirably, but for me, Arleen Sorkin IS Harley Quinn. &nbsp;As far as having more of the Batman experience, what little we've seen so far leads me to believe that we're about to all get blown
 away, I'm especially looking forward to resonating that sonic frequency to summon the bats, that'll be way cool...:-)

                    <p>my controller does not allow me to turn off my Xbox remotely, or when I do it through the menu.&nbsp;when I hold down the Xbox button it just vibrates and doesn't give me an option of turning my Xbox off.&nbsp;</p>

To hard reset the console press and hold the power button on the front of the console for 5-10 seconds once the console has shut down please also remove the power supply cable from the wall out for a few minutes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Once you have done this please re connect everything power up the console and hopefully you will be able to now shut down the console with the controller.<br /></p>

<h2>            IIS 8.5 simple ASPX pages takes 10 minutes to load</h2>
                    <p>I am running IIS8.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2 and have 9 websites up and running. Some are MVC4 and some are classic ASP. Three of the ASP websites run perfectly, however, one of them takes 10 minutes to load. This is a simple web page with only one hit
 to the database and is very similar to other ASP websites running on the same server that run just fine. I have reviewed the logs for IIS and Windows and have enabled Failed Request Tracing. In the FRT generated for this page AspNetPageLoadEnter has a timestamp
 of 16:26:03.598 and then AspNetPageLoadLeave has a timestamp of 16:36:08.739. The page load event on the page simply sets a few variables and makes one call to the database to populate a grid of about 20 to 30 rows. This same database call is used on other
 pages in the other websites so I don't thing this is the problem. Each website uses its own app pool but they are set up identically. The other ASP websites load in under 10 seconds. Does anyone have any idea why the page load event for this page takes 10
 minutes? Could there be an IIS setting that I am missing somewhere? I have tried accessing this page from multiple computers and directly on the server with the same results.

<h2>            Netflix on Windows 10 Upgrade - Can&#39;t Install</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I did a clean install of windows 8.1 to wait for my windows 10 upgrade, but I got bored waiting so I tried to download some apps like .. Netflix and Hulu from the Windows Store.. I downloaded Hulu with No problems... but when I tried to download Netflix
 I got an Error and that I should try again ... I ignored the issue and then when my windows 10 upgrade was ready I upgraded, to my surprise now every time I try to access the Netflix store page the store crashes to desktop... it closes up entirely .. I tried
 wsreset.exe and it doesn't do anything that works.... it still happens, if I go to the store via web browser I can see the app's page but it automatically opens the store and leads to another crash, can anyone help or is anyone having this same problem??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not resell Volume Licenses, which a lot of companies use..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computers&nbsp;are scrapped computers from Dell, HP, etc., with preinstalled operating system&nbsp;Licenses, NO. You can only sell them as the complete original package; as in the computer with the license/operating system&nbsp;still installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            bootrec error element not found</h2>
                    I attempted to repair windows 7 using the bootrec command with the following steps. fixmbr completed successfully but the other commands give an error element not found. However scan os and rebuild bcd recognize the os but when I tried rebuild it gave
 the same error. Is there anything else I can do or should I just cut my losses and rebuild all of my data that would be lost (which is a lot) I am running win7 hp 64 bit on a custom pc. Thanks for any ideas

            I was having the same problem and this is what helped me.
<div><br />
<div><b><u>problem 1.</u></b>&nbsp; from "bootrec error - element not found" to "bootmgr is missing"</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I made progress but still not there yet. </span>
<b>In diskpart i used select part and then made partition active.
</b><span>Then rebooted and now it says something new </span>
<b>"bootmgr is missing."</b><span> I used the win7 disk and now it does find my win7 installation. It still does not boot but progress has been made nonetheless.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><b><u>problem 2.</u>&nbsp; </b>from "bootmgr is missing" to "problem solved"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Using win7 disk to get to <b>cmd prompt I typed bcdboot C:\windows /l en-us</b> "enter" and that fixed or replaced bootmgr. &nbsp;</span></div>
<br />
<span>Problem solved!!! &nbsp;Booted into windows and everything is fine!</span>

<p>If this is the case there should be a different game to download but not knowing where you are I couldn't tell you what it is.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 maps offline directions.</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 10 maps on the Microsoft surface 3, and have downloaded maps to use offline. I also have a GPS Dongle which works ok. The problem that I have is that I have to go online to get directions, which is not always possible. Is there any way
 to get directions from the offline maps without going online (ie where there is no Wi-Fi signal)?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The offline maps can be used by any app that uses the map control. The functionality Offline Maps under Settings/System/Maps only allows you to manage the offline maps (download, update and delete them).&nbsp; You can view the maps you have downloaded (and the
 whole world when you're online) through the Maps app. Just search for a place (e.g. Australia) and it will take you to that part of the world. You can then explore by searching for places or directly interacting with the map to pan, zoom, rotate and even tilt.
 If you want to see roads you just have to zoom in enough to the place you want to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

            <p>Correct, you should be able to do searches and get driving and walking directions without the need to have Internet connectivity when you have downloaded offline maps for the areas involved.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have Windows&nbsp; 10 with the MAPS program and maps (charts) downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to get it (MAPS)&nbsp;to do anything once I am disconnected from the internet... no driving, and no walking directions.&nbsp; The map just sits there stagnating...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also purchased a Microsoft GPS 360 Pharos USB GPS device... the device manager sees the GPS but none of my Mapping or Navigation programs will see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get&nbsp;Windows 10 to use the USB GPS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Same here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Surface Book running Windows 10 Maps, charts downloaded. Microsoft Pharos GPS device connected to USB, seen on COM3 port, "working properly" - according to Device Manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, Maps&nbsp; will not find "current location", will not follow while driving. This GPS device used to work with Streets and Trips and with Autoroute.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I connect the application to GPS coordinates? Any advice would be appreciated.

            <p>I find it amazing that so many people have found that the feature to select which webcam should be set as default is missing as helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only 14 people were able to use the instructions above. I believe they used method 2 which is ludicrous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an example of Microsoft removing a feature for our convenience? Or do they just feel we are too technically challenged to know how to set a default webcam within device manager and removed the option?</p>

            I accidentally clicked the solved my problem link because the way the links are nested is extremely misleading. I thought it was saying that 111 people had solved this problem, i.e. replied with a possible solution, and only realized after clicking that
 it was something different and there is no option to remove the click. I imagine this is what the 111 people before me did as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Additionally I completely agree with you. Method two is NOT a solution. If you have more than two "webcams" there are reasons for it. I have numerous virtual webcam sources that I need active when streaming with OBS. My Roxio capture card is second in this
 list. If I disable it, I won't be able to use it in OBS without going through the hassle of re-enabling it. Even if I removed the webcam drivers that I never use, my c920 would still be third on this list and thus unusable in MEmu as my front or rear camera.&nbsp;

            <p>(sigh.....)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not surprised AT ALL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My logitech webcam icon used to sit on my start bar across the bottom of the screen. Now not only is the icon gone, but it appears the entire app is gone. When I search my C: drive, there is nothing with the name Logitech - not an executable, not a text
 file, not even a folder..... (double sigh....) </p>
<p>
</p><p>My webcam shows up as a device in apps and devices, but if I right click on it, the only option is remove the device (you know, that device that no longer can be found anywhere). I tried to just bite the bullet and use MS's camera/video, but it ate up so
 much memory that the system seized up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure it must be SOME kind of new feature to make our lives easier and better because Redmond would NEVER deliberately do something that would make users' machines stop working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I haven't yet adjusted to the new paradigm like I should. &nbsp;</p>

            I found out last week that Microsoft changed the data structure (contract) used between camera drivers and the new Microsoft Media Foundation classes. &nbsp;Camera mfrs expected to recompile their drivers for Windows 8.1 (but of course their incentive is to
 sell new cameras). &nbsp;Changed my code to old deprecated DirectX so it would WORK. Thanks for the stinking big AVI files, Redmond. API contracts used to mean something.

            On Devices and Printers, right click on the camera, as with this type of device, that option does not exist. In my case, I already disabe the integrated camera, but yet the Logitech does not pops up as the default.

<h2>            My computer won&#39;t let me use its keyboard.</h2>
                    Last night I put my computer into sleep mode. Then I tried to turn my computer back on and it would not respond. So I then pressed the power button to restart it. After that my computers display turned off but my computer stayed on for like 5 minutes.
 Now it will not respond to any thing I do with my keyboard but it will respond to my mouse. I can't even use it before windows starts up and I've tried using older keyboards and diffrent usb ports but they won't work either.&nbsp;

 resetting keyboard settings. I checked devices and it tells me my keyboard is working--it's not. I tried another usb port. nothing.&nbsp;what now? I'm writing this on the on screen keyboard. any suggestions.</p>

<div>I tried the three things you suggested. no luck. 1. hardware/devices trouble shooter indicates that I need to reinstall a pci bridge. as far as l know there was never one installed--whatever a pci bridge happens to be. 2. the procedure for clean boot does
 not work. l typed in mcconfig in search and it led no where. 3. I uninstalled the updates which did not solve the problem. l'm a writer and need the keyboard.</div>

<span><span>neilsorenson</span></span></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your description I understand that you are having issue with keyboard after installing update.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s start with some questions</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which update are you referring to is it Windows update? If Windows update could you please provide me with the kb article of that update?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To check which update have been installed follow the steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To view your update history
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Open </span><span>Windows</span><span> Update in Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span> (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span>), entering </span><strong><span>Windows</span><span> Update</span></strong><span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Settings</strong></span><span>, and then tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Install optional updates</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>In the left pane, tap or click <span><strong>View update history</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the security software installed on your computer?</p>
<p>3. Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you try the following methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Hardware and device troubleshooter.</p>
<p>You can try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span>), entering </span><span><strong>hardware and devices</strong></span><span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Settings</strong></span><span>, and then tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Find and fix problems with devices</strong></span><span>.</span>‌
<span>You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.</span></p>
<p>Follow the link for reference.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly#section_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windo<span>ws-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly#section_6</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clean boot.</p>
<p><span><br />
I would want to do <b>clean boot and then check the Keyboard</b>. Please follow the link and instructions mentioned in the link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><b><span>: Once done with the troubleshooting, follow the steps in
</span></b><b><span>Step 3</span></b><b><span> to reset the computer to normal startup."</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3: If the above methods don’t work then I want you to uninstall the update and then check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do get back to us and let me know the status of the issue in your next post</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Neil,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with the keyboard not working after installing a Window Update. It can be difficult
 when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and the model of the keyboard?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is/are the KB article number(s) of the update?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message or error code when you try to use the keyboard?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Method 1–</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Since you have tried all the troubleshooting steps, I would have you perform a System Restore on the computer to undo the changes made.</p>
<p>Refer the article-</p>
<span>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
Note: Performing a System Restore will undo all the changes that were made on the computer prior to the issue. You may also lose unsaved information as well.
 Proceed at your own risk.
<p>Make sure you perform only a “restore” on the computer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If the issue does not persist after a restore, I would have you proceed to Method 2.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Method 2-</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a
</span><span>Clean Boot.</span><span><br />
<br />
Placing the computer in a </span><span>Clean Boot</span><span> state helps in identifying if
</span><span>any third party applications</span><span> or
</span><span>startup items</span><span> are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article</span><span>-</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7, or Windows 8.</span><span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note</span><span>: You need to follow
</span><span>Step</span><span>
</span><span>3</span><span> from the article to get the computer back to
</span><span>Normal Startup</span><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Now, try to install the update while the computer is in a Clean Boot state.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Do let us know if you have any other queries pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to
 help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence and provide our customers with the best support.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Someone responded to my second cry for help suggesting a reset--that did not work. I then reinstalled windows8--that did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there is something in winows8 that thinks the on screen keyboard is active when its not. Could it be the program does not like my keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My keyboard is a Microsoft comfort curve ku-0456 and its on a desk top computer.

What machine?&nbsp;&nbsp; Some users have found that they needed to update BIOS or change some BIOS settings to work around this symptom.</p>

<p>l typed in mcconfig in search and it led no where.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p><br />
If the above typo is what you tried that would be why "it led no where".&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; I thought there might be a simpler way of finding&nbsp; System Configuration&nbsp;Utility&nbsp; but it is not indexed and apparently even unknown to the Control Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you have to enter the full program name precisely:&nbsp;&nbsp; msconfig.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As usual&nbsp; both Windows Help and Windows Search&nbsp; were completely useless for helping us finding anything which should have been obvious to help correct this mistake without having such arcane knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; now it's trying to prove me wrong, even though I thought I had tried this:&nbsp; Win-F1&nbsp; System Configuration&nbsp;&nbsp; finds&nbsp; What is System Configuration? &nbsp;and that document actually has a link to open it without knowing anything about&nbsp; msconfig.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Thanks for making me find this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>

In fact, there is an easier (but still arcane) route via Control Panel and search for Tools (or Admin)</p>

            This has now happen to me with two of my windows 8 machines, nothing I did resolved the keyboard issue of it not working. However as others have stated the keyboard works to enter the system password. I finally got fedup with this and advance restarted
 my system to conduct a system restore, amazing is my keyboard worked fine while I was in system restore, go figure. Well I roled my system back from the critical update it received on January 29, 2013 and my keyboard returned to service.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to
 research why this behavior is occuring. And after reading through the many notes on this subject, I feel it is not isolated to a paticular piece of hardware.&nbsp; I have a DELL XPS M1730 that this occured on, and my other system is a home built PC with an i7 processor.

            You must be one of the lucky ones, my computer is almost brand new and the updates put it into an endless loop of "Update failed etc" and just kept trying to install, fail, install, fail. Had to hard stop use recovery usb and use a saved mirror image.&nbsp;
 Stopped automatic updates.

<p>Your post is really disturbing Patrick. We get these reports all the time here in the Insider forums. But to find them with new computers with Release versions of Windows 10 is really bad.</p>
<p>How about posting here your computer stats + the build number you were on before the attempt? Plus any 3rd party AV or any USB or SD type that might have interfered with the update. Just to try to eliminate any problems were you experiencing any problems
 before KB4346783. Because you type "the updates" … plural …?</p>

<p>Really sorry to know that dear friend.......I fail to understand when a lot of users are facing similar issue since last update released for window 10 64bit, then why microsoft is not helping them out. Even I am facing similar issue, can't update my windows
 10 (oem)....Though my laptop is working fine without any issue except it has slowed down and lags sometimes since last 2-3 weeks. However, windows virus definitions are updated daily. This means there is something wrong with windows update only. I tried all
 sort of steps listed on internet and even used windows troubleshooter but of no help.&nbsp;</p>

            I solved it! I've found some posts in the StackOverflow about removing the directory "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution" but doesn't work from the Windows 10 itself.<br />
<br />
So I created a bootable pen drive with Linux, entered into "C:\Windows" dir and deleted the "SoftwareDistribution".<br />
<br />
When I started the Windows 10 again the Windows Update went back to work.<br />

<p>
</p><p>-Ok, now I've discovered that clicking on Word or Excel doesn't work either.&nbsp; But if I click on a document that has already been created … I can open that.</p>

<h2>            Language in the Sea of Thieves</h2>
                    <p>I just bought the game yesterday, and I read the update. It says that the game has the Chinese language, but I could not find any language setting in the game. Even I changed my location to Hong Kong and reinstall the game. It still in English.</p>
<p>Could someone help me with that?</p>
