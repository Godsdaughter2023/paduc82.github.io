<h2>            Cpu running at 65&#37; memory at 51&#37;</h2>
                    I have had the problem of my cpu running at 65% and the ram at 51% while the hard drive does all kinds of grinding away with stuff from microsoft coming and going by the look of it. When I found someone had stopped the media player to fix this problem
 I did the same thing and sure enough it fixes it but now I cannot watch movies. It seems that it is either the wmpnetwk.exe using the cpu or the W something or other sharing center doing it on another occasion. I thought for a moment that it might just be
 some of those guys from the torrents crowd or possibly someone from the open source group as i have earned the ire of at least one of those guys at Handbrake. I also found another thing that got onto my desktop without my doing. It was a 'mediawrap' that blocked
 me from certain functions on certain websites. Like my webcam was not seen and the video player on another one was just not there. Then I noticed it down in the corner of my desktop. It's an open source firefox addon. Meantime I w

<p>Hi xoral,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
I will need some more information to assist you better.<br />
a)&nbsp;Do you get any error message while you are unable to play movies in Windows Media Player?<br />
<br />
I will suggest you to uninstall and reinstall Windows Media Player using Turn Windows Feature on or off and check if you come across the similar issue.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp;To turn a Windows feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a Windows feature off, clear the check box.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click OK.<br />
<br />
For more information on Turn Windows Feature on or off, you may visit the link mentioned below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a></p>
<p><br />
For Central Processing Unit(CPU) usage you may follow the steps mentioned bleow:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: Clean Boot.</strong><br />
<br />
Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.<br />
To find out which startup application is causing the issue, you may perform clean boot.<br />
Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. <br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start Collapse this imageExpand this ima, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
Collapse this imageExpand this imageIf you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)
<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Note: Set the computer in normal start startup after the issue is resolved.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:Disk Cleanup utility</strong><br />
<br />
I will suggest you to use disk clean up utility to delete the files that are not necessary for you.<br />

3 a menu will come with many options, click at boot and then look for timeout change timeout to 3 seconds.<br />
4 then click services and stop those services you not need, the click startup and uncheck the programs you not want to be opened automatically at startup.<br />
5 click apply and then ok, system will ask for restart. <br />

<br />
<br />
for less memory and ram<br />
<br />

            What I did was shut down the media player and the cpu usage went to 1or 2% and the memory to&nbsp; about 15%. I continued working around it and whenever I needed it I would turn it back on. The last thing that started happening was that the media player started
 to load up all the microsoft various noises for alerts like shutting down plus it picked up a bunch of ringtones then it got some sound effects and as I would be deleting these ( better than 7000 files ) it would replace them over the next little while. AT
 the end of it I noticed that it would not even let me delete them it just jumped ahead of the delete function with the updating thing. I wiped the drive and reninstalled the OS as I was at my wits end with it. Not only did this thing have me chasing it around
 but Premiere elements was doing all kinds of things with me also. One minute it would work as it should the next no. It crashed about seventeen times. The last straw was today, I had bought&nbsp;a boxing day special of a sound recorder and made a video with the
 recorder picking up the sounds of a cello from a busker. When I got home and loaded the files into the Organizer that came with Premiere and tried to find them to make the movie clip they just were not anywhere to be found but did turn up on the media player
 library between a bunch of sound effects. So a clean install and a few hail mary's.
<br />
Thanks for your help.

            It was the media player that was taking all the cpu and memory. The boot time was never slow at all. It always booted fast. The cpu used to run at 65% and the memory at 51% of 8gigs that's 4gigs while it was supposed to be at idle. Shut the media player
 out and everything went back to normal, but no media player. Finally today got sick of chasing the problems and did a hard disk wipe and a clean install. I will see if the media player repeats it's nonesense. One strange thing was when I would be working on
 something I would quite often see the little ball ( Media CEnter Logo ) on the task bar loading updates but could never find out what they were. Four of five of them a week, very quietly doing so. The way I found out was to click on the thing when it appeared.
 When I was too slow to get to it before it blinked out and I went to the media center to look to see there was no apparent additions to the fare. I really wish the things was out of my computer but it is linked to the media player.

            When you say that you did a clean install, are you using a clean Windows 7 disk (64 bit I presume)? or are you using a restore disk that comes from the computer manufacturer? The reason I ask is that what you describe does not happen in a clean Windows
 7 environment. You could clean install and then load WMP or Media Center and still none of this would happen (Media Center can be a little bit of a hog on weaker systems). Win7 might do some initial updates but that is all. Either the computer you have is
 installing and loading a bunch of junk or you are downloading some programs that are doing this, in either case, going to msconfig can help cut down on start-up items (although I would be careful about what services to shut down--you can often google the service
 name to find out what it does.) Often, manufacturers will include unneeded (and often bloated and poorly written) software with their drivers (for sound cards or cameras). Many of these products load in the background and use both memory

In Windows Live Mail on the W7 machine, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>
Advanced</em> tab, click <em>Maintenance</em> and then <em>Store folder</em>. Copy the path shown in the box, paste it into the start search box and press
<em>Enter</em>. This should open an Explorer window at your store folder, which is where all your messages, folders, account settings and calendars are stored. You should then copy the entire folder to the new machine and place all its&nbsp;contents into a folder
 called <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> at</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}<strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then install Windows Essentials 2012. The installer should find the store folder and take it into use. You will have to re-enter account passwords and re-create any message rules you may have had on the old machine.</p>

</p><p>I never buy another Surface ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Time with a surface was the worst purchasing experience of my life. It consisted of a series of replacements until my warranty ran out. When ordering my first one, the UPS driver left it on my porch, on a main street. I guess when they throw in free shipping
 for a thousand dollar purchase, they couldn't spring for the signature option. When I turned it on, it emitted a loud buzzing sound from the screen. I phoned and sent it back and they sent me a replacement... when the replacement arrived it made the same noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for a refund so I could go to a physical store,&nbsp; buy one, listen to and not have to deal the returning it&nbsp; through UPS anymore. UPS lost my return and I had a $1000 hold on my credit card for over a month. Yet, foolishly I was not dissuaded from
 Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I purchased my Surface Pro 2 in January of 2014. I had owed it less than 3 months when on March 7</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">th</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">, &nbsp;a firmware updated caused the hard drive to freeze on

 in February of last year, my touch screen stopped responding. Again, when I spoke to an agent helpful and professional. He guided me through the troubleshooting steps, but ultimately determined that my Surface needed to be replaced. Now, 7 months later, my
 hard drive has died again, yet I am not covered under warranty.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have had one pen replacement and two powersuplys (the last of which, emitted sparks into my hair)

 to replace it. This unit is the third Surface Pro 2 that I have had sent to me as a replacement. I received the most recent one a view days before my warranty was scheduled to expire. I told the him what my experience had been and that I was reluctant to spend
 another $542.00 on a device that had been so unreliable.&nbsp; I said I would think about it, but, regardless of how much of a help it is to me, I would probably start shopping around for something new. I don’t have an extra $542.00 (really, who does?) and even
 if I did, I why would I spend it on another refurbished Surface Pro 2.—especially when I have had such bad luck with reliability.</span></p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>The service agent agreed with me said that my experience had been unfortunate. He told me that he would&nbsp;“take&nbsp;fully&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;on&nbsp;this” and would contact me within&nbsp;“24&nbsp;hours&nbsp;thru&nbsp;email&nbsp;once&nbsp;the request&nbsp;is&nbsp;confirmed”…</span></p>

</p><p>I am a disabled student who is extremely dependent on my computer.&nbsp; My surface has been the most effective resource I have ever owned. My surface is my only means of non-verbal communication. Being without it is for me is comparable to the average person
 losing the use of their hands. If Microsoft is unable to exchange it for me at a reduced cost, fine, I'm a little pissed off that I paid $1100 to beta test hardware for MS, but it is what it is. However, they could have kept me informed so could come up with
 an alternative plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;after waiting on hold for 20 minutes an dealing with another Tec support guy, I was told: yep, hard drive is malfunctioning. No warranty? Ya, you are SOL.I understand that a company cannot offer a lifetime warranty on a tablet. Unfortunately, I have never
 had a surface last more than a year</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>^^That's a false statement. Microsoft dose&nbsp;offer extended warranties for the surface pro. In fact you are offered warranty options many times during the purchase process and after. You don't own a surface, don't pay attention much, or you are an Apple troll.
 And besides, there are NO Apple products that can compare to the Surface pros unless you are a super light user. As a network administrator, system builder, and tech pro I can confirm that not a single Apple can achieve the usefulness of a windows product
 not to mention a Surface Pro. </p>

I'm sorry this happened to you and I did not enjoy the bsod much myself. That said this happened to a VERY small percent of the Surface Pros and with technology of any kind, including the finest motherboards/SSDs/memory/gpus&nbsp;on the planet, you from time to
 time get a broken unit. After hundreds of thousands of computer builds I'm amazed how few broken Surfaces go out/turn up especially with how short of time Microsoft has been building hardware. That says a lot!

            <p>Hi weasel101.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was doing some research on choosing a new laptop when I can across Shubado's post. I was checking out some of the negative comments concerning the Surface Pro to see what was going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to decide whether to jump ship and switch to a MacBook Pro, or replace my old laptop (Toshiba Satellite Pro) with the new Surface Pro 4.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my old laptop from Windows 7 to 10. The upgrade worked fine, but a small issue led me to Microsoft Tech Support, and unfortunately they really screwed up Windows (via remote access) to the point I can't run Windows properly. I could re-install
 Windows, but I'm thinking it might be easier to just purchase a new system. The Surface Pro 4 released a few days ago looks pretty attractive. I am using an iPad (for my needs, it's been great). But I would prefer a system that will run a full version of Microsoft
 Office, so that I can work from home (via remote access, or offline), if necessary. I don't like the Windows 10 UI, but I know Microsoft did a great job under the hood, and I realize that over the next while Microsoft will roll out UI enhancements and improvements.
 I don't watch movies on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's your advice and experience with the Surface Pro's?&nbsp;What ports are available? As an Office user that works with huge amounts of data, PowerPoint presentations, e-mail, and works with many photos, is the Surface Pro a better choice than the MacBook?
 I'm a long time Windows user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rupertsland, Canada&nbsp;</p>

            <p>IMHO you have to decide "how" you work.&nbsp; Surface pro's are best for sitting on a desktop.&nbsp; When I travel often my lap is where my computer resides - in planes/trains&nbsp; - often I set my device on my lap for best work.&nbsp; I also type when I work and I mean --
 type.&nbsp; Not swipe, not read emails, but honest to goodness typing.&nbsp; Thus the kickstand of the surface is not good.&nbsp; They just came out with a Surface book that has a more true laptop base but still you can take the screen off when you want a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface comes with one usb, I think the new book comes with two.&nbsp; If you have huge amounts of data, you then need huge amounts of ram and neither the Surface book/pro nor the MacBook are cheap when you get up to those ones with 16 gigs of ram.&nbsp; Remember
 on these types of devices - there's no upgrading of these.&nbsp; The memory is soldered into the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both a Surface and a Lenovo Carbon X1 - which is kinda equivalent to a book in it's thinness but not in it's geek drooling over at this time.&nbsp; I take the Surface when I want to be really light and really portable.&nbsp; I still grab the Carbon when I know
 I'm going to be doing a lot of typing in the plane/train.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really see the Surface book as solving the problem I had with the regular Surface - it sucks when your lap is your only place to put your device.</p>

Followed by following: Windows Media Player cannot play, sync, or burn the protected file because a problem occurred with the Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) system. You might need to connect to the Internet to update your DRM components.<br />
And to this i s no solution.<br />
I have tried to download KB891122-x86-ENU.exe, but got following&nbsp; message: Not enough storage is available to process this command.<br />
Not even MicrosoftFixit.winmediaplayer.run.exe can fix this problem!<br />

Is it possible to delete and reinstall windows media player in a win7 ultimate? <br />

<h2>            Failed Patch Tuesday Update - error 0x8024a206. Win10</h2>
                    <p>On my back-up Acer laptop, I'm currently running the November Patch Tuesday WUs. Going OK so far - touch wood - apart from KB2267602 (Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool) which failed - Status: Download error 0x8024a206.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only taken an hour or so and it's told me to restart - done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched in MSComm for this error code but the only 2017 threads are for mobile phones (and most are unanswered with over a 100 users waiting.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do please - install it manually from the Catalog?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited at 07:38 to clarify that I'm referring to my cheap 'n cheerful backup laptop that I purchased in case of this, my main laptop, being wiped out again by a WU.</p>

<p>How bizarre - just before the display disappeared after I hit 'restart' I saw a link in blue underneath the failed Windows MSRT item that said "retry" but the laptop shut down before I could press retry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the laptop restarted, Settings showed three WUs had been installed (KB2267602, the main one KB4048955 and KB4048951).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find bizarre is that Windows MSRT KB2267602 is not showing as "Failed" and that laptop is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now please?</p>

</p><p>Hello Gil. OK - I understand but shouldn't my Update History show that KB2267602 has been installed?</p>

</p><p>If not, it means that the Update History is suspect i.e. not always correct, doesn't it?</p>

 Thanks</p>

<p>Today's update on my back-up laptop included the failed Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool &amp; upped the build to 16299.98:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70af9073-3c25-46e0-a908-120e882ef169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70af9073-3c25-46e0-a908-120e882ef169" /></a></p>
<p>So all is now well. Just one final question - was today's WU expected, given it's not a Patch Tuesday?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jill. For you to get help now, after this long time, you really need to create your own, new thread. :o)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "metered connections", some internet service providers have lower charges if you accept a limit on how much you use ie the data sent &amp; received by your PC. Some users think it only applies to mobiles but it doesn't. In Australia for example I'm
 told it's quite common for providers to apply it to phone lines. &nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17452/windows-metered-internet-connections-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Cursor freezing when screen is moved&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I move my screen while it's attached to the base of my Surface Book my cursor will freeze for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have reinstalled the latest driver pack, played with the touch pad settings and cleaned the contacts.</p>
<p>MS wants to replace my Surface Book but I'm hesitant because mine seems better then most of the problems I see posted here. I'm worried I'll get one with more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only noticed this the&nbsp;past week or&nbsp;so, maybe it has something to do with the recent updates? Could it be hardware like the online techs think? Fwiw it is not acting up right now as I type this but has been a major problem the past week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that am beginning to regret this purchase. This will be my second advanced exchange. The first one was the first week the Surface was released. At that time I could not go more then a hour or two without a blue screen or total freeze up.</p>

            This may not be an option for you but if you can get to a Microsoft store they will help you and probably do an exchange. If you suspect the updates you could try rolling them back just to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;that changes the behavior. From your description, though,&nbsp;it
 sounds like a hardware issue, so an exchange is&nbsp;probably your next step.&nbsp;Best of luck.&nbsp;

                    <p>As the title says, I plugged in an US Xbox in Europe (Norway). The power in the house shut down for a few seconds. Is it probably broken or is it just the power supply that died? I&nbsp;consider&nbsp;buying an European power supply, but that's no point if it's already broken.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Ok. This should be the 3rd time I am asking this question on the community and not a single person has replied. The community I knew about a year and a half ago would have helped me with this issue. So ill try again.&nbsp;I have a Nokia Lumia 830 and I need to
 connect it to my phone. USB is enabled in settings on my phone as always but there seems to be an issue with the drivers on my device. Ill post a video of this issue. Ive tried so many sites, saying different things but nothing works.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 1607 PRODUCT KEY</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop came with&nbsp;pre-installed Windows 8.1 and later I upgraded to Windows 10. Previously when I installed W10 it didn't asked me for a product key. But now when I tried to reinstall W10 (Build1607) it asks for a product key which I don't have as the
 previous versions are activated using digital license. So I need to know how can I activate my W10 installation if I proceed the installation without a product key? Or do&nbsp;I have to still use the old W10 iso for installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Adding 2nd Hard drive as a Boot device &#47; BCDEDIT Problem</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add a second hard drive to my HP laptop, both drives have Windows Vista and are healthy. &nbsp;I can see both drives in Windows Explorer and access the files of both. &nbsp;They are both listed on the Computer Management and Device Manager. &nbsp;My BIOS
 does not show the option for a second hard drive to be used for booting. &nbsp;In order to add the device I have tried to use BCDEDIT. &nbsp;The error I keep getting is that "a description for the new entry must be specified". &nbsp;Here is what my log shows:</p>

            <p>You can add your second Vista to boot menu very easy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download and install <a href="http://www.boyans.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Visual BCD Editor">
Visual BCD Editor</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Start the tool and just type &lt;F9&gt; key. </p>
<p>This will add your second Vista automagically to boot menu by creating a loader entry for it in BCD. No need&nbsp;to specify any parameter as drive or&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is advisable to backup/export&nbsp;your current BCD before changing it - Visual BCD has this functionality as well as restore/import of a previously saved&nbsp;BCD.</p>

<p>I know this sounds stupid but i have know this to happen... have you checked all the power cables are connected also is the light on from the power brick? If not your problem may be the power brick (Fuse blown etc)</p>
<p>If not that does the xbox make any signs it may be getting power to it (For example if you are playing on a HDTV the "No signal" message disappears)

<p>This is what E75 is:</p>
<p>Overheating is the culprit- as the Xbox 360 does not have a particularly powerful cooling system, and has a cramped case, levels of heat inside your console rise quickly. Over time this excessive heat causes damage to the video scaler chip and graphics system,
 leading to malfunctions and eventually the e75 Xbox error. Basicly your xbox was not getting enough airflow and the motherboard flexed over and over again causing a cracked soder joint somewhere....</p>
<p>Although it may not be fixable if you are not under warranty (assuming you have an older generation of xbox 360) then I recromend just getting a Xbox 360 Slim because if Your xbox 360 not under warranty you will have to spend quite a bit of money to fix
 your it and even if Microsoft &nbsp;cant fix the xbox 360 then they send back a refubished one that will most likely red ring as well My recromendation is to just get the Xbox 360 slim because it runs WAY better than the xbox 360 original. Also do not open your
 Xbox 360 you will lose any way to have microsoft fix the console and if they find out that the console was tampered with than they will console ban you from xbox live for "System Tampering"
</p>
<p>From what this sounds like check your power brick it should be yellow when the xbox is not on and when the xbox is on it should be green. if it is RED than call xbox support.
</p>
<p>Hopes this helps in some way.....</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t understand Outlook.com and sync&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I used Outlook Express with Windows XP, but only to download mail from my Comcast.net server. If I understand correctly, I could use Outlook (from the Office suite) the same way.</p>
<p>However, in Windows 10 Mail I notice a "setting" that offers Outlook.com as an option. I've seen numerous references to this in posts here. How is this supposed to be used? Is it a separate e-mail account, such as might be set up in Yahoo or GMail?</p>
<p>All I want to do is download my mail from the server. And <em>I don't want </em>
any mail to be <em>deleted </em>from my "personal computer." I&nbsp;am struggling&nbsp;to find a way to prevent this by preventing any "synching" between my pc and the server.</p>
<p>Is it possible that I could accomplish this by using a "local" account when accessing my mail server?</p>
<p>Very frustrated Grandpa</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification regarding Outlook.com. I remain&nbsp;very interested in finding a way to download e-mail from the server and have it STAY. It appears that the POP3 setup is now replaced by IMAP--which allows synching.</p>
<p>I don't have any other devices, and I want to protect the mail that is in my Inbox. Again I ask, could this be accomplished by using a "local" sign-in account?</p>
<p>Or can any of the non-Microsoft email clients be set up with POP3, so that when the mail is downloaded the server is cleared and the mail is safely ensconced on my computer?</p>

<strong>1.</strong> Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums for any known issues. Update the Atheros driver. &lt;- These assume the device is<br />
an on-board device, If not check with the actual device maker. (Driver update methods<br />

<p><br />
Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and
<br />
when you get to the driver and memory testing sections refer to the generic methods in next<br />
message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.
<br />
<br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. <br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &lt;-- read link&nbsp;to see parameters<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560244(v=VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560244(v=VS.85).aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace. <br />
<br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            I have been having the same issue for a couple of weeks and I believe I've found the issue.&nbsp; It has to do with Live Mail's 2 step verification.&nbsp; I turned it off and the issue was corrected immediately.<br />
<br />
Go to www.live.com and sign into the account with issues.<br />
Click the gear in the upper right corner and select 'More mail settings' from the drop down menu.<br />
Under Managing Your Account click 'Account Details'.<br />
Click 'Security Info' from the left menu bar.<br />
Turn off 2 step verification.<br />
<br />
This fixed my issue.&nbsp; Not sure if there is a fix to have 2 step and use the Live Mail program.&nbsp; I'm just happy I can receive my emails again.

<h2>            My old account and why it should be unbanned</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Xbox Enforcement Team,<br />
<br />
So I've had my current account for a while now made new friends added a few old ones and such. (Spoiler alert I'm horrible at making sense and writing out paragraphs)<br />
My old account "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" and who ever says it's "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" doesn't know about Dragon Ball Z movie 12 (Fusion Reborn) or Dragon Ball GT. I just want it unbanned my reason? Why not just unban it? I recently found out
 why it got banned. (Officially before I only speculated)<br />
<br />

<p>I honestly don't know about the profile ban, but the "User Account Tampering" was kinda uncalled for. The reason I think I got banned was because I played Borderlands 2 A LOT and I went and got random characters with amazing builds with high levels because
 I didn't want to waste time leveling other characters up when the end game is so much fun. So I got this random character and when I got in it it had all area's unlocked (While I need like a few areas to get the achievments) so it gave me 4 achievements (maybe)
 and I (knowing a bit about the code of conduct) stuttered just froze and kinda broke down mentally and hoped for the best, a few weeks later I found my account banned and not going to lie I cried a bit then debated on either giving up on video games or...
 I don't honestly remember. Then I got this account which I've had for a while and got twice as many GS so I'd like my old account unbanned please.<br />

<p>The only way to contact the enforcement team is by submitting a case review on the enforcement website (<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enforcement.xbox.com</a>). However, since your enforcement took place longer than 18 months
 ago you may not be able to submit a review. Once accounts are banned, they are not unbanned though.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Z movie 12 &nbsp;do not follow that. So I would hit with banned for naughty words. The rule is rate g profiles. No way around. And do not get cute.
