            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Which OS is installed in your system 10 or 8.1?</p>
<p>2. Can you see your apps when you click on the Start Menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I would suggest that you perform Power Drain and check if you are able to see your icon on the desktop when the system re boot. To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Unplug the charger and remove the battery of your laptop, if using a desktop remove the power cord.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the Power button for 30sec
</span></li><li><span>Plug the charger/power cord and restart system</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            KB915597 for windows defender</h2>
                    Does the KB915597 win defend update protect against the KB971033 "spyware" call home every 90 days for checking that win is a "genuine" windows?<br />
<br />
The support info for the win defend definition says that spyware gathers info on one's system &amp; either report &amp; or change one's system; exactly what the KB971033 does.<br />
<br />
Would like verification and/or explanation

<p><span>Hi crane2:
</span></p>
<p><span>Well, I’ll explain then, the KB971033 is a part of Windows® Activation Technologies, the Windows® Genuine Advantage (WGA). Now this update gathers information
 and ensures that the Windows® product you’re using gets validated and activated over the web.
</span></p>
<p><span>The KB915597 is a definition update for Windows® Defender, AFAIK, it is critical and shall be installed,
<br />
but I do not have clear information about the KB-update yet. </span></p>

            <p>Consider an OS like a kid and the computer hardware the kid's toys. If there is only one kid, then that kid can easily decide which toys the kid will use. If you introduce a second kid into the equation, you now need to have some "mechanism" to decide which
 toys which kid can play with. If you put one kid in the room with the toys and lock the other kid in a second room without the toys, then this is like the dual boot option. If you have a "dominate kid" (i.e. say a big brother) that basically gets to decide
 which toys that kid will play with and which toys the "subordinate kid" will play with, then that is like running a primary OS with a secondary OS running in a virtual machine. If you have two kids with no mechanism to decide who gets to play with which toy,
 then the kids fight over the toys.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is that you have to have SOMETHING that decides which OS gets access to what computer resources. This is the primary purpose of an OS...it allocates/grabs computer resources and decides which programs, etc get what resources. So, you have to have
 either only one OS or you have to have a dominate OS that decides this. The dual boot option is basically having one OS running at a time. Thus, that one OS decides which programs get the resources. In the case of a virtual machine, you will have a primary
 OS that ultimately "doles" out the resources and it is the virtual machine software that puts in requests for resources for the secondary OS to use. Think of the virtual machine as the ambassador/intermediary to the primary OS from the secondary OS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only other way would be for some very rudamentary OS to be running that then allows multiple OSs to run on top of it. This would be much like the virtual machine option, but the rudamentary OS would ONLY be about doling out resources. I am not aware of
 any such system for a desktop environment.<br />

<br />unfortunately Surface's license is tied to Surface itself and cannot be transferred to another PC. You may upgrade your home edition to Pro for ~$100 in Microsoft Store - see link on Activation page of Settings.

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Surface pro license can't be transferred to another computer.
<br />
<br />For your Office computer, You don't need a full license but you need to pay a differential cost of $99.99.
<br />
<br />Follow the process below to accomplish this -

<h2>            Want to add &#34;Open With&#34; to right click</h2>
                    <p>I first googled the problem and looked at the suggestions by "windows club" but their example did not match what I saw in my window 10 registry.&nbsp; I then tried searching for what their example showed, but there seemed to be hundreds of "shellex" and I gave
 up trying to search for the correct one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When right clicking&nbsp; a batch file in "File Explorer"&nbsp; I see "open, edit, print,,.."&nbsp; Edit brings up notepad.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I also have to awkwardly "confirm I want to run the program" even though I selected "edit" and not run BUT THAT IS ANOTHER PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to open the batch file in wordpad, not notepad for editing or viewing.&nbsp; Seems that "batch file"&nbsp; ports from Linux don't look good in notepad but are formatted just fine in wordpad.&nbsp; I would like to avoid associating batch file with wordpad as I then
 lose notepad, and really want to add the "open with" or "edit with" option instead, or in addition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently (on my system), XML file can be opened with Notepad, Wordpad, Visual Studio, etc.&nbsp; which works out fine.&nbsp; Just problem with batch file not having those options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking!</p>

<h2>            Best practice in configuring a standard Desktop Configuration&#47;settings...</h2>
                    
<p><span>I need to configure a training room with approx. 10 workstations with a standard operating system (i.e. XP Pro)&nbsp;and MS application suite (Office 2007 Suite). After every training
 session the&nbsp;workstations need to return to the original configuration/settings.&nbsp;Do I use&nbsp;SCCM to redeploy the desktop image after each session or is there another option which will permit the desktops to revert back to the original setting or is there a group
 policy that will meet this requirement?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you!!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 Driver for Canon i9100 Printer</h2>
                    <p>When I try to install my Canon i9100 printer on my HP laptop running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit, Windows cannot locate a driver. &nbsp;Visiting the Canon website, I find an update module for the Windows driver. &nbsp;Canon says the printer MUST be installed using
 Windows Updater before their driver update can be installed. &nbsp;I have tried everything, but I cannot get Windows to find a driver. &nbsp;Windows Updater says that my computer is Up To Date.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

</p><blockquote>I am also not able to install the necessary Microsoft drivers to connect my Canon i9100 printer. &nbsp;Can you direct me to the appropriate driver site? &nbsp;I have a windows 7 64 bit operating system.
</blockquote>
<p>When Canon says that "<span>Your printer must be installed via Microsoft Update before you download and use this module," that does not mean that you need to run Windows Update (or Microsoft Update).&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>The advice from the Support Engineer is not correct:&nbsp; <span>Windows Update will not find a new driver for a device that is not yet installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A,&nbsp; Normal Method</strong></p>
<p><span>What the message means is that y</span>our computer needs to be connected to the Internet when you attempt to install the Canon i9100.&nbsp; When you connect the printer, Windows should search for a driver.&nbsp; When it can't find a driver locally, you should
 get a pop up message asking for permission to connect to Windows Update to search for a driver.&nbsp; You should allow this.&nbsp; Windows should then find the driver online, download it, and complete the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you can obtain the driver in one of two ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>B.&nbsp; Manually through Windows Update.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect the printer from the computer<br />
</li><li>Click Start &gt; Devices and Printer</li><li>Click "Add a local printer"</li><li>Click "Use an existing port" and leave the default of LPT1, then click Next<br />
</li><li>Select Canon in the list of manufacturers</li><li>Confirm that there is no entry for the i9100 in the list of printers and then click the "Windows Update" button</li><li>Wait ... this may take quite a while ... when it's done, confirm that the i9100 is now listed<br />
</li><li>Cancel out of the printer install wizard<br />
</li><li>Connect the printer to a USB port and it should now install properly<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp; From the Windows Update Catalog</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the above methods should work, you can also got to <a href="https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx</a> <strong>using Internet Explorer only</strong> and search for "Canon i9100".&nbsp; You should get 5 hits.&nbsp; Click on each of the drivers that are for Windows 7.&nbsp; Look at the line that says "Architecture."&nbsp;
 If you have Windows 7 32-bit, you need the x86 version.&nbsp; If you have Windows 7 64-bit, you need the AMD64 version.&nbsp; The procedure for installing a driver obtained this way is a bit complex.&nbsp; If methods A or B don't work, post back for additional instructions.</p>

<p>SRX randomizes source ports on source NAT to counter DNS poisoning attacks (among other things). This confuses XBL.</p>
<p>"set security nat source port-randomization disable" doesn't help. <br />
You need to create a source NAT pool containing your public IP address and set "port no-translation" in the pool.</p>
<p>This worked for me to get Open NAT on a SRX100H running Junos 12.1X44-D40.2.</p>
<p>Unless you have a static IP you'll probably want a SLAX script to update the config whenever your public IP changes.</p>

<p>MSE is very unlikely to be the cause of a BSOD so it is good to test for stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some folks are compelled to run something else because they heard/read it was better, they paid for it or in some environments are forced to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after that something else you have crashes you can always go back to the stable environment and see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can figure out "I never have a crash with MSE" or "I sometimes have crashes with Avast and when I switch back to MSE I never have crashes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your BSOD dump looked like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/735a971c-d759-404d-976c-d0986cb3a2dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/735a971c-d759-404d-976c-d0986cb3a2dc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks might say "ntoskrnl.exe is the cause of the crash (or win32k.sys, etc.)" but those are core Windows system files so if there was a problem with ntoskrnl.exe millions of systems all over the world would be crashing and they're not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third party analyzers like WhoCrashed and BlueScreeenView may/will also often implicate core Windows system files as the cause but they are wrong about as often as they might be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it is useful to look at several crash dump files for a pattern of failure and you only have one so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywho, if there are more crashes you can upload the crash dumps and somebody can take a look at them.</p>

    <title>STOLEN ACCOUNT - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acquittedpeak43  say:</h3>
<h2>            STOLEN ACCOUNT - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>
                    
<p>My account was stolen 3 weeks ago (this account that I am posting from is not the account).&nbsp; Over $250 in fraudulent charges were made to my credit card.&nbsp; A card that I HAD EXPLICITLY TOLD A C/S AGENT A WEEK PRIOR TO REMOVE FROM MY ACCOUNT.&nbsp; I have had to
 struggle with the bank to get the charges refunded, take time off work to do so, and currently have no access to content and services that I have bought and currently pay for.</p>
<p>The initial breach to my account was through EA Games.&nbsp; My email address was changed on their system.&nbsp; From there - the culprit was able to hook in to my XBOX Live account as the charges started not even 24 hours after this took place.&nbsp; MY ACCOUNT BEING
 HACKED IS A RESULT OF A SECURITY BREACH THROUGH EA / XBOX - NOT AS A RESULT OF ME BEING PHISHED DIRECTLY OR GIVING OUT PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p>I have now had 4 calls in to XBOX support - each time escalating my call, with no resolution and little sympathy.</p>
<p>I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR OVER 5 YEARS.&nbsp; I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS ON GAMES, SERVICES, AND CONTENT IN THAT TIME.&nbsp; WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT TO RESTORE MY ACCOUNT AND PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION?&nbsp; THERE ARE ZERO UPDATES AS TO THE STATUS OF
 THIS ISSUE AS APPARENTLY THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT IS SO CLANDESTINE AND SECRETIVE, THE C/S DEPT HAS NO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM AND WILL NOT PROVIDE ME WITH FURTHER CONTACT INFORMATION.</p>
<p>MY ACCOUNT SHOULD BE RESTORED IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; THE "INVESTIGATION PROCESS" THAT APPARENTLY NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE MY ACCOUNT IS RESTORED IS NOT
<strong>MY PROBLEM</strong>.&nbsp; THIS IS <strong>YOUR PROBLEM</strong>.&nbsp; THERE IS NO REASON WHY MY ACCOUNT CANNOT BE RESTORED WHILE THIS PROCESS TAKES PLACE.&nbsp; WHY IS A LOYAL CUSTOMER THAT HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG BESIDES TRUST IN YOUR SERVICE BEING PUNISHED FOR
 A BREACH IN XBOX LIVE SECURITY?&nbsp; IT MAKES NO SENSE.&nbsp; ANY NORMAL BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE IN THIS WAY.&nbsp; IF YOUR C/S DEPARTMENT HAD REMOVED MY CARD FROM THE ACCOUNT LIKE I HAD ASKED FOR - NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.&nbsp; ONCE AGAIN - YOUR PROBLEM, NOT MINE.</p>

<p>You must wait while they do the investigation. I know it is frustrating but they wont give you the account back straight away because they need to check that you are you, and the events have taken place as you've said.<br />
<br />
Would you really want them to give accounts 'back' without checking people are the genuine owner?<br />
<br />
I certainly hope you are complaining to EA as well, as it is them from your story that lead to this situation.<br />
<br />
One last thing, even if the person had your email address they would still have needed your password to take the account. Please tell me you didn't have the same one for EA and your 360 account?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no idea what my EA games password was. &nbsp;If fact - I do not recall even setting up an account with them. &nbsp;I believe my XBL account was linked into their services due to certain games I had played requiring you to provide your email address to them.</p>

<p>NOT TRUE. &nbsp;On all accounts. &nbsp;I wont even bother arguing my usage of the term "troll" - we'll just move on.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight - we provide information to XBOX LIVE which is then either shared directly or indirectly with their partners. &nbsp;We do so under the assumption that we are subscribing to a secure and reliable service. &nbsp;This information is then obtained
 by a fraudulent user via some loop hole in their systems. &nbsp;Explain to me how this is my fault? &nbsp;My password strength was not good enough? &nbsp;My email address was provided and valid? &nbsp;As stated above - if you google these issues, you can find clear as day evidence
 of various spoofs that can be used to obtain information in order to hack an account. &nbsp;This has NOTHING to do with the security of individual accounts on the user end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen, I'm not a kid. &nbsp;And I have worked in the IT field for several years. &nbsp;Your personal account is absolutely irrelevant. &nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that XBL rep accounts are under a different level of security than a standard user. &nbsp;If you have proven
 anything to me - it is that once again, an instance of an XBL rep not supporting their customer base appropriately and shirking responsibility.</p>

<p>Just because we have little symbols under our names, doesn't make us Xbox reps.&nbsp; In fact we are not affiliated with Microsoft in any way other than&nbsp;being Xbox owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scams, phishing and the like&nbsp;aren't the same as 'hacking'.&nbsp; Also as far as I am aware there no security issues with EA, if there were I'm sure I would be aware of them.&nbsp; I've also been a EA member since 1999 and have never had any problems with them.&nbsp; If
 EA had been compromised it would be all over the news. No one is going to hack them just to get your account.</p>

<p>I am *very* aware of what the difference is. &nbsp;And yes - there is a breach in EA / XBL. &nbsp;Again - if you google these facts, you will find plenty of evidence that this is taking place. &nbsp;Just because there is no public acknowledgement of such does not mean
 it is not happening. &nbsp;No company wants to admit these flaws as it undermines the integrity of their service. &nbsp;But wait, let me guess, you are probably in a way referring to the latest PSN breach. &nbsp;This was only admitted because it was a one time, isolated
 hack of epic proportions and they had no choice but to admit fault.</p>
<p>What is so difficult about admitting to this? &nbsp;Apparently the normal business motto does not hold true with XBL. &nbsp;At XBL - "the customer is always wrong".</p>

<p>As stated above - if you google these issues, you can find clear as day evidence of
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">What makes you think "we" don't Google these things like everyone else does. lol sorry but I know how to use my Internet for basic Information. And I'm also aware that there are thousands upon misinformed Users and Information
 on the Internet as well. <br />
<br />
You yourself state the Truth. That's exactly what all of those are, both "spoofs" and a Method of either

<br />
Third Party Companies do not have any Information in regards to your Windows Live ID via XBL, unless the User provides it for them. Xbox LIVE does not transmit in anyway a Users WLID to any 3rd Party Companies or otherwise. It is at the sole responsibility
 of the User to Protect their Account Information.</span></p>
<p>[quote user="AcquittedPeak43"]Listen, I'm not a kid. &nbsp;And I have worked in the IT field for several years. &nbsp;Your personal account is absolutely irrelevant. &nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that XBL rep accounts are under a different level of security than a
 standard user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">First, I never stated anything of the like that you were a "kid". You are simply misinformed in regards to Account Security. If you truly have worked in the IT Field, you would know people attack Systems through the weakest link,
 other Users, not directly against any System itself</span>.<br />

            Sorry to bother anyone.&nbsp; I just didn't look long enough for an answer.&nbsp; After posting the above, I did a site search for the "Not enough..." message and found a lot more entries.&nbsp; One of those entries required modifying the Registry to include an IRPStackSize
 entry with a value of 50.&nbsp; None of my machines had an IRPStackSize entry in the registry (perhaps it used a default value of 15 as one person submitter).&nbsp; Anyway, with the new entry, everything now works again.

<p>They took UMK3 off because Midway went under. Not because they planned on releasing all classic titles later. No license meant no way to distribute it legally at the time.</p>
<p>I don't find 3 games for 800 points a bad deal at all, either. Totally going to be snatching them up when they get released.</p>

<p>They already said the price is set, its 800 MS points.. &nbsp; the deal has been made my warner Bros. and microsoft for that price on live for all 3.... &nbsp;and in addition to the other poster talkin bout them takin down Ultimate MK 3, all Midway games were taken
 off of Live and the other network because of them folding like it was said already... so you cant get any midway game now because of their fallout</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong><span>Hey guys I have a really annoying problem. I have read about it&nbsp;on-line&nbsp;as other people seem to have experienced it but there is no real definitive answer. On rare occasions, my mouse will act funny. When you press the
 left button, it will act as the right, and the right button will continue to act as the right one. When you go into the mouse settings, even if you swap them around it still acts like there's two right clicks and no left click buttons. I have tried a number
 of suggestions from elsewhere on the web including re-booting my pc several times, trying to update windows, disabling the mouse, re-installing, using a different mouse etc.. no matter what I do the problem persists.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The only way to get the mouse back to normal is either to turn the pc off and leave it a few hours, in which case sometimes even that does not work. The only other time it rectifies itself is on its own. Sometimes it will
 just correct itself without you doing anything to it.<br />
<br />
I will be very thankful for any advice anyone can give. Has anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know anything at all about it? Thanks<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>Do you remember making any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>You may follow these suggestions:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><span>Restart Volume Shadow Copy service and check if the issue persists, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type “<b>services.msc</b>” (without quotes) and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Locate and right-click "<b>Volume Shadow Copy</b>" service.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the <span>
Volume Shadow Copy </span>service, and then click <b>Stop</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the <span>
Volume Shadow Copy</span> service, and then click <b>Start</b>.</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: if you restart Volume shadow services all restore points will be deleted.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>

<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails
<span>run System File Checker tool and check for missing or corrupted files. Follow the steps in the link:</span></p>
<p>“How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p><b>Method 4</b>:</p>
<p>If the issue still occurs, restart computer in clean boot and check if any third party application is causing issue. F<span>ollow “step 1” in
 the link to enable to clean boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Skyrim Download Error</h2>
                    
<div>I just bought Skyrim for $30 on demand and used Microsoft Points, then I tried to download it, I get a "Download error" with no code just an error! I've downloaded the game before when I transferred my brother's Xbox profile to my console because my brother
 bought the game, but when I downloaded Skyrim to my console it wouldn't work. I deleted Skyrim on my storage then like I said I bought the game then&nbsp;</div>
<div>tried to dowload it, but I always get an error.</div>

<div>My connection is really slow, but I tried to download a 400mb game and it was still downloading slow.. Skyrim is 3gb+ so is that the prolem? My connection is too slow?</div>
<div>Or my Xbox is just glitching because I downloaded it before, then I bought it?</div>

<div>Also, I just moved to a different country</div>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hello NO TURTLE BEACH,</span><br />
<br />
I hope I can help you out with some info that you don't waste time on standard copy-paste "by the book" answers:
<br />
<br />
<strong>First, important question: Do you get an error message or an error code?</strong><br />
Or does it just restart and it is like my personal Bethesda SKYRIM problem:</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/t/1422551.aspx</p>
<p>So iot safe you some annoying "trial and ERROR" time, my conclusions <strong>what DOES NOT work</strong> to resolve your problem:</p>
<p>*Mixed up XboxLive/physical IP issues (migrating might just bring more issues,
<strong>account migration sometimes does NOT work</strong> as advertised), read through the forums, many report problems like this
<strong>even with MATCHING, never ever changed, physical IP and XboxLive regions</strong>;<br />
*try to download several times, all hours of the day, different days;<br />
*check free HDD space;<br />
*WIFI download speed;<br />
*clear System cache;<br />
*delete Microsoft Live Marketplace cache;<br />
*delete ALL old Skyrim install files and traces of old Skyrim;<br />
*try a different external &gt;4GB USB flash drive, eliminating the possibility of a hardware HDD fault;<br />
*delete and re-downloaded the profile;<br />
*Contact Bethesda (They have nothing to do with the problem, since it is hosted by Microsoft servers!);</p>
<p>I quote Don MATTRICK, Microsoft: <em>"fortunately, we have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity, it's called Xbox 360."</em> So, also to my experience, Microsoft Xbox consoles work best
<strong>offline</strong>. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Good side:</span> So to avoid frustration, offline good old single-player is how you should see your Microsoft Xbox. One thing I must say I
<strong>don't really use the online "features"</strong> too much anyways and also enjoy the good old single-player offline contents!<br />
<br />
NO TURTLE BEACH, <strong>I hope this helps to avoid valuable time spent in vain</strong> solving your problem and at some point in the future Microsoft will solve or acknowledge all these issues.</p>

<p>umm migration has always had the warning that region locked content will infact not work in a new region you will.need a new purchase</p>
<p>did you not read the warning?</p>
<p>the only thing migration doesis allow you to a new region because you moved and due to distibution laws region locked content dont transfer between regions</p>
<p>without losing your gamesaves</p>
<p>you forfeit any download rights of any region locked content when you migrate</p>

<p><span>Cool, kid. Can I have that in writing? True, migration always had this suspicious connotation to it. And why should you, anyways?<br />
<br />
But low and behold, Microsoft even has a free-of-charge solution for the disobedient leaving-the-country XboxLive customer: Gifting you the
<strong>feature</strong> to <strong>purchase a new extra version of Bethesda's Skyrim for each country</strong> poor you is forced to work or migrate in! Wowzers, that's 'sumpin of a service, Microsoft - thank you so much! I'll purchase 'em in a cheap heap
 then: Any "3 for 2" Skyrim bundles 'round in the next PX? And I can just imagine the fun of havin' conflictin' Skyrim digital download versions on my HDD: That might be even more entertaining than actually playing:
<strong>I'll get my popcorn and beer and just lean back and watch my Xbox going nuts! :-D</strong><br />

If you know someone with the same style of console, you can just bring your hard drive and use it on their console. If not, can you use your console and hard drive on a different internet connection?<br /><br />If you can try either of those, what results does it yield?<br /><br />Let us know and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<p>@Mister Cerb I downloaded Skyrim with my brother's account who had the game for free in my console. I deleted my brother's account on my console and Skyrim since it still wouldn't let me play in my own profile. Then, I bought the game with my own profile,
 but now it won't download.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am in the Philippines now and not much people here have Xbox 360s... I tested my internet connection..</p>
<p>(PING - 80 ms) (Download speed - 1.00mbps) (upload speed - 1.00+ mbps) internet here is slow..

<h2>            Skype Hacked</h2>
                    So tried to log onto Skype, password not working, even tho I'd logged on 30 mins before. Try to recover password, turns out the recovery email has also been changed to a throw away account. Fill out the recovery form, get email back not enough details
 to recover account even tho I filled out every answer, tried again, same result, now I'm locked out of trying to recover it. Try live chat with support to help, that doesn't work, I just want to get access to my account that has my Skype credit on so I can
 phone home. A hacker can change is easily but it seems impossible for me to get it back, seriously?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/17bae8b1-20b5-4c18-af31-5e7b965f6f10" title="Gwymp">
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best recourse I would strongly recommend you to do would be to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I suggest that you create a new account
 instead.</p>

<h2>            An &#34;Error Status 0xc0000020&#34; keeps on appearing when i am downloading Razer Synapse 3</h2>
                    I am trying to install the Razer Synapse 3 and every time I install it, half way through the installation an error message always appears with the window named "vc_redist.x86.exe - Bad Image". Within the window it says "C:\Windows\System32\MSISIP.DLL is
 either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0xc0000020."<br />

            Hi,  GianRP
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.       
        </p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the computer works fine in safe mode, the cause of the issue might be any of the third party application or the antivirus software might be causing
 the issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Did you follow the second step in the above post to disable the services and try re-enabling them in groups to identify the problem application?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If not follow the complete article and check what is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, try disabling the antivirus software temporarily and check if that is interfering in the process. To disable the antivirus follow the link
 given below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other
 security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the
 time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
