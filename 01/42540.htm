<h2>            Starthelp.exe at startup</h2>
                    <p>Original title: starthelp.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently been noticing a pop-up on booting my computer that asks if I'd like to install "starthelp.exe".&nbsp; I never clicked "install", and have restored my computer to about a month ago, in hopes it would make it go away.&nbsp; Outside of restoring to factory
 settings, I was wondering if anyone else knows anything about this and the best way to remove it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
My research suggests this is a virus/malware/trojan horse, but, then again, I don't usually trust most sites, if they are touting how bad this thing can be because most are telling me to reboot into safe mode and go to websites, install software that will remove
 this problem, etc....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone out there think they have an answer?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you remember making any hardware or software changes to the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. What is the complete error message that you receive?</p>
<p>3. Do you have an anti-virus program installed on the PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 1: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">First, I would suggest you to<font><strong>

<p><font color="#000000"><br />
<br />
</font></p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Also, as you are getting this message at startup, I would suggest you to place the computer in a Clean Boot state to know why startup program is causing this&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font><br />
To help troubleshoot issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</font></font></span></p>

            <p>Hi Santosh_Rai</p>
<p>
</p><p>30 July 2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never been able to get windows 10 preview beta to install correctly</p>
<p>I am running as admin.</p>
<p>I kept getting "Not a Valid ISO File" errors</p>
<p>Installing from USB stick properly configured it would crash during install returning no error codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the 29 July release is downloadable I am trying to download and install as admin. to install on a USB stick to a different computer using the "Windows 10 Media Creation Tool"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running "Windows 10 Media Creation Tool" on Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit service pack 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Choose "Create Installation Media for another PC"</p>
<p>I set the language to English (US)</p>
<p>Then I choose "Windows 10 Home"</p>
<p>Then I choose 32 Bit (X86)</p>
<p>Then I choose "USB Flash Drive"</p>
<p>Then I refresh the drive list to verify the USB drive is seen</p>
<p>Then I press next and one of two failure modes commences</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the download appears to be occurring counting up from "0%" to "99%"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over about 90 minutes download period, followed by "Verifying download"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at "0%' for about two minutes then suddenly jumping to "90%" verified, then
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within two more seconds the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool crashes,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly, disappearing entirely from the screen and with no error message,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with&nbsp; any downloaded data gone&nbsp; Very disheartening and a big wasted</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time sink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Occasional the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool just crashes right after I
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verify the USB drive list and then press next, returning the error message</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something Happened" with no clue as to what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, </p>
<p>If I boot from windows 7 SP1 in "safe mode with networking,"&nbsp; (as ADMIN), THEN:</p>
<p>IN every case irrespective if I specify USB or ISO as the desired output configuration, when i press the "Next" button just before the download would normally begin, then the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool just crashes immediately, returning the error message
 "Something Happened" with no clue as to what. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should mention that since September of 2014, when Windows Update loaded some defectively designed updates, into my windows 7 Home Premium SP1, my computer has been very unstable, and will not reliably update at all; so any attempt to rely on windows update
 to upgrade to windows 10 appears to be a waste of time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did have a help ticket in with windows 7 Support from September through&nbsp; October 2014, and spent countless hours re-installing&nbsp; Windows 7 SP1 over and over again at Microsoft's request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After windows-7 went off warranty support in November 2014 I was then left without a solution despite the fact that may September 2014 help ticket problem was left unresolved, and my system was left unstable and with dysfunctional update capability by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each case&nbsp; stability was restored after the re-install, but then, as the hundreds of "required" "KB-xxxxx Updates" were installed, the operating system instability gradually returned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even purchased an additional copy of Windows-7 SP1 at the insistence of Microsoft that some files&nbsp; must be bad on my original install CD's.
</p>
<p>The result was still just the same with the "new" install discs... as the hundreds of "required" "KB-xxxxx Updates" were installed, the operating system instability gradually returned.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hopping that a clean install of windows 10 will result in a stable operating system without all the instability that has resulted as windows 7 Home premium accumulated way too many hastily designed, but conflicting, update patches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide some&nbsp;effective simple way to allow the many users who's update functions have simply failed due to too many conflicting updates, to upgrade to windows 10 without relying on either previously installed updates, or an online installation processes,
 or the apparently dysfunctional&nbsp; Windows 10 Media Creation Tool&nbsp; until it is fixed,&nbsp; or the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because my windows 7 SP1 has been left dysfunctional with respect to updates since the dubious updates released last fall, i show no windows 10 upgrade reservation logo on my system tray either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this detailed report will help Microsoft resolve the many remaining issues with allowing users to easily install Windows 10 upgrades by easily and&nbsp; successfully using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Best Regards,</p>

            I am having this problem as well, but my windows update is stuck on an AMD driver that is repeatedly failing and also has error&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x80070103, then&nbsp;</span>once in a while a windows defender
 update that comes and goes. &nbsp;Then when I try running the media creation tool it is crashing with a SoftModem error or something after completing the creating media phase. Is there any way to make Windows Update not give me AMD updates? I have been doing these
 drivers myself and using the AMD Beta drivers for a while now. Also, I went manually into the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Downloads folder and ran the installer from there and then tried updating the graphics driver through Device Manager pointed to said
 location (which told me that my driver was already up to date), then cleared the Updates Cache and Windows 10 is still trying and failing to download this AMD update.

            <p>Thank you for letting us know the result Verdie. Since this issue happened right after Creators Update, we suggest that you delete the update first. Once done, let us perform the Media Creation Tool on your Windows 10. This will help refresh the system further.
 For detailed instructions, please check this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. After this, we can reinstall the Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, please check if you can then generate a report on Device Performance &amp; Health feature.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and Cubase 7 Elements problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joecrud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Cubase 7 Elements problems</h2>
                    I have another laptop which I use solely for making music with Cubase 7 elements. It was working fine running on Windows 8.1 (which I greatly disliked) using an M-Audio Midisport Uno along with Focusrite's Scarlet Studio 2i2. After having Windows 10 basically
 forced onto my computer (which I didn't want), Things changed. <br />
I began having problems with the midi functions in Cubase. I also lost use of all VST Instruments.<br />
<br />
I've updated drivers. I've tried uninstalling Cubase and reinstalling it (because that's all Microsoft "support" could offer as a resolution.) I rolled back to&nbsp; Windows 8.1 (which I still greatly dislike). Now some Plugins have gone "missing", and the same
 things are still not working properly. I've contacted Cubase. They've been fairly patient in trying to help me with an issue that they basically had nothing to do with. However, no progress is being made.<br />
<br />
As much as I disliked Windows 8.1, at least my program worked fine on it before I was digitally accosted by Windows 10. I think I kind of hate Miscrosoft a little bit right now.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having these issues? Anyone have any ideas how to fix them?<br />

<p>I can't really answer that, as I'm not too familiar with such things. I can only tell you what I know, which is very little.<br />
<br />
I had to roll back to Windows 8.1 (which I thoroughly dislike).<br />
Then I had to uninstall, and reinstall Cubase 7 Elements, then reinstall all the updates for that. There were some other things the tech had to do remotely to get things working properly that I'm really not too sure about.
<br />
</p>
<p>I do know that it was lot of trouble for something that was basically forced upon me. Also, Microsoft could probably learn a lot about customer service from the folks over at&nbsp;Steinberg/Yamaha.

<h3> ddaddysupreme  say:</h3>
<h2>            My &#34;Pen and Ink&#34; recognition won&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    <p>One or two letters weren't being recognized with my handwriting, so I decided to give Windows more samples to recognize it. When I click "Improve recognition" in the settings, then go to "Target specific recognition errors" and "Character or word you specify,"
 I type any letter or number and it says "Unsupported character," as shown in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>It was working less than an hour ago, and I had already improved recognition multiple times today. Strangely enough, I can still write into text fields, and they are recognized as being English. And before anyone asks, yes, I have already restarted my computer.
 My Windows 10 version is 1803 and I have a Dell Inspiron 2 in 1</p>

            Hi  DDaddySupreme
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could you try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1809 to see if this is fixed or improved?
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />

<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?

<p>Sorry about the time it took for me to respond. Today (5/02/2019) I had my computer update through the settings, and it did not fix the problem. It still says 1803 though, so I suppose it did not upgrade fully. I've had some problems with big windows updates
 in the past, and this isn't something I need to be fixed ASAP, so I am going to wait and upgrade it further at some other time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide some more information, I did not shut down, restart, or even close my computer between when it was and was not working. I had given it information on how I write, tested it in Google Chrome, and realized it had still not fixed recognition errors
 with the letter Y so I went to configure it again. All features still work except for the "target specific recognition errors" option. Because of this, I don't believe that updating would be the only solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Spanish (Mexico) language and tested the recognition with that, and it did work. That did not, however, fix English. It seems like the English language on my system, or the stored information on my handwriting is somehow corrupted. I'm going
 to try deleting English from my computer and reinstalling it, but I'll have to do that after my finals are done just in case it takes me some time to reverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to provide as much information as possible: My computer is a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 model 7573. The pen I am using is the "Dell active stylus" with 2 side buttons that came with it at Best Buy. I did not connect the open through Bluetooth or anything,
 so it is not listed in my devices. According to the "System information" app, I am running version 10.0.17134 build 17134. I don't know the exact version without restarting, which I'll have to do another time, but I believe my BIOS is up to date. If it's important
 let me know, but it was the same version when it was and was not working so I don't think it's that. Because I know it can cause problems sometimes, I have McAfee Livesafe version 16.0 R18 and McAfee Security Center version 17.8.131 which came installed on
 my computer.</p>

<h2>            Win 8 stuck in a loop We couldnt complete the updates undoing changes</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has win 8/8.1. I recently updated it but it didn't take it. Now every time I turn on the computer, it is stuck on a blue screen with "We couldn't complete the updates undoing changes Don't turn off your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is not set up to enable the F8 so I tried some times to hit F8 but it didn't enter safe mode. I don't have a recovery USB. I have a win 10 install usb but my win 8 has not been upgraded so I am afraid that if I install clean then I won't be
 able to activate it. I wonder if I should use it instead of a win 8 recovery usb to boot and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to get the hard drive out. There are various partitions on it, a winrestore partition and a PBR partition. I wonder if I can activate the restore process by activing this partition or just try to boot to it. I made an image of the drive so I'm not
 concerned with files, but just being about to upgrade to win 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have a record of what update I was installing. The thing is, I can't get pass the undoing update screen so none of your suggestions work. All of them requires me to log on and do something. I can't get to log on, upon start, I get that undoing update
 message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get a win 8 recovery ISO file so I can at least recover?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A MS helpdesk person I was chatting with gave me a link to a win 8.1 ISO. I hope after I download it (slow connection large file = hours to a day to download), I can install win 8.1 over win 8. Then upgrade to win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other computers but just don't have any recovery media for this one (my mom's computer).</p>

            <p>Your inbox may have become corrupt.&nbsp; You need to move all the messages from the inbox that you can and then close OE and delete the inbox.dbx file or move it to another directory.&nbsp; OE will then create a new inbox.&nbsp; Alternatively you can go to File | Identities
 and set up a new Identity and add your mail account there.&nbsp; That will give you a clean message store and then, if that works okay, then you can use File | Import | Messages to get the messages from the older Identity.&nbsp;

            <p>Are you sure that error message is not 0x800co<strong>1</strong>33?</p>
<p>Your Inbox has become corrupt due to allowing it to become bloated and/or lack of compacting.
</p>
<p><br />
1: View | Current View. Is Show All Messages checked?</p>
<p>2: If yes to #1, see if you have an Inbox.bak file in the Windows Recycle Bin and if so, what is the date created?</p>
<p>3: If Yes to 1 and 2, post back before you do anything else.</p>
<p>4: If Yes to #1 and No to #2, you will need a tool to retrieve the lost messages if you want them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the Inbox.dbx and&nbsp;rename it to Inboxold.dbx.&nbsp; A new Inbox will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>Then you will need a tool to run on the Inboxold.dbx file.</p>
<p><strong>DBXtract</strong> (Will <u>not</u> retrieve any messages after compacting)<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXtract/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXtract/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>DBXpress</strong> {much faster for large files and can retrieve messages after compacting in Extract From Disk mode}<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a>&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General precautions for Outlook Express:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

    <title>Why Have I Been Party Chat Banned&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chilling eff3ct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Have I Been Party Chat Banned&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was playing in a party with friends and I got a random message from Microsoft telling me that I had a "Notice of enforcement action"&nbsp;okay?? So now I can't chat with anyone in my party and it gives me a message " Your privacy settings prevent chat with some people". Judging by related posts it looks like I may have been chat banned? If I have its because I got a message from some kid telling me to go ***** myself after a game of gears. I usually don't respond but this kid was annoying so I told him to kiss my ****. Have I seriously been banned for this? I've had xbox live for 7 years and have never had an issue like this. I am an adult after all playing rated M games, so if we seriously cant even mess around with kids shi.t talking without being banned than maybe I should explore PC or Playstation. I am VERY&nbsp;disappointed and annoyed. Can somebody explain to me why ive gotten this message?</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have a lenovo laptop running win 7 64 bit. since I have had it the authenticaiton tab is missing. never really worked it since I ran wireless all the time. I now have a need to run wired.</p>
<p>The wired and wireless services are running.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the connection in device manager. reboot. It rediscovered the connection but no authentication tab.</p>
<p>I updated the adapter driver with the latest version from lenovo (it was newer) no change.</p>
<p>At a loss. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step ??</p>

    <title>CTRL&#43;C is Not Working&#47;Disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hrockler  say:</h3>
<h2>            CTRL&#43;C is Not Working&#47;Disabled</h2>
                    
<p>Just CTRL+C is not working on my keyboard. It does not work in any program (which includes Word 2007, etc.)</p>
<p>I've tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The on-screen keyboard is able to CTRL+C fine. </li><li>If I remote access the computer, I can CTRL+C fine from the other computer. </li><li>There are no non-essential processes that could be blocking CTRL+C because I've tried it in Safe Mode, but it doesn't work, either.</li><li>I've run a system restore to a point where I thought it wasn't happening. That didn't work.</li><li>I've uninstalled, then re-discovered the keyboard from the device manager. That didn't work.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it just be the keyboard needs to be replaced or am I missing something else?<em>All</em> the other CTRL+ functions (V, Z, X) work perfectly fine.
<em>Just</em> CTRL+C.</p>

<p>I am also quite fracked-off with Windows update failures - tried several 100 times to fix it to no successful avail.&nbsp; If you purchased the computer pre-installed with genuine copy of MS packages, really very unhelpful if you are ever advised to re-install
 it!.&nbsp; Microsoft fix-it tool; disabling KB installs, Registry edits and turning off virus protection services did nothing for me as well as basic troubleshooting and CMD configurations/service-stop/start admin entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is simply out of date upgrading to say Win 10, similar problems arise with update services (witnessed hundreds times) on MS community boards!.&nbsp; Really&nbsp; stuck as to what to do unless pay out for an expensive desktop PC with Windows 10 pre-installed?.

<p>Hi Yes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely appalling that Windows 7 security updates <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">systemically fail
</span></strong>causing my Windows 7 system to generate <strong>'invalid genuine MS product key information'
</strong>and desktop-crashes - <strong>tried everything on the MS website to resolve it to no avail.</strong> &nbsp; My desktop PC came pre-installed with all genuine MS programs, now somewhat defunct as MS 10 has superceded 7 -
<em><strong>regardless of all troubleshooting options</strong></em>, including manual downloades of KB update packages; official MS CMD administrative commands - nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled extensively on my precise issue and appears that I am just one of many 1000's MS consumers to experience this very same MS issue.&nbsp; If you could
<em><strong>very kindly explain or offer a workable solution</strong></em> to my dillema shall be immensely very grateful, especially if it is a MS conclusive resolution to my individual situation.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are unable to use your Bluetooth Adapter and getting an Code 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Code 10 error is mainly related to hardware and device driver issues or due to compatibility issues between hardware and Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may try running the <strong>Windows Updates and install all the available updates</strong> including the optional driver and software updates.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">Windows Update: Frequently Asked Question</span></a>s</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and install the Bluetooth Audio device driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website and install in compatibility mode. Refer to the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To install the driver in Compatibility Mode.</strong><br />

<h2>            &#91;Xbox no Windows 10&#93; Problemas com o Editor de Avatar do Xbox &#91;Translation - &#91;Xbox on Windows 10&#93; Xbox Avatar Editor Issues&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Olá, pessoal, tudo bem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meu nome é Arthur Estigarribia, sou estudante universitário da Furg e usuário do Windows 10 (atualização de abril de 2018).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mais uma vez, estou enfrentando problemas, desta vez com o Xbox no Windows 10. Depois de algum tempo sem aparecer aqui (devido a problemas na faculdade), voltei para relatá-lo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fui experimentar hoje o novo editor de avatares do Xbox para o Windows 10 (disponível na Loja), mas deu o seguinte erro:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Não foi possível carregar seu avatar.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Algo deu errado. Não foi possível carregar seu avatar.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A mensagem não me mostrou código de erro algum, e mesmo tentando de novo (ou reiniciando o app ou o Windows) o erro persiste. Não pude tirar print porque não consegui colá-lo aqui.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meu notebook é um Acer Aspire, tem 8 GB de RAM e mais de 800 GB de espaço livre no HD (de um total de 1 TB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>O que será que está acontecendo? O serviço está realmente fora do ar, é incompatibilidade mesmo (embora meu PC tenha placa gráfica) ou é algum bug do app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Atenciosamente, Arthur Estigarribia.</p>
<p>Estudante da Matemática Aplicada da FURG.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hey, guys, how you doing?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My name is Arthur Estigarribia, I'm a university student at Furg and a Windows 10 user (April 2018 update).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Once again, I'm experiencing problems, this time with the Xbox on Windows 10. After some time without appearing here (due to problems in college), I came back to report it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I went to try today the new avatar Editor from Xbox for Windows 10 (available in the store) but gave the following error:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Could not load your avatar.<br />
Something went wrong. Could not load your avatar.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The message did not show me any error code, and even trying again (or restarting the app or Windows) the error persists. I couldn't get a print off because I couldn't glue it here.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My notebook is an Acer Aspire, has 8 GB of RAM and more than 800 GB of free space in the HD (out of a total of 1 TB).</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
I wonder what's going on. The service is really out of the air, is incompatibility even (although my PC has graphics card) or is it some bug of the app?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sincerely, Arthur Estigarribia.<br />
Applied mathematics student at Furg.</strong></p>

<p>Hello Danadrix. I can understand your frustration! Your problem could be due to an unseen scratch or chip on your disc. It can be annoying sometimes at how game discs are so fragile nowadays! Or it could be something within your console, usually when your
 console is unable to read your discs, it's an error with the scanning laser within. I had this happen with my old original Xbox.</p>
<p>Try following the steps here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../disc-drive-solution</a> </p>
<p>I hope it eventually starts working again!</p>

<p>i'd keep a close eye on it,sounds like it could be the lazer/disk reader starting to play up</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be the disc, or your xbox. The simple way to find this out is to play another game on your xbox. If the disc works, then it's not your xbox. If it's the disc, then it's a scratch or a chip that has happened, or you laser burned your disc.
 Laser burning your disc happens by moving your xbox while the disc is in and the xbox is on, I've done this to a Battlefield 3 disc before. You can always clean the disc, blow some air into your xbox, and give it another shot. Otherwise, it's probably a damaged
 disc, in this case, you should just pick up another copy of the game. If you have a warranty on the disc, &nbsp;you can get a replacement for free.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Loco.</p>

<p>I'm having same issue with Halo 4 disc. Played fine a few days ago, now it won't read. I went through trouble shooting and found it will play if I remove my HDD. I deleted the game off my HDD and deleted cache. Problem remains. I may just put my profile
 on an mem stik and play with HDD removed.</p>
<p>Xbox is a week old, and the HDD is from my last S model which the dvd drive died just over a year after I got it. So I picked up a 4GB model as it is the same price as it would cost to get it repaired, minus the shipping charges.
</p>

<p>Only way I can get Halo 4 to load is to remove the HDD while xbox is off. Once I turn it on, I don't sign in it will load. I tried to start game with HDD installed and not signing in but I get same error.
</p>
<p>My conclusion is that it is not the game disc, or DVD drive, or the HDD. I even deleted the game from my HDD and tried to start Halo 4, but I still get the disc unreadable error.</p>
<p>The pop up also states to clean the disc, (I did that) and also to restart my console. This did not work. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I solved my problem. The error was caused by the game update. I deleted it and the game started. But I could not play without logging back into XBL and download the update. The update is what caused the problem, and does so each time I delete and re-download
 the update. I do clear cache each time also and reboot the xbox. </p>

<h2>            Administrator issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have already asked but have not received a reply that helped - seems weird to me that Microsoft has not replied to my previous question as follows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to add or edit photos I now get a message that says to contact the administrator - I don't have permission to save to this file - I am the administrator - I have tried several things posted online so far and non of them are working to change this
 problem...</p>
<p>Their reply:</p>
<p><span><span>Hi Cathy, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the computer and then sign in to the Admin account to check if this helps. You may also check for any pending updates and install them to check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>
<p><span>My next reply:</span></p>
<p>I have already done that - I have also made sure I am all updated - I also did the other fixes suggested on previous users problems - there seems to be a lot of people with the same issue and non of them seem to have it resolved yet either.</p>
<p>I did some kind of Inheritance fix suggested and a restore health - neither fixed it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!! nothing is fixing this issue! I can sae to One Drive - but I don't want to - I want to save to my own pictures folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
