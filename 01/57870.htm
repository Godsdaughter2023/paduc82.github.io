                    <p>I have a Brother MFC-240C printer and Windows 8.1 Pro OS. I can't scan in PDF format. Brother says you can use Microsoft Fax and Scan. This feature doesn't offer PDF format. Is there a solution I've missed? Thank you</p>

            Scan does not mean using optical character recognition to correct errors in a document. Scan is using your scanner to copy any item in any format. In windows 8.1 it is called<strong> Windows fax and scan</strong>. Explain what you are trying to do with
 pdf files.&nbsp;

            When you scan a document in Windows 8.1 pro <strong>"Fax and Scan"</strong> feature you have a choice which format you want to use. As I previously mentioned,
<strong>Fax and scan</strong> feature does not offer pdf format as one of the other formats (e.g jpeg and others). I need to scan to pdf format. It's that simple.&nbsp;

            hi - did you ever find a way to scan to PDF? &nbsp;I'd love to use my MFC-240 for this purpose also but haven't figured out a way to make it happen.

            Yes, unfortunately, I did. &nbsp;My old Windows Vista computer died, so I had to buy a new computer. &nbsp;Windows 8. &nbsp;What I finally discovered is that the software in my Brother printer isn't compatible with Windows 8. &nbsp;It works terrific for copying and printing,
 but not scanning. &nbsp;I also lost my Windows Office as it was not longer compatible either. &nbsp;So, I had to buy a new printer and I'm paying every month for Office. &nbsp;Stinks!

            <p>I had this problem too. &nbsp;I tried downloading some PDF converter software but that didn't work for me. &nbsp;Then I checked the Brother website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the drivers and software (again) and followed the instructions on how to select scan, file, and save as a pdf.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also changed the destination to save in MyDocuments , which is where I need it to save.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Update Won&#39;t Load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaitlynwillis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Update Won&#39;t Load</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 8 computer has been acting weird after I updated it to 8.1 I believe. Windows Movie Maker does not recognize any of the files it used to recognize. My Google Chrome has been acting up tremendously and so has my files. But the worst part is that
 I cannot completely reset my computer to factory settings to fix this. When I try to reset it to factory settings, it just says, "No changes were made."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating and so now I have to see if updating my computer will fix any of this. My computer says that I am due for an update when I login, but when I go to</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Settings&gt;Windows Update &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update screen will load, load, and load and I will let it load for hours and hours, yet it doesn't stop loading. It never shows me the Update I need. Also, there is no error code for the update because it won't load at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating because I don't understand why I cannot reset my computer completely or Update it. I have researched for hours and hours to fix this and I have become irratible trying to fix the computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe all of this came from the Update and I cannot fix it. I have had many people try and fix it, but usually I am capable of fixing computers or looking up the answer to fixing it, but not this time around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ANYONE knows the solution to this problem, please don't hesitate to reply. I have grown tired of all these issues and I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I sign in to Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just recently bought a new laptop which came with Windows 10 pre-installed. And by new, I mean a mere few hours ago. I need to do a Skype interview tomorrow in less than 15 hours, and thus I had to set up Skype.</p>
<p>In Windows 10, it is said in the Skype Preview app that I could sign in with Microsoft Account. And so I did, until it said that 'There was a problem signing you in, please try again later'</p>
<p>That's it. Just like that.</p>
<p>I certainly did not forget my Microsoft Account ID and password, and it certainly wasn't compromised in any way, because I'm also checking my e-mails as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>I just. Had. To. Sign. In. Please.</p>

<br />1. Open NVidia Control Panel and choose Manage 3D settings
<br />2. Under Program Settings select Nox Player app and turn off Vertical Sync, Triple buffering and Threaded Optimization
<br />3. Exit NVidia Control Panel, relaunch the computer to check if the issue is fixed.

    <title>Razer Atrox for Xbox One unresponsive on Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Razer Atrox for Xbox One unresponsive on Windows 10.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;In the past few hours I received my Razer Atrox fightstick Xbox One edition and after unboxing and plugging it in it does not function in any usable way as a controller. I've looked on the official Atrox Xbox One page and it says that it does work on windows
 PC but it requires Beta Xbox One Controller Drivers. I am unsure of where to go for these beta drivers--or if they even exist anymore for that matter. After doing some more digging another post recommended that I just need the regular Xbox One drivers that
 come standard with Windows 10. However after several testing attempts nothing has yielded any results. Another post recommended that I use the Windows Store App that would recognize the fightstick and I could use it then. But after trying all of these I am
 utterly lost. Windows recognizes the device by name but it does not recognize any inputs that I give it in game. If anyone has any links or things that could help me it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have the same problem as you. &nbsp;I just purchased two of these for my Windows 10 PC and they don't work at all. &nbsp;I see the same problem being posted on reddit and other random forums. &nbsp;Some people have come up with a slight fix, but it leaves two of the
 buttons functionless.</p>
<p>I had contacted Xbox support and the guy on the phone was clueless as to why there is no support for the arcade sticks.</p>
<p>***This is straight from Razer's website:</p>
<p>Is the Razer Atrox for Xbox One compatible with a PC running Microsoft Windows? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The Razer Atrox for Xbox One can currently be used on Windows PCs with limited functionality. You’ll need to use the current Microsoft beta drivers for Xbox One controllers. &nbsp;However, at this time, Microsoft does not plan to have official drivers for Arcade
 Sticks and thus, Razer does not officially support the Atrox for Xbox One on Windows.
</p>
<p>Please Microsoft, Xbox One is your own invention. &nbsp;Please support this fight stick on Windows 10! &nbsp;I hear that PS4 arcade sticks have more support on windows 10. &nbsp;If you don't release a driver soon, it's going to teach me to never purchase Microsoft/approved
 products because they may not work.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner<br />
and their supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation <br />
and&nbsp; drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows (10, 8/8.1, 7, Vista, and XP)<br />

            Hello ana03,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you&nbsp; maybe experiencing excessive paging.&nbsp;If you don't have enough RAM to run Vista and any additional programs, then your computer uses your
 to consider adding more for your Vista to run smoothly. RAM is the easiest/cheapest way to upgrade&nbsp;the performance in your system.

<h2>            RPCRT4.dll and WS2_32.dlls are missing</h2>
                    <p>We upgraded a comp that we mostly use for online&nbsp;games&nbsp;to Windows 10 about 45 days ago.&nbsp; Programs were running ok&nbsp;until a few days ago.&nbsp; We now get two errors upon startup and/or when we try to start multiple apps/games like Skype, Origin, Minecraft, and

<p>
</p><p>The first error that appears is "The program can't start because RPCRT4.dll is missing from your computer.&nbsp; Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."&nbsp; I've looked around and the file is not in the recycle bin and&nbsp;I don't see any recent references
 to this driver since a Windows 7 Service Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next error that appears is "The program can't start because WS2_32.dll is missing from your computer.&nbsp; Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around in the support forums and don't see any recent (Windows 10) issues/fixes&nbsp;so I thought I'd try here.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Stuart, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I would like to inform you that most rpcrt4.dll and WS2_32.dll errors are related to missing or corrupt rpcrt4.dll and WS2_32.dll files. Because these are external files, it presents a great opportunity for something undesirable to occur.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Improperly shutting down your PC or getting a virus infection could corrupt the rpcrt4.dll, which could lead to DLL errors. When your rpcrt4.dll file becomes corrupt, it cannot be loaded properly and will present an error message.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Install any available Windows updates. These will replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The rpcrt4.dll and ws2_32.dll files could be included in one of those updates.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Follow the steps below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1. Click on search bar, type Windows Update.<br />
2. Select Check for Update.<br />
3. Download and Install the latest Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>I suggest you to run Microsoft safety scanner and check.
<br />
To perform Microsoft Safety Scanner please visit the below link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also I suggest you to disable anti-virus program, if installed on your computer and check.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Hope it helps. Revert to us with the results, will be happy to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
Thank you.</div>

            Thank you Mohan,<br />
<br />
There were no new updates avail for Windows 10.<br />
<br />
At first I had trouble running the Microsoft safety scanner.&nbsp; After downloading the software I received a message "this program cannot run on this PC" or something to that effect (I forgot to write it down).&nbsp; Maybe it had something to do with my inability to
 disable McAfee anti-virus program?&nbsp; &nbsp;After I restarted, I tried again and it downloaded and ran.&nbsp; I then performed a full scan and, after many hours, there were no viruses or malware detected.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess that's good but do you have any other suggestions about
 how to replace the missing or corrupt rpcrt4 and ws2_32 dlls.<br />
<br />
Thank,<br />
Stuart

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) and check if it helps.</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for file corruption and restore Windows system files such as rpcrt4.dll and WS2_32.dll. If System File Checker finds a problem with rpcrt4.dll
 or other critical system file, it will attempt to replace the problematic files from DLL Cache (%WinDir%\System32\Dllcache\).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow these steps to run the command and check if it helps.<br />
1. Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong> on the keyboard.<br />
2. Click on <strong><span>Command prompt (Admin).</span></strong><br />
3. Type <strong><span>sfc /scannow </span></strong>and hit <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists, I suggest you to <strong>
restore from a system restore point: </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring
 won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
1.&nbsp;<strong>Right-click </strong>(or press and hold) the <strong>Start </strong>button, and then select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Search <strong>Control Panel for Recovery</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next &gt; Finish</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<strong>Note: </strong><br />
If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, and then select Recovery &gt; Configure System Restore &gt; Configure and make sure Turn on system protection is
 selected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Revert to us with the results, will be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<p>Since yesterday my WhatsApp application has frozen and I can't shut it down. I tried it through the task manager and then via the cmd (with administrative privileges). How come an application cannot be closed even with the cmd?</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope&nbsp;you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they
 installed may also be cancelled.<span>&nbsp; </span>In some cases, this may be good.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to
 normal and the security is enabled or re-installed). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard
 drive).<span>&nbsp; </span>If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them).<span>&nbsp;
</span>There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have).<span>&nbsp;
</span>That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as
 high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.P.S. If you wish to report it and live in the United States, here are some links you can try:</span></p>

</span>This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases. I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or
 the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include
 them if I were harmed.</p>

<h2>            Video burned to disk won&#39;t play in DVD player</h2>
                    
<p>I have previously used Nero with Windows XP to burn DVD-R disks with the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders and files. They played fine on the PC and on my DVD player.</p>
<p>Now I have Windows 7 and have burned such a disk (with the CD/DVD player option) using the Windows Explorer burning option, the Windows Media Centre option and imgburn. In every case the DVD will play on my computer but not on my DVD player. The latter does
 not recognise the disk.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<h3> robertadams05  say:</h3>
<h2>            My administrator pin does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming Laptop with Windows 10 on it. I haven't had any problems with it since I got it, but recently I have been trying to open apps and files that require administrator permission with a pin. When I put in my pin, the computer
 says "Something happened and your pin isn't available."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything from Command prompt to resetting my pin, and none of these options work as they either require administrator permission (with a pin) to change the settings or I cannot find the software (I can't find the command prompt option after
 pressing Windows key + X).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've watched tutorials and looked on websites and tried everything but nothing works. Do you have any suggestions as to what I could do to get my pin working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Adams</p>

    <title>Xbox one Games freezing on Title Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxbeccabumxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one Games freezing on Title Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Black Flag a couple of weeks ago on the xbox store and I have super slow internet so it took days to install. I've had minecraft for a while as a digi download and it was working fine.</p>
<p>I usually play games for a couple of hours a night but I didn't use my xbox one much over the weekend except for Netflix and then when I turned it on Monday and tried to play Black Flag, when it gets to the title screen and says "press a" I do, but it goes
 to "loading saved game" and then flicks back to the "press a" screen. It does this in a loop, sometimes not even making it to trying to load saves before asking me to press A again. I rebooted the console but no change so I assumed it was a fault on their
 part and would be solved in time.</p>
<p>Tuesday night I tried again, same thing happened. I asked my friend who's a bit of a tech geek and he said that the stopping nad starting of my xbox during install may have caused a file to corrupt but uninstalling and reinstalling again would take me forever
 on my super slow connection.</p>
<p>Annoyed about Black Flag, I tried playing minecraft, when I get to the title screen and click "play game" it freezes, not even giving me the option of getting to the two blocks where I pick a game. Thinking about what my friend said about Black Flag, I uninstalled
 Minecraft and Reinstalled as it's a much smaller file and only took an hour. Still doing the same thing now it's reinstalled.</p>
<p>After this happened I tried loading Worms Battlegrounds up and that's working fine.</p>
<p>I don;t know whether I have a fault with the games, my account or my xbox and I'm starting to get really annoyed and frustrated.</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>

<p>Hey! Sorry about the issue! Have you tried hard-restarting your console? You just have to hold down the Xbox One power button till it fully switches off. Then try playing a game. Also, If you have other apps/games running in the background turn them off
 by pressing the start button and pressing 'Exit'</p>
<p>Come back to this if this does not work</p>

            <p><span>Hi Allan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform Disk cleanup to free space the disk. However, be informed that the windows 7 backup file will be automatically deleted from your system,&nbsp;from the&nbsp;30&nbsp;days you have upgraded to Windows 10. If you perform Disk cleanup you
 will not able to go back to the previous Operating system version. If you want to go to previous operating version you have to perform clean installation. Visit the below link for Disk cleanup in Windows 10</span></p>

    <title>filenames on flash drive appended with .XML - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            filenames on flash drive appended with .XML</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; I have a flash drive that I have used many times in many computers with no problems.&nbsp; However, this time when I went to use it all of the file names have been appended with .XML.&nbsp; So, for instance a file named ATO2.ppt became ATO2.ppt.XML.&nbsp; If I delete
 the .XML the file tries to open with the correct program, in this case Powerpoint, however, after the Powerpoint initial screen comes up, it says it can't read the file.&nbsp; I have tried opening it on a couple computers and both have the same problem.&nbsp; As I said,
 I have used this flash drive for a while now, so I know the files were stored correctly and are likely there.&nbsp; Would appreciate any advice you may have.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These types of issues are usually caused by a Virus or a Malware. I would like to ask you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you connected the flash drive to another PC after which this could have started?</li><li>Which security software are you using on your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Run a Virus Scan</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would recommend you to run a complete virus scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner. It will scan the computer for viruses and malicious programs. To download it and know more about it, click on the link below.</span></span></p>

<p>Just did that one again. Took a long time but not too difficult. The trick is to open up as much empty slot as you can. At the end the 2 stacks I made was diamonds and hearts.</p>
<p>The REAL challenge in this pack is #5 where you have to make 4 stacks in 75 moves. I suggest to leave this one at the end after you finish the other 79 puzzles!</p>

<p>StativeWharf15, the one I mentioned is actually to score 800 points in 75 moves, which is essentially to make 4 stacks because if you only make 3 stacks you can only get 300 bonus points in additional to the starting 500 points minus 1 point for each move/undo
 action. So in this challenge you need to make 4 stacks in 75 moves while undoing fewer than 13 times! (Since each time you undo you also waste a move.)</p>
