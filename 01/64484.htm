            Hi Terri,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately in this case if you've contacted support and do not have an activation key, it is no way to get it back.
<br />
<br />We are community members and cannot re-create a key or force support to provide a new one.
<br />
<br />Maybe you can find some alternative for this program and use it.       
        </p>

            Terri, you can install Belarc Advisor and run it and it will record all the product keys on your older installation and should reveal the program's product key if it is detected in the registry.<br /><a href="http://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor</a>

    <title>PC settings of Lock screen is crashed on windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ridza asrul  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC settings of Lock screen is crashed on windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>When I open the lock screen setting, via [charm bar]&gt; [change pc settings]&gt; [pc and devices]&gt; [lock screen], it crashed and the pc settings window is closed. Whenever&nbsp;I click the [pc and devices], it automatically select the [lock screen] because it on the
 top, and then windows crashed. So that I can't open the lower menu of pc and devices (display, bluetooth, devices, etc), because it always crashed on lock screen menu. The other settings&nbsp;except [pc and devices]&nbsp;is running fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It happened after I update my tablet (Samsung ativ smart pc, running on windows 8) to windows 8.1 final. I update and install&nbsp;it via windows store. Before the upgrade, all is running well. Is this bug exist because the windows 8.1 update not downloaded completely?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ever try to use amazing lock screen apps to change picture. Yes it can be changed via apps. But the [lock screen] setting still crashed. so i uninstall the apps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope the update to fix the bug is come out soon. Thanks.</p>

            If you go to the desktop Control Panel under System and Security::Action Center::Problem Reports (you can find this via View All Problem Reports), are there crashes listed here associated with when you try to run the PC Settings Lock Screen area?&nbsp; If so
 the report information contained there might be helpful / illuminative to share.

            Hei thanks, I've tried you trick, and pc setting running well in the new account (just like what you say) . But still, It won't solve the main problem in primary account. Microsoft should concern about this bug.

            <p>I'm on the team of people who would be interested in this.&nbsp; It's really difficult to guess at this kind of thing over the internet versus looking at it in person.&nbsp; I pinged a friend who is more probably aware of any issues in this area, but he's on vacation
 currently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's working correctly on a new account given about where the crash probably is given the crash data I'm curious if your lock screen image cache is somehow corrupt.&nbsp; If you forced me to guess, I would suspect that something was wrong with the folders
 under C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData , but that's nothing but a wild theory based upon close to zero information.&nbsp; I'll see if my friend has anything to say, but he won't be back for a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks to be a side effect of profile corruption (disk error?).&nbsp; If I can get a repro locally I'll see if there's anything we can about this for the future.</p>

            <p>Yeah, It finally solved. Thank you very much, zachd!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I open C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData and found some lock_screen files in it. at first, i got some problem to delete them, because of security permission.&nbsp;I&nbsp;add&nbsp;permission to my account (full control) and those files can be deleted. Now, after
 those files are gone, the lock screen setting can be used normally.</p>

<h2>            Moving Win32 apps to Micro SD card</h2>
                    <p>Just purchased a Dell Inspiron 11 3162 which only comes with 30GB eMMC and I'm wondering whether Win32 apps (e.g. iTunes, Google Chrome ect) can be installed to&nbsp;a Micro SD card as I've ran out of space on my hard drive?
</p>
<p>Can you change the default install location for Win32 software?</p>

<p>There's not really much of a "default location" for Win32 software. Every program gets to choose for itself where to install -- and some programs will give you a choice when you are installing them. But that's entirely up to whatever person or company built
 it. &nbsp;Otherwise, you can only really override it with complex symlinks, but that's pretty hacky and can really cause problems if you aren't careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as installing them on the SD Card, you can (if the installer gives you a choice), but honestly it would probably run so unbearably slow that you'd hate it. &nbsp;I'm talking it could take many minutes to open your web browser. &nbsp;iTunes - quite a white longer.</p>

</p><p>I have installed a few Windows Store apps to the SD card, and they run fine. As for the Win32 software, I guess I'll have to uninstall an app to install another one... Maybe I should've bought a laptop with a bigger hard drive lol

 Has this feature been dropped?

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Have not been able to find support for WMP in W10, mp3 codecs plugin. They are push the Groove music app. I started converting the mp3 to wma, so I could use WMP. But that is starting to suck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not find them any more but maybe the W7 codec plugin would work.</p>

<h2>            I lost windows when I formatted my hard drive</h2>
                    I had a lenovo laptop with a full windows 10 home installed. the laptop died and I took out the hard drive with windows 8 to use it for a new custom pc. I booted up normally and it had all the files and stuff from my old lenovo laptop. I wanted to clear
 all of the junk and start fresh so I formatted the hard drive and used the iso file from the media creation tool on an usb drive to install windows 10 through the troubleshoot section. But then it turns out I lost windows through that process and I have this
 activate windows watermark on my screen. How do I get back my windows 8 from my formatted hard drive??? I did this with another laptop with a windows 10 and formatted it and used a media creation tool to install windows 10 again and it worked and I was able
 to use the full windows 10.

<p>I don't really remember the microsoft account used on the lenovo laptop as it had been broken for a long time and I only took the hard drive to use in a custom pc a week ago. The laptop ran using windows 8 not 10. Maybe thats why it didn't activate. I tried
 the stuff in the link you sent but none of it worked. I am using windows 10 home on the pc that doesn't recognize the windows. Help me out please</p>

<h2>            Photo Gallery does not respond</h2>
                    When starting this with Windows 10 It goes straight into a mode of not responding. Sometimes it complains about codec with a particular photo which is just a .jpg file. I've run repair and have uninstalled and re-installed several times. What can I do

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I followed the steps you suggested and got the same result. The were no OLD prefixed files and there was Pictures.pd6 rather than a 4 or 5. I renamed this to OLD_Pictures.pd6. and tried again. It started and then displayed a "Recovering
 from an unexpected exit" message and then closed. I started it again and this time it came up and displayed the window saying Loading but stopped there I had to close it via task manager. I had another look at the user profile and now there is an additional
 file called Pictures.pd6_corrupted.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run system file checker(SFC) </strong>and see if it helps.<br />

</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>

            <div>1 change is that it's actually 'could not be written' not 'could not be read'</div>
I will submit the error message when I next see it
<div>The 'third time' thing is pretty self explanatory. On average I get it about every 3 times when I click my user I get the explorer.exe message.</div>
<div>And no I have no recent hardware changes in my computer since I started getting this error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm actually considering clean booting to Windows 7 and I do not want to restore this computer for the second time. (Not that you knew that) I just don't enjoy starting from scratch unless I'm going to upgrade.</div>

            Well i did the full sfc scan and I still get the issue. I keep forgetting to record it the explorer.exe error and I instinctively start it in task manager.
<div><br />
<div>Clean boot is an option I'm not going for; but if that is the last resort I will clean boot to Windows 7. But I do need some help with some things on my on upgrading in my other forums.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suppose I'm stuck with it until I upgrade. &nbsp;</div>

            Running sfc /scannow will not help you.&nbsp; You do not have symptoms consistent with a need to run the system file checker and that is not what the system file checker does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.<br />
<br />
Suggest sfc /scannow is akin to saying "I have no idea what the probem is or how to fix it".<br />
<br />
When sfc /scannow runs successfully, you will only see a starting and complete message in the Event Viewer System log.
<br />
<br />
It can take a long time to run and slow your system down.&nbsp; When it starts and stops successfully you only will see events like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
There is no information about what it did or what it didn't do.<br />
<br />
<b>Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do</b>, you will not know about it, but you will have wasted your time and still have your original problem.<br />
<br />
It never hurts to begin troubleshooting a system problem with this:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
</a><br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is curious that your system works sometimes and not all the time, but when Explorer is crashing, I suspect non Microsoft third party shell extesnions.&nbsp; This usually happens when right clicking something and I don't recall ever seeing Explorer just fail to
 launch, but here is another idea.<br />
<br />
When your system boots okay, you could use ShellExView to find and locate and disable non Microsoft Explorer shell extensions (you could disable them all to test) and then see how your system behaves.&nbsp; If it works better, you can enable all the non MS extensions
 again and then systematically disable them in little groups or one at a time (rebooting everytime to test) and perhaps you will find the culprit.&nbsp; Disabling shell extensions does not uninstall anything - they are just disabled for the moment.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and XP will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; XP should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" since they are not Microsoft extensions.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; XP explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.&nbsp;
 If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again.&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave.&nbsp; When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can
 enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!<br />

            Explorer.exe never crashes while I'm browsing, only about every 3-5 times I boot up. And it was so long ago I can't exactly remember what I installed before or after I just put up with it.
<div><br />
<div>Possible Culprits From shellexview</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Mcafee Security Scan. Possible but I do get more Application Errors from Mcafee on SHUTDOWN such as mcshield.exe and MsCvHost.exe. I'm not disabling mcafee I get a trojan about once every fortnight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! D=</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Adobe PDF Converter &nbsp;Highly Unlikely</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Java &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Highly Unlikely.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-iTunes &nbsp; &nbsp; I would presume it wouldn't be that either but it started somewhere near where when we installed that. Might look into that</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Glary Utilities (A PC optimizer and Registry Cleaner) was installed after the error began. Unlikely</div>
<div><br />
<div>A part of Windows Sidebar which I installed for my pc (Installed long after error began)</div>
<div><br />
<div>And &nbsp;A Graphics Module which came with the PC was installed way way before error. Highly Unlikely.</div>
<div><br />
<div>HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO TYPE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also I like your quote.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also I was pretty sure sfc scannow wasn't gonna fix it but it was the only given answer and I was bored so I tried it and I heard the disk spinning on and off so there must have been some 'bad' .dll's</div>

            What is your XP Service Pack version and do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed SP (most people don't).<br />
<br />
Don't get Explorer.exe mixed up with Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe).<br />
<br />
Think of explorer.exe as your desktop...&nbsp;&nbsp; if it is not running, all you will see on your screen is your background image/wallpaper.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) is the browser you use to surf the wide wide world of web.<br />
<br />
If you use ShellExView, you don't have to disable all your non Microsoft extensions at once - just start with some and it is unfortunately a trial and error process that may take some time with all the rebooting.&nbsp; Do 5 things at a time if you want to try to
 speed it up.<br />
<br />
Amongst the knowledgeable volunteers here, I think it would be fair to say that most will agree that McAfee can be troublesome, it is a known memory and CPU hog and if you are having mcshield.exe and MsCvHost.exe errors, you
<i>know </i>that is McAfee.<br />
<br />
Maybe you need to uninstall your McAfee and reinstall a fresh copy or if you want your system to reward you with better performance, ditch McAfee all together and replace it with something with a smaller footprint like
<i><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></i>.<br />
<br />
I won't even install McAfee on my system even to test anything - that is how much I can't stand it, but I know some people love it, some are forced to use it and some Internet Service Provides give it to you for free.&nbsp; That doesn't mean it is trouble-free.<br />
<br />
If you choose to uninstall it (at least to test) be sure to use their uninstall instructions that you can read here:<br />
<a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331</a><br />
<br />
You can always reinstall it again if you are compelled to do so, right?&nbsp; You already know it is a troublemaker and causing your shutdown problems.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and run the MBAM and SAS too.&nbsp; No single AV program seems to know about everything, so it is prudent to supplement your stuff with MBAM and SAS (you may be surprised at what your McAfee has missed).<br />
<br />
It doesn't take me long to type in most stuff - I just copy and paste it from my notes.&nbsp; Once I get a good thought, I only have to type it on once.&nbsp; I have looked at lots and lots of explorer.exe crashing problems...<br />

            <p>We have a child account linked to my child's email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have family safety configurations for this account. If my child is kept at this account, everything is safe and good. However:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My child is able to start a new local account when he is in his account. By this local account, he by-passes the family safety and able visit the sites we had blocked for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>His child account is not an administrator account. It is a standard account.</strong></span></p>

            <p>1. I do not have win 10 pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I should not have to "tell my kid" to stop doing something that they want to. If my word would apply, I would not need to set family safety in the first place!</p>
<p>3. Family safety being not foolproof makes it so useless, it is cross-purpose. It should have been meant to be foolproof!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need microsoft to find a way to stop children start new accounts and bypass family safety when they start operating in their child account! In this environment family safety makes absolutely no sense. I f my kid can bypass it, why would I need family safety
 in the first place. How can microsoft even really rationalize this???</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To all of you suffering with Windows 10 Family safety, I have one piece of advice for you:
</p>
<p><strong>DO A CLEAN INSTALL BACK TO WINDOWS 8.1!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Spare yourselves the weeks of **** I went through trying to get it to work properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting aside&nbsp;all the dumb changes they made in Win 10, it simply doesn't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And worst of all, any child can easily bypass the safety settings in 3 seconds flat by simply switching to a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe me, spare yourselves. As big a pain as it is to do a clean install you will be happier. My PC finally works again as it should. If you're still within 30 days of the upgrade you can try to revert back but that didn't work for me, the files were already
 corrupted and anyway the new setup is abysmal </p>

            <p>Sorry to hear your Xbox was stolen you can contact Xbox support and let them know the console was stolen but they will not be able to track down your console. The only thing you can do is contact your local police about the stolen console they will be able to contact Xbox and get more info. You can also login to xbox.com and go to my account and click Xbox Live protection click require profile download. 
 I would also suggest removing your credit card from your Xbox Live account.</p>

<p>On the plus side, you can now remove the Remember Password option remotely from all consoles. &nbsp;Follow the steps at this link</p>

<p>Have the officer call this number: &nbsp;(425) 722-1299</p>
<p>It's also irritating they don't make the IP addresses your devices have logged in from available in a log in your account portal. &nbsp;Why keep that secret? &nbsp;Idiots. &nbsp;Now I have to trust that 5.0 will follow up. &nbsp;Why would they care to follow up if they have
 bigger fish to fry? &nbsp;It might get lost in the paperwork shuffle but if we knew what the IP was we would have more leverage to have them make a house call!!!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App Notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebm22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Notifications</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a strange issues with the notifications for the windows 10 mail app. I have had no problems with the mail app itself however any time I receive an email and I click on the notification from the action centre it sends me to a different inbox
 within the mail app and does not open any emails. I would imagine that the notification for individual emails would open the email that it belongs to not just a short cut to the app. I have 4 different email accounts with 3 of them being used often. Even after
 opening the email notification I cant access the email that it belongs to through the app as for some reason all the different inbox's become jumbled and I cannot access the actual emails. I need to close the mail app and reopen it from the start menu or another
 short cut in which case it works perfectly. It seems like the notification in the action centre is not communicating correctly with the mail app. Was wondering if anyone else had any similar issues or if there is anyway to fix this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Run Windows PowerShell as administrator. Then type this command:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove-AppxPackage microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.6106.42001.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>to uninstall the mail app. After that go to Store to reinstall and it should work fine. Remember to&nbsp;change the notification option of the Mail app once more. Good luck&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I tried this method however the notification issue still occurs. I think its an issue that's caused by having multiple accounts on the mail app as I have tried the app on my surface pro with only one account and the notifications
 work perfectly

            It looks like this issue has been resolved. Must have been a update to the mail app that has fixed this. Anyone else had this problem fixed?&nbsp;

<h2>            Brakes on flight simulator x</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>When I try to brake, the brakes doesn't work, which makes it rather difficult to stay on the runway :(.</p>
<p>I can steer on the ground, and everything else works.</p>
<p>I have checked the cables ect.</p>
<p>Is there a setting that I might have missed?</p>
<p>or is it broken?</p>
<p>I use Windows 7 and the name of the pedals is Pro Pedals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

It is the responsibility of the company to make newer releases more enticing by adding further value through improved features and functionality. Microsoft Office has been one of the company's biggest successes. For more than 20 years, the company has released new revisions with unique features that make it an enticing upgrade. At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.

            hello Definitelynotcade
<br />The last 30 days of your conversation history are stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you’re signed in to Skype on any device.
<br />
<br />History older than 30 days is saved on your hard drive, according to your history settings. 
<br />
<br />You can back up your history if for any reason you need to uninstall Skype, or if you want to transfer your history from one computer to another – for example, from a Windows PC to another Windows PC, or a Windows machine to a Mac. You just need to copy the main database file in your Skype Name folder. 
<br />
<br />To save and transfer your conversation history:
<br />
<br />-Press and hold the Windows key  on your keyboard, then press R to bring up the Run window.
<br />-Type %appdata%\Skype into the Run window and press OK.
<br />-Navigate to the folder named after your Skype Name.
<br />-Right click on the folder itself and select Copy. This will copy the entire folder including all its contents.
<br />-Save the folder to an external media device.
<br />-On your new computer, install and sign in to Skype so that the necessary folder is created, then sign out of Skype again.
<br />-Still on your new computer, go to the Run window again, type %appdata%\Skype and press OK.
<br />-Navigate to the folder named after your Skype Name.
<br />-Replace the entire folder (named after your Skype Name) with the folder that you saved in step 4 and 5.
<br />-Sign in to Skype. Your chat history will be there when you browse through your conversations.
<br />let me know if it helps

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement</h2>
                    <p>Xbox Enforcement, you are still a COMPLETE&nbsp;JOKE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;XBOX/MICROSOFT&nbsp;FRANCHISE. Your decision the uphold my suspension is a mistake, if you knew how to do your job, you would have released me from suspension. Its absolutely&nbsp;ridiculous that there is no way to contact ANYONE from enforcement through anything other than a case review, which I can only imagine how many are taken so lightly. Xbox Enforcement, you have banned me unjustly by what random people unjustly report me for. Its unbearable to think that you don't even take the time to find out what is actually legitimate and what is not, Its crazy knowing you don't think, or care, about doing the right things. To you, any suspension you put on an account will surely only help the xbox live community. Well i think you're wrong, I've never been so upset at the lack of commitment to a better gaming experience Xbox promises. We should be able to speak to someone about our suspensions, especially when we have

<p>Hi, unfortunately the Enforcement team do not use the forums. All it takes is one report, data is grabbed and sent with the report to Enforcement, who then investigate it. If your conduct violated the code of conduct, you will get suspended. No matter what
 the circumstances or who started it, a violation that is reported gets actioned. All enforcement notifications give a summary of the violation eg "engaged inappropriate communications" they will never show you the exact communication so as to not provoke reprisals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry you feel hard done to but we all agreed to abide by the code of conduct.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only option is to contact Enforcement through the enforcement site, Nothing can be done over the forms. Keep in mind bans can happen weeks after the fact, They investigate everything thoroughly. If multiple people have reported you they would be able
 to see that. If its a ban you should get an email stating what it's for. Suspensions you don't since they are temporary.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox Frame lag basically bricks my console</h2>
                    So everytime I turn off my console, I just turned it off with the controller. Now when I do this, or I just turn it off by pressing the button, the Xbox will turn on next time as a super laggy about 2 frames a second xbox. It won't be able to load anything
 and is practically unasable in anyway. The only way this doesn't happen is when I hard reset my console, which will make it work fine when turned on. I haven't found anything on this so I thought I'd come here. I am a preview member and have had another console
 breaking issue with preview program if that is the cause of this. Please let me know what you guys think.&nbsp;

<p>I have found it best to do a hard reset every couple of weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.<span>&nbsp;

            If you experience issues the first time you turn off your Xbox after a hard reset, then this definitely isn't normal. If that is the case, I would either blame the preview program or a hardware issue. You could try to opt-out of the preview program and
 see if it helps your issue.<br />
