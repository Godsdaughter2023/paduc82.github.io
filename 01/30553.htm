<h2>            Looking for Laid back, mature gamers</h2>
                    
<p>Like the title says. I'm just looking for some laid back, mature, down to earth people to play some games with on Live. I'm usually on on weekends or sporadically during the week days due to my work schedule.
</p>
<p>My main game as of now is Black Ops, I'll usually hop on that. Hope to find a group of good players to work as a team and just pub-stomp and have some laughs and good times. I have a 1.82 k/d and a 1.5 w/l and level 50 14th prestige for those who care. Seeing
 as I can only play weekends now, I'll be rusty on my gameplay. I just wish I did have more time to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other games I own:</p>
<p>CoD:MW, CoD:MW2, CoD:BLoPs, Halo Reach, Gears 1 &amp; 2, LA Noire, Portal 2, Medal of Honor, Red Dead Redemption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Games I plan on getting:</p>
<p>AC:Brotherhood (I know I'm lagging on this game), Batman Arkham City, Gears 3, Battlefield 3, CoD:MW 2.5 ( I mean MW 3), Uncharted 3 (My PSN is SugahFree as well)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really want to join a clan as I don't have the time to fully commit to one, plus the first clan I joined here on live really killed it for me. The leader was a complete ****. I did however join a second clan after that but I felt like I was dead
 weight since I wasn't able to be on as much due to my schedule; Also for anyone that may be looking for a group of REALLY good gamers I suggest you look them up - BoMB clan

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for any floaters out there, male or female and are in the same position send me a message on XBL and / or FR. Hope to find people around my age range, I'm 26 from California. I don't think I could handle playing with anyone under 18.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and hope to see you online.</p>

<h2>            Sims 3 cheat, ctrl&#43;shift&#43;c not working</h2>
                    <p>The Sims 3 cheat worked perfectly fine when I first installed the game on Windows 7 about half a year ago, until maybe 2 weeks ago, when out of nowhere I typed out the combination and all I got was my cursor becoming a + for taking pictures in the game.</p>
<p>Absolutely no idea how it happened, and everything I tried did not resolve the issue (obviously or I wouldn't be posting this question).</p>
<p>I've already researched the issue and it's not uncommon, however everything I've found suggests including the Windows key in the combination, but that does diddly squat.</p>
<p>I'm extremely attentive towards computer updates, whether it be for Windows, or Chrome, or anything else, so I don't know how I could've missed something like this if that's indeed the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =]</p>

<h2>            BSOD irql_not_less_or_equal error everytime I open a steam game.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got my computer up and running after not using it for a couple months, cleaned it out of viruses and what not and then upgraded it from windows 7 64 bit to windows 10 64 bit. All of my drivers are up to date, and yet anytime I attempt to open
 a game on steam it crashes and I get a BSOD saying irql_not_less_or_equal. I have tried various other solutions that I found online and none of them seem to work.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security 
<br />products are just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds. The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.
<br />
<br />Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by 
<br />manually checking at the System maker and device makers' sites.
<br />

<br />
<br />====================================================  
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide  Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br /> ====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

                    <p>I bought some cards for my son from a CVS in Jacksonville Florida while on vacation and now that I've returned to my country it's saying it can't activate until I contact the merchant since I can't find the receipt.</p>
<p>Can anyone help on this matter? &nbsp;Or give me a number that I can call. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately since the error says that the card is not activated you will have to bring the card back to the store with the receipt and ask them to activate it for you. Xbox support can not help regarding activating codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you're using a code bought in another region it will not work in other regions. Things like digital games are region locked and currency can only be redeemed if you are in that country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try contacting xbox support but I'm afraid they will tell you that they can't help in this situation:

<h2>            How do I use the money in my Microsoft Account balance&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, my existing points balance was converted to cash. I have just also redeemed a card for 4200 points which was also converted to cash and so now I have a Microsoft Account balance in excess of £49.</p>

<p>I am trying to by the Ghosts Season pass&nbsp;(on PC) but it says I need to add a payment method. If I add a credit card then still that is the only method I can buy the season pass with.</p>

<p>How do I use my Microsoft Account balance to purchase the season pass? Will it work on console?</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You cannot use your Microsoft Account balance on Xbox.com currently. You'll need to make the purchase on your Xbox 360 console.<br />
<br />
If you have enough to purchase the season pass you can go to your console, navigate to the season pass in the game's menu or on the marketplace and purchase the item. If you don't have enough money in your Microsoft Account then you will need to start the transaction
 with your payment method (credit card/debit card) and you'll get a prompt letting you know that you can use your remaining Microsoft Account balance on the transaction.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot install Service Pack 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawsondog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Service Pack 2</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying, and trying and trying for months to install Windows Service pack 2.&nbsp; It gets as far as displaying a mesage of "Installing stage 3 of 3 - 100%.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer." and then after about 5 minutes of displaying this message
 a new message appears stating "Service pack did not install correctly - reverting changes.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer.</p>
<p>I have contacted Microsoft support which I have&nbsp;followed their instructions listed below and tried everything the technician told me to do.&nbsp; I even allowed them remote access to my PC to check settings, delete files, temporarly disable my antivirus software
 with no success.</p>
<p>After all these months of trying to install Service pack 2 on my Vista PC I was told by the technicians "<em>it was my pleasure to work with you on your Windows service request 1145414971.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve your issue.&nbsp; However, I
 hope that you were happy with the service provided to you."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Gee, I wonder how many customers would take their car in to the mechanic to have&nbsp;them try and fix an issue and after months of trying to resolve the issue get a response of "<strong>sorry we cannot resolve your issue.&nbsp; But I hope you were happy with the
 service provided to you!!!"</strong></p>
<p>SERIOUSLY???&nbsp; This is how Microsoft treats their customers???&nbsp; Microsoft puts out a<strong>DEFECTIVE</strong> product (either with Windows Vista or their Service pack 2) and has a customer call (and call) trying to resolve the issue only to be told "Sorry
 we can't help that our product won't work."&nbsp;</p>
<p>No wonder Apple's stock is going through the roof!!!&nbsp; Here a suggestion Microsoft that might help you keep up with Apple . . . try putting out a product that does not cause your customers to want to pick up their PCs and throw it out the window!!!</p>
<p>Here are all the "hoops" Microsoft had me jump through to try and resolve this issue (without any success):</p>
<p><span>During the Windows Vista SP2 installation, one of the most common causes of failure occurs when a third-party application holds open a file or locks a file that the
 Service Pack installation program has to use. For example, a third-party antivirus or antispyware application may cause this problem. If you are running any third-party applications such as Spyblocker, Internet or web accelerators (programs designed to boost
 the speed of the Internet connection), security or antivirus programs (McAfee, Norton, etc.), I recommend temporarily disabling or shutting them down during the troubleshooting process. Please be sure to re-enable them once the process has completed.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After that, I recommend running Reset Windows Update Tool and System Update Readiness Tool.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Step 1: Run Reset Windows Update Tool and System Update Readiness Tool</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>=========================================================</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Please download and run Reset Windows Update Tool "MicrosoftFixit50202" from the link below:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9665683</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Please download and run System Update Readiness Tool from the link below according to the System Type:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista 64-bit</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=f6f353c0-d00e-43e7-97ef-0feefc7ff064</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: It may take an hour or more to detect and replace the incorrect data; please be patient. When it is finished, please restart the computer
 and install Windows Vista SP2 again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If Windows Vista SP2 still cannot be installed, I suggest downloading the Standalone Installer and installing it in Clean Boot Mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2: Download Windows</span></span><span>Vista</span><span>
 SP2 Standalone Installer</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>===========================================</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Download Windows</span></span><span>Vista</span><span>
 SP2 Standalone Installer from the link below according to the System Type:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows</span></span><span>Vista</span><span>
 Service Pack 2 - ALL Language Standalone for Windows Vista 64-bit (KB948465) (745.2 MB)</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8ad69826-03d4-488c-8f26-074800c55bc3&amp;displaylang=en</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 3: Install Windows</span></span><span>Vista</span><span>
 SP2 in Clean Boot Mode</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>========================================</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please disable all startup items and third party services when booting to avoid conflict when installing Windows Vista SP2.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Click "Start", type: MSCONFIG in the search box and press Enter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Please click "Continue" if the "User Account Control" window pops up.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click "Services", check the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box and click "Disable All" (if it is not gray).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Click "Startup", click "Disable All", click "OK" and restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Temporarily disabling the Startup Group only prevents the startup programs from loading at startup. This shouldn't affect the system or
 other programs. We can manually run these programs later. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Please double click the downloaded Standalone Installer and follow the instructions to install Windows Vista SP2.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To restore the computer to use a Normal Startup, repeat step 1 above. Then click "Normal Startup" on the General tab, click "OK", and then restart
 the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the issue persists, please collect a screenshot of the error message, the latest System Information and CheckSUR log for further research.
 Please be sure that the information does not contain any of your confidential and private information. It's for troubleshooting purposes only. Thank you for understanding.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>How to capture a Screenshot (error message)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>==============================</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. When the error appears, please press the Print Screen key (PrtScn) on the keyboard.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click "Start", point to "All Programs", point to "Accessories" and then click "Paint".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. In the Paint program, click the "Edit" menu, click "Paste", click the "File" menu, and click "Save". The "Save As" dialogue box will appear.
 Type a file name in the "File name:" box, for example: screenshot.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Can I upgrade OEM Win10 Home to Retail Win10 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Moving to a new PC that I'm building myself. Currently running Dell OEM Win10 Home. New PC will have Win10 Pro, MSDN (multi-activation or retail keys) version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My backup software can do a "system transfer" that will allow me to transfer everything (OS and applications) to the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I upgrade from OEM Home to MSDN Pro on the old computer and then transfer everything to the new computer?</p>
<p>Or just install Win10 PRO MSDN on the new computer and use the backup software vendor's application transfer program to move the applications and registry entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goals are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not have any "dinosaur bones" either from the OS on my SSD from the old OEM Home version on the new PRO version</li><li>Not have to reinstall and reconfigure everything (which would take about a week)</li></ol>
<p>Thanks for any advice I can get...</p>

<p>Hi BobMac1547x,<br />
<br />
I understand that you want to transfer your files, apps and system configuration from your old PC to your new computer using a backup software. However, this will only work perfectly if both PCs have similar hardwares (motherboard, videocard, soundcard, etc.).
 When creating a system backup, the OS, apps, settings and all device drivers will be included. With that said, if you're going to transfer it to your new PC with a different hardwares, it will cause compatibility issues. Same goes with the system settings.
 Since it's from Dell, there might be some settings&nbsp; and drivers that are not appropriate with your new PC. What I recommend is that you only restore or copy your important files. Still, it is always best to install Windows and apps from scratch. This might
 be a tedious task and will take you a week to accomplish, but will definitely avoid software issues in the future.<br />
<br />
Now, to answer your question, no need to upgrade your old PC to Pro. You can create a system image with a Home version, then change it to Pro once you restore it to your new PC by following the steps in this

<p>You might have activation issues if you were to transfer the Dell OEM image to the new PC. OEM OS are locked to the original manufacturer and are not transferrable.</p>
<p>The best way will be to clean install Windows 10 Pro to the new hardware, do not use it on the old Dell. This will give the best performance and won't transfer any old Dell software or settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to install all your programs and apps to the new PC and although it may take you longer will be better in the long run. Make sure you can extract your personal files individually from the Dell image.</p>

<h2>            Two finger Scroll dell windows 10 and mouse pointer freeze after ocasional click problems</h2>
                    My new windows 10 dell laptop used to be able to two finger scroll on touchpad, I deleted some files to make room for memory, now the two finger scroll doesn't work and the mouse pointer itself freezes from time to time after I click on something occasionally.
 What do I do to fix these two problems? Please and thanks

<h2>            Ended windows Explorer and shut down pc</h2>
                    I know there are other questions like this, but none of these have worked for me or fixed my computer. I assume those people still had their computer turned on after they ended windows explorer, but I turned mine off and know when I restart it, it won't
 load the login screen it will just be a black screen with the mouse cursor on it. I even tried going in to safe mode by pressing F8, but nothing happens, and I tried refreshing the computer by using the repair disk, but refreshing it comes out with an error,
 which says "the drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.". I also attempted suing checks but it said there were no problems. And I initially started up the pic it came out with an error"unmountable_boot_volume",I think it
 has to do with me ending windows explorer. Anyways, I really need some answers fast, thank you for helping.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F8 option to go to the safe mode does not work in Windows 10 to go to the safe mode or perform repair operations on the system Windows Recovery Environment&nbsp;has been introduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore to go to the safe mode, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p><span><span>a.&nbsp;Click on Windows key, and in the Power Options click on Restart while pressing the shift key.<br />
b.&nbsp;A blue screen will appear with a few options.<br />
Click on Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.<br />
c.&nbsp;Your system will automatically restart, press 4 or F4 key to go to the Safe Mode.<br />
If you do not face the same issue in the safe mode, try doing a clean boot</span></span></p>

<h2>            Where is &#39;run with graphics processor&#39; context menu in Start menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 and was used to the possibility of choosing which graphics processor I use to launch programs from the Start menu. This option does not appear with the latest NVidia drivers, all I get are five options, two of which are about
 pinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now the only workaround is to Open file location and have the context menu option to run with either graphics card/chip from the File Explorer, which is&nbsp;somewhat annoying. I know NVidia Control Panel allows me to set the default graphics processor,
 which is an even bigger annoyance when testing how well an application runs on the Intel chip and comparing it to the Nvidia card.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>S.M.A.R.T.</em></strong><em> (<strong>Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology</strong>; often written as

 on various indicators of drive reliability, with the intent of enabling the anticipation of hardware failures.</em></p>
<p><em>When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so stored data can be copied to another storage device, preventing data loss, and the failing drive can be replaced.</em></p>

<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I just want to know if it's possible to keep me informed about the breakdown origin? Because my xbox 360 had a red light... Why?</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer because I am in relation with EA France. It was crashed during Battlefield 4! My console was started and restarted several times per day!!! Creating short circuits!</p>
<p>So can you explain me the repair made?</p>

<p>Thanks you very much.</p>

            I used the tool to create a bootable flash drive with the 32 and 64 bit versions of the OS, and then chose the 32 bit option, but after the loading files screen finishes it sends me back to the black startup screen with the blue windows logo&nbsp;and no loading
 indicator appears underneath of the windows icon. Am I misunderstanding or doing something incorrectly? I followed the steps in the tool to create the flash drive and then went into the bios of the computer and set it to boot from the flash drive. I never
 found a repair option&nbsp;in the&nbsp;menu after I booted to the flash drive&nbsp;and I appear to be stuck in the same spot as before. Thanks for the help.

Many MP3-players have a small slider switch on the side to protect it from accidental erasure. Moving the switch should fix your problem.<br />

<p>Try swapping the keyboard with one from another computer and see if the problem goes away and/or moves to the other computer.&nbsp; This will help determine if the problem is the keyboard or the computer.&nbsp; If the problem goes away with another keyboard and occurs
 on the other computer with this keyboard, then the keyboard is defective and needs to be replaced.&nbsp; If the new keyboard also has the same problem, then it is most likely something with the computer and not the keyboard.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>do so for at least the keyboard</strong> and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor
 or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>Hey, I need help with my internet connection.</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to fix it. I have my Network Adapter hooked up to the mother-board. It's not wireless.</p>
<p>As you can figure that out for yourself. My Router is a Netgear. It has a mind of it's own.</p>
<p>I want to know How to connect to a "hidden" Network as that's what windows says it is. But it's not. Is it windows' fault?</p>
<p>Or is it the routers'? WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES] is what security I'm using. But I don't know if that's the correct one I should</p>
<p>be using. Is it.</p>
<p>Any answers?</p>

<p>Hi</p>

            If Windows 7 tells you that this file is harmful then you can safely assume it is. It was probably corrupted during the compression process. Try to obtain an intact copy. If you believe that the file is absolutely safe, open it on a disposable WinXP machine.
 It needs to be disposable because it might no longer run after you have opened this file.

            You can't transfer the music via the USB Sound Box.
<div><br />
<div>You'll need to plug your mini disk player into your PC then use copy/paste in Windows Explorer..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or go to the Tascam website and see if they have any software which will help you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should aslo RTM.</div>

<p>When you go to sign into your account on your console and it asks for the new password and you put in the new password is it saying the password is incorrect? or what is it saying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you changed the password for your MS account that is attached to that xbox profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can double check by trying to sign into your account at account.xbox.com and it should bring up the xbox profile with the same gamertag as which is on your xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not that means your signing into a different profile.</p>

    <title>MKV and MTS files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epcot  say:</h3>
<h2>            MKV and MTS files</h2>
                    
<p>In this age of streaming from the net and from the computer it is unthinkable that xbox would not include MKV and MTS codecs into their 360. &nbsp;The MKV codec is used extensively on the internet for hd programing and MTS is the format shot by HD video cameras.
 &nbsp;The PS3 supports MTS. It is a shame to come so close and miss the mark. This is an easy fix add the codecs to the coming fall update.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I wish the 360 played MKV, I don't understand why 360 or Ps3 have yet to include this codec.</p>

<p>Just to clear it up really quick .MKV is a media container format and the video and audio inside could be encoded in almost any format. Anything from MPEG2 video to 10Bit h264x for video and MP3 to DTS-HD for the audio. Also the format isn't widely used
 by legitimate content sources and Windows 7&amp;8 don't have native support for the format. If you really want you can always remux the files into a different container or completely re-encode the file into a format supported by the 360.</p>

<p>You can play MKV files if you have:</p>
<p>1) Windows 7</p>
<p>2) Shark007's Codec Pack</p>
<p>3) If you use the Windows Media Center Extender.</p>
<p>I play MKVs on my 360 all the time.</p>

<p>The thing about this is that it's a deliberate slight by microsoft, they talk about the 360 being the entertainment centre of the living room and yet I have to turn in off and turn on my sumvision live player. Not playing mkv's just causes slight amounts
 of hassle and doesn't stop anyone from engaging in piracy. I would have thought that microsoft would be more interested in selling on the information about what people are watching illegally. Still it's not quite as stupid as only supporting stereo sound for
 mp4 playback. </p>
