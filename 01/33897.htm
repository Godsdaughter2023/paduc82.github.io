    <title>Unable to boot computer after Windows 10 1803 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david brennan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to boot computer after Windows 10 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP ZBook 17 G4 with two Samsung SSDs inside (a 2TB Samsung 960 Pro and the 1TB MZVKW1TOHMLH-000H1 which came with it from HP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the Windows 10 1803 update causes issues. It starts up fine the first time after/while installing the update but thereafter fails too boot on any restart. It says that it is attempting to repair but fails every time. The repair logs to C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt
 which contains a message at the end of the log saying: "Boot critical file c:\efi\microsoft\boot\resources\custom\bootres.dll is corrupt."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to revert to restore points fails. All repair options that I tried failed. The only thing which worked was to revert to previous version which took it back to the 1709 version and lost a whole lot of settings (VPNs, Firefox settings, etc).<br />
</p>
<p>This has now happened twice, losing settings both times - the second time I was telling Windows not to update but in its infinite wisdom it decided to do it anyway while I was away from the computer with the same results - a bricked computer. I have now
 paused updates for 35 days in the hopes that it will be fixed by then.<br />
</p>
<p>The issue seems similar to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/bsod-and-system-crashes-after-the-windows-10-april/c245fde7-3e94-42e7-832a-04b3b052f4e9">
this post</a>, although I didn't get a BSOD (possibly because the HP bootloader software detects and hides it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't have an Acer laptop or an Intel SSD so clearly the issue is much wider than indicated there. Has Microsoft halted the 1803 update yet or publicly acknowledged wide ranging problems?<br />

<p>Similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop PC with Gigabyte UEFI MB / Corsair water cooled, AMD 8-core CPU [not overclocked] / Samsung 500 GB 950 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 1803 upgrade, Win-10 fails to boot at least half the time I try to use PC.&nbsp; I am also experiencing a number of system "freezes."&nbsp; Only using EDGE to surf the net when everything just stops, cursor is frozen where it was last placed, and no hot-keys,
 power-off , "three-fingered salute" nor power-button will work to shut system down.&nbsp; Have to pull the plug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At other times, it also fails to shut-down when power-off by SHUT-DOWN command is used and nothing else is going wrong.&nbsp; Lots of internal I/O occurring [Disk Drive light flashing rapidly], but almost no internet traffic flowing [LAN light on modem not flashing].&nbsp;
 Fails to even shut down by power button when held for more than 4 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often the problem occurs when a cold boot-up [or system freeze re-boot] is attempted, BIOS / POST occurs and then Win-10 attempts to load.&nbsp; Blue, 4-window pane screen appears and the "circular dots" make from 1 to 3 circles.&nbsp; Screen goes blank, then black.&nbsp;
 It is like Win-10 cannot find itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cut power by pulling plug and waiting a while, it will usually power back up and load windows successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Norton Internet Security.</p>

<p>I guess a very late reply is better than none at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried again - I froze Windows Updates for 35 days which must be about up. You must understand, every time I try installing the 1803 update and it fails wastes a significant amount of my time, both from applying and restoring the update and then
 reapplying all the settings which seem to get lost after restoring back to 1709.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I will try again at some point and see if the bootrec commands help. Presumably to boot from the installer I'll need to put it onto a USB key first?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marc Cai, do you have any reason to believe that this will work? It seems like generic troubleshooting. Is there a history of these bootrec commands being able to fix bootres.dll issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the c:\efi directory referred to by the error does NOT exist on my computer currently (even with hidden and system files showing) so it is definitely something that the 1803 update tries to put there and stuffs up.</p>

<p>David, thank you for the quick update. That made me realize that I missed a few things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To clarify a bit about the bootrec method, this should not directly repair the library file (<em>bootres.dll</em>). However, there are links&nbsp;connected to the said .<em>dll</em> file with the bootrec files (<em>BCD, MBR, and others</em>) that could have been
 possibly broken after performing heavy system tasks, including the system update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also missed that the boot error only happened after having the 1803 feature upgrade, and upon going back to the previous version, it did no longer occur.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping the system updated means keeping your system protected. Therefore, we recommend you to review this article be fore you try to install 1803 again:

<p>I have this exact same issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;When it first updated the only way to resolve the issue was to revert to the previous os.&nbsp; Last night windows forced the update on me again but this time reverting to the previous issue doesn't do anything.&nbsp; Why does Microsoft
 force these updates down our throats again if it fails the first time?&nbsp; I'm currently at a loss as to how to get my computer working</p>

<p>I was able to get this to boot successfully but I'm not sure which step was the winner.&nbsp; I believe that this involves an older version or non-existant instance of the bootres.dll being loaded based on the memory.dmp file I found in the c:\windows folder.&nbsp;
 It references a C:\Windows\boot\Resources\custom\bootres.dll which didn't exist.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a C:\boot\Resources folder also without a custom folder and interestingly enough an older bootres.dll (2017 - previous Windows 10 major update?).&nbsp; So I updated the C:\boot bootres.dll (2018 version from the c:\Windows\boot\Resources folder) and
 created a 'custom' folder and copied the bootres.dll and en-US folders into the new custom folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the C:\Windows\boot\Resources folder and created a folder named custom and copied the bootres.dll and en-US folders into that new folder as well.&nbsp; Note I had to take ownership of the Resources folder and change the admin privileges to full
 control in order to make the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this was done in safe mode and I did a few other things as well, disabled all non-microsoft services and ran chkdsk/f on all my drives.&nbsp; I think that was all, oh and after the system booted successfully and I re-enabled all the services, avast pro
 wasn't coming back online so I did a repair on that and now it is working as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>New Users Missing Skype for Business Licence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmansfield2  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Users Missing Skype for Business Licence</h2>
                    <p>For the last month or 2 any new users created can not use Skype for Business they get the error;</p>
<p>"Can't sign in to skype for business,&nbsp; your account appears to be missing its skype for business licence"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an upgrade that happened and we believe this problem may have occurred since that upgrade.&nbsp; We had to update the Azure AD Connect software on the local PC as the Office365 control panel kept saying it was out of date and it would stop working every
 week until a reboot.&nbsp; So that was upgraded but no changes were made to the configuration the installing consultant did.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First I checked the most simple thing.</strong></p>
<p>On the Office365 control panel the users have an assigned licence, same as all old users and the skype for business is ticked. I have tried removing the licence and re-assign it, but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Second I checked the forums</strong></p>
<p>I found lots of older posts with similar problems. Most said either assign the licence, or the account is missing its SIP address.</p>
<p>So i have manually added to the exchange properties an email address of type SIP. This is synced with Office365 as i can see it if i check their profiles online.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">One microsoft support page said the attribute needed to work was&nbsp;<span>msRTCSIP-PrimaryUserAddress , but other posts say you can simply add the SIP address to the list of mail addresses
 (as our old accounts have) </span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>We have never had this property on our system and it is not listed as i believe it needs to be added to the server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Our setup:</strong><br />
Office365 Business Premium licences.</p>
<p>We create the users in our on premises AD</p>
<p>They are synced via a 2nd server that was setup for us by the original consultant a few years ago that runs exchange for the purpose of the Office365(azure)&lt;-&gt;Local AD sync, this exists only so we can have same password on PC as email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for informing us that all the effected users can login to Skype for Business now and we are very glad to hear it. For this issue, we think the lost Skype for Business Online related DNS records
 and the Outlook Autodiscover record are the cause. Without those DNS records, the Office 365 online doesn't know and find those users in that domain, so that error message is prompted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we welcome you post back in a new thread if you are running other Office 365 related issues in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

            I'm not sure I understand, if it is a folder needed by Windows why are you trying to rename?&nbsp; This could and probably will cause you serious issues.

<p>Ummm, you said the computer named the folder but you still did not say the name of the folder.&nbsp; This is important.&nbsp; Because if it is one used by Windows then the answer is no.</p>
<p>Now, if you believe you have a virus, exactly what software did you use to try to find it?&nbsp; What is the exact error message you get?&nbsp; And when do you get it?&nbsp; Afterall, you are assuming you have a bd file but it could be something else.&nbsp; So let's start with
 answering the questions I've asked and go from there...</p>

    <title>ASUS webcam and mic not working, unsure if related directly to 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haileyaleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS webcam and mic not working, unsure if related directly to 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>I know my system upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 sometime in the last week. In that same time frame, my webcam has not been detected by the system. I tried numerous restarts, shutting down and starting up the computer, all to no avail. I tried uninstalling
 the webcam from Device Manager and restarting the computer, but that didn't work. After refreshing the PC, the driver was reintroduced, but the first problem still remains--all relevant programs present some version of "no webcam detected." Today after trying
 to use the Echo Test Service in Skype, I found out that the mic was not working properly either. I'm at a loss, honestly. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling RealTek software and that didn't work. Speakers continue to function perfectly, so there's that
 at least. But even after installing optional updates and restarting my computer, still no progress. I'm honestly at my wit's end. I've searched the internet far and wide for a solution to this problem but nothing has worked. A call with ASUS tech support only
 yielded the result of the webcam drivers now being reintroduced to the PC; otherwise, no progress came of it. I'm thinking at this point my only option may be to either reboot the system totally or take it in to Best Buy and exchange it as a defective product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model is the N550JK. OS is Windows 8.1 64-bit. This computer was purchased not two months ago. I have been reluctant to reboot the system or anything along those lines as I do not have a location to use for system backup. This wouldn't be a terrible
 obstacle, however, as I copied important files into Google Drive, and I would be willing to utilize the reboot option if I were confident it would yield results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

The issue seems to be with the drivers. I would suggest you to run the following fixit and see if that helps.<br />

<br />
</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also re-install the drivers for Asus webcam from the following link:<br />

            <p>Firstly, thank you for responding so quickly! This whole process has been nothing but frustrating and it's nice to feel accommodated this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran the Fix It program, it claimed to have found and successfully resolved issues, yet my webcam and mic are still not functioning. Do I need to restart the computer for the solutions to take effect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link for the drivers is something I've explored countless times over the past few days, and once with the assistance of ASUS tech support, but installing the driver for ASUS Splendid Video Technology, which the support representative recommended to help
 with the webcam issue, yielded no result. Apart from that, the most fundamental problem I'm facing in this regard is not knowing which drivers to install for each respective problem. I tried installing the RealTek driver under "AUDIO" to hopefully resolve
 the mic issue, but after trying this numerous times yesterday and tonight, nothing has happened one way or another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I've also reset my system to factory settings, and it did not resolve either the webcam or mic issues. Since that failed, should I just send in the unit for repair/replacement?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is far too much aggravation (see: any aggravation of this nature whatsoever) to be experiencing with a laptop purchased for $1,000 and not in even moderate use for even five weeks, with no damage of any kind to the unit. I sought help here as something
 of a last resort, and the only person who deigned to reply has not followed up. Absolutely ridiculous. I'm a reasonable person but this issue and lack of response is beyond reason.</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be an issue with the drivers since you are unable to complete the update. We suggest that you perform the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot.
</a></strong>It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and start up programs. It also helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.

<strong>Step 2:</strong> If that doesn't help, try performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore,</a></strong> and see if it helps. System Restore is
 a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. Please take note that when you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state,
 programs and updates that you installed after the restore point has been created will be removed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made NO changes to the computer's configuration prior to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a pre-installed copy of windows (It came with the laptop when my company ordered it - I did not place the order. It was purchased before I started working here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue started about a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried 3 or 4 more attempts to reset the PC to no avail. And now Windows will not launch. I get an error that it is trying to do an automatic&nbsp;repair, but it fails, does a quick "Diagnosing PC", and loops me back to troubleshooting options. I then try
 the reset again, it fails and errors out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an end all command I can try like the old C:\format or something. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to "troubleshoot" anymore - I JUST want a clean boot of the Windows 10 OS. If I had a CD I could re-load the OS with,&nbsp;I would have never even needed to post this issue. How do I re-load a digital Windows 10 OS from scratch - without having
 to reset, or diagnose, or troubleshoot or go back and forth trying this and that. I need the end all reset solution please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Failed Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher mcilveen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>OK - so after being continually pestered and told that my laptop is compatible with Windows 10, and that I can have a free upgrade, but only for a limited time, I decided to go for it, even though my laptop is quite happily running Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what, after having downloaded and applied the upgrade, which took nearly 7 hours, the laptop now freezes when attempting to restart. Having eventually managed to get it to reboot, I get "attempting to recover installation", which fails, followed by
 "restoring your previous version of Windows", which finally gets me back up and running on Windows 7 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update informs me that the Windows 10 upgrade failed, with an "unknown error", gives me error code "C1900101-40017", which seems to be a catch-all for lots of potential issues with upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the time nor the inclination to spend hours trying to work out why this upgrade failed. I was told by Microsoft that my laptop was compatible, which it clearly isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very unimpressed with this whole experience, which from looking around the support community, seems to be a very common view.</p>

            <p>The upgrade to Win 10, build 10240,&nbsp;from Win 8.1 worked very well for me on this Dell Inspiron 3542. A subsequent upgrade to build 10586 also worked well. I'm very happy with it. But you are right to fear it at this point considering your experience &amp; what
 others have suffered - far worse than what you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better get an external hard drive &amp; make a full system backup before trying again. I did that &amp; have been lucky never to have had to restore it.</p>

            <p>Thank You for posting your question Im sorry for the late reply. To understand your technical inquiry more please follow this step to try and determen the problem.</p>
<p>The main problem why the error message keeps coming up due to Windows not being updated, quote the reason for the program saying that there is a file missing, to try and troubleshoot this please try this and follow the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the second link will open a&nbsp;webpage should open up your windows update tool, please make sure that you have selected to receive updates from Microsoft office and Microsoft programs, as there maybe an update for your program/Windows based Machine. Also a

I've been using windows since windows vista and it's my favorite OS , so I'm blown away when i found out i can't update my windows 10 ( currently using 1806 ) to the newest version .&nbsp;<br />
I did a little research and found out it's because some USB or external device are connected yet nothing is connected to my laptop&nbsp;<br />
Drivers are up to date as well .<br />
I was hoping someone could help me here with this problem because i really want that update and it's features .<br />

            Hi Eddon
<br />
<br />What method are you using to update Windows, is that just the usual method from the settings App?
<br />
<br />If so, try this method (it is only an upgrade, not a clean install):
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>Notification During Avast&#33; Boot-Time Scan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamlee-vanwijk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notification During Avast&#33; Boot-Time Scan&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and good day! I will try to be as direct as possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I use Avast! Free Antivirus 2015 for my computer antivirus. Avast! has an option called boot-time scan, which allows you to scan before malware or viruses have the chance to activate. So, I ran a boot-time scan, and while the scan found no virus, it
 did give me about 5 notifications in a row which I quickly, and sloppily, wrote down. So, it might not be exact, but it said something similar to what's below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>FileC:\windows\softwaredistribution\download\<em>they each had a different number in this section</em>\BIT22C2.tmpl&gt;.\.\.\NDP40-KBZ972215.msp Error 42127 (CAB archive is corrupted.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is virus-related,<em> but what is it</em>? About two weeks ago or so, I powered off my computer while it was downloading updates. I clicked "Shut Down", and it started downloading updates.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm wondering if the notifications had something to do with this?&nbsp;</span><em>Even though I know you're not supposed to shut it down during the process (as the screen instructs you not to), I had little choice because
 a thunderstorm was approaching, and I usually turn off my computer and unplug it during thunderstorms.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what is this,&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and </span>
</em></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>are there any steps I should take to resolve this</strong></em></span>? The computer is functioning just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a great day. :)</p>
<p />

            <p><span><span>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk. Remove everything that claims to be there to
 prevent infections or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending
 on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span><a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I look after about 150 Windows PCs and have for over 13 years.&nbsp; Up until last September, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as
 any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security.<span>&nbsp; </span>My clients have rarely ever experienced infections.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Last September Symantec (owner of Norton) decided to no longer sell such a product.&nbsp; After a lot of research, I decided on Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp; I have installed it on&nbsp;most of&nbsp;those PCs so far and there
 has never been a problem, and this has been over a course of about 12 months now..&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is also not expensive. One of the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its "Wallet"
 function.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My clients know well that if they install any "Internet Security" product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned very well the hard way that the other components in these IS products
 (other than the AV itself) cause more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS
 on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; I think the IS product is actually hiding the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical consumer
 Windows consumers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note well.&nbsp; You should never have more than one protection software installed.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That includes software that may have come pre-installed on your computer when new</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a "removal tool" that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it,
 it will cause very hard to understand and diagnose problems.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 or hardware&#58; can&#39;t refresh, can&#39;t reset, lots of error. Brand new Alienware M17xR4</h2>
                    Hey all community people!<br />
<br />
Just received -one week ago- my new computer. A rather nice beast: Alienware M17xR4, designed for gaming. GTX 660M, from Nvidia, 16GB memory. The first days were great, had lot of fun playing games in full graphics or so, amazingly nice.<br />
And Windows 8.<br />
<br />
But then, all this went down. I obviously started customize my computer, and installed several games i had been playing before, such as Starcraft 2 or Team fortress 2. then added mumble, and updated all the drivers. Guess that's what one would do. At that point,
 i already had just a few BSOD W8 style, but nothing absolutely terrible. "This happens, i'm used to it" i've said to myself. Then i updated my GPU's driver -as an update just had been released. I go for it, and see terrible performance drop. I decide to revert.
 I rollback to previous driver, make unsintalls and stuff.<br />
From there, it became extremly buggy: loop boot, intempestive reboots, and finally a really never ending boot loop (previous fixed themselves).<br />
<br />
After hours spent in safe mode, i decide to try a refresh:<br />
-Refresh doesn't work: "there was a problem with your PC, no changes were made". <br />
Fine. After searching more and more, it might be some stuff i installed. Lets restore.<br />
-Restore 1. Boot. Loop boot with an error "UNEXPECTED_MODE_KERNEL_TRAP". After investigating, might be a software. Checked minidump files and stuff, might be driver. thus, let's restore one more time.<br />
-Restore 2, even further back in time: can boot, computer is a bit slow. <br />
<br />
Since i'm fully booted, i'll attempt a refresh, with the custom refresh i had done right after booting the computer for the first time.<br />
-There was a problem........". Alright....I'm slightly getting mad. I'm just going to reset, after having noted down my windows 8 product key.<br />
Reset: "There was a problem with resetting your PC".<br />
<br />
"Wow, this is getting really crappy". Then i'll run a battery of hardware checks from Dell website. Nothing found, everything is totally functionnal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To resume all this:<br />
-Computer can't refresh<br />
-Computer can't reset<br />
-Can't use my custom recovery (refresh image)<br />
-Can't repair<br />
<br />
What did i do<br />
-Ran chkdsk, found errors, fixed. No improvement<br />
-Ran malwarebytes &amp; avira AV, no stuff found.<br />
-Ran Glary's utilities, fixed some errors, no improvement<br />
<br />
<br />
I still don't know if it's hardware or software so far. But Dell's checks tell me it's not hardware actually. But browsing day-long on google and W8 users forums didn't help me.<br />
I'm sure i'm forgetting a lot of symptoms and stuff i did. But hey, that's alread a lot for a one week old high-end computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you'll provide.<br />

            <p>More likely it is a problem with the graphics card, either badly seated or defective.&nbsp; Seeing that this is a new machine, the driver should not be the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Graphics Display driver for the installed graphics card stops responding. When this happens, windows will stop and restart the driver to fix the problem which probably it can't.&nbsp; And that is why you are having these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest you speak with the vender for return and replacement.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried accessing the feature at boot to RECOVER or RESTORE your machine to the state it was in when purchased, or using the RECOVERY DISKS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the games you installed may be causing a problem...one of the drivers you updated, etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update for the Graphics may have triggered the problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have already done so many restores, resets, etc., just restore it to it's AS NEW condition and get a fresh start, and then go from there...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have two Graphics chips, do you also have an app to control them for games and stuff?</p>
<p>How do you select which one is being used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My machine has a program that allows choosing which chip will be used for what..games for instance.</p>
<p>Installing the drivers may have messed something up...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My program needs to be uninstalled before the Graphics drivers are updated, and then reinstalled</p>

            <p>Important detail: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you said you ran Glary Utilities to find and correct errors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registry cleaners do most of the damage in ways you can't even imagine. I&nbsp;used to use them and I know they are only trouble - unless you are an expert reviewing one by one the registry entries that are about to be deleted and confirming. I recommend that
 you don't use any of this products to maintain your PC, especially Windows 8 which performs pretty good&nbsp;maintenance tasks on idle. Maybe, just install CCleaner to erase temporary files once in a while.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To your problem... If I were you I would perform a clean installation (format). Do you have a Windows 8 DVD? If not, go to this page

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes (after installing Windows):</p>
<p>1) Create two disk partitions, one for the OS and one for your files. The second one should be larger. See here for instructions
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2674-partition-volume-create-new.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2674-partition-volume-create-new.html</a>. Make Windows automatically save your files to the second partition. To do so, open the second partition you created and create a folder with your name. Then type %userprofile% in
 the location bar and you'll be transferred to your home folder. Select all containing folders (Picture, Music, Documents, etc.) (Ctrl+A), then cut them (Ctrl+X) and paste them (Ctrl+V) in the folder you created in the second partition. This way every personal
 file will be saved on your second drive and you could easily format and reinstall Windows in the future without the need of backing up your files. Plus, your files will get fragmented less often.</p>
<p>2) Run Windows Update as many times as it needs.</p>
<p>3) Install only missing drivers from Dell's website. See the Device Manager in Control Panel for devices marked with a exclamation mark. Do not install extra drivers if you do not notice functionality problems.</p>
<p>4) Be careful when installing programs so you don't accidentally install adware. Check one by one the installation option so you don't get the&nbsp;extra software installed.
</p>
<p>5) Defragment the partition that contains your OS. Computer &gt; C:\ drive &gt; right click Properties &gt; Tools tab &gt; Optimize.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            flustrated1, are you using Windows Media Player to burn a CD, and if so, what's your WMP version? Where exactly did you select&nbsp;<strong>Burn CD without gaps</strong> ? As far as I know, only WMP 12 supports gapless CD burning.

            I found this to try. (From meghmala)<br />
<br />
<span><span><strong><span>To Rebuild icon cache follow the below mentioned steps -</span></strong><br />
<br />
1. Open Folder Options to select (dot) Show hidden files and folders.<br />
<br />
2. Open a Windows Explorer window.<br />
<br />
3. Go to C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local <br />
4. Right click on IconCache.db and click on Delete.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Click on Yes to confirm the deletion. <br />
<strong>NOTE: </strong>This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.<br />
<br />
6. Close the window.<br />
<br />
7. Empty the Recycle Bin.<br />
<br />
8. Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
9. When you go back, you will notice the Size of the IconCache.db file is smaller, and the Date Modified is now the current date. (See screenshot below)<br />
<strong>NOTE: </strong>If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much, then just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.<br />
<br />
10. The icon cache has been rebuilt.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<h2>            Phantom Skype Calls</h2>
                    <p>I am very confused and freaked out as to what just happened. Basically. I was here skyping with my girlfriend on my phone, and out of no where, my computer comes out of sleep mode because it was receiving a Skype call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres the freaky part, I denied the call, and when I go to see who it is, it prompts me to install Skype for Windows 10. I never had Skype installed on this computer. There wasn't an account logged on to Skype on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a full virus scan with Windows defender and Malwarebytes. Nothing. Came up clean. No weird processes, applications, or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The call came from someone named Richard T.... Can't remember the last name. Started with a T though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered a weird bug like this ever. Specifically with Windows 10. Im freaked out.</p>

 prompted to update it. &nbsp;If you install Skype for Windows Desktop it will also suggest you update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, not a bug or a phantom. &nbsp;More than likely this is what occurred:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have Windows 10 with Skype installed. &nbsp;When you logged into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account it auto-logged you into many of your Windows Apps including Skype. &nbsp;This means by simply signing into your computer, you were signed into Skype. &nbsp;Assuming
 you have a lower power device, someone called you and that woke up your computer. &nbsp;Whatever version of Skype you launched to view the call, prompted you to update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Skype for Windows Desktop is running the process is called Skype.exe. &nbsp;When the Skype App is running the process is called SkypeApp.exe. &nbsp;When the Skype App is or is not on screen an additional background process called SkypeHost.exe remains to receive
 calls and IMs. &nbsp;If you do not want the Skype App to receive calls and IMs you can either set the status to "Do not disturb" or log out of the App. &nbsp;If you do not want ANY Windows Apps to auto log you into their services when you sign in, simply change your
 Windows 10 to sign in using a local account instead of your Microsoft account. &nbsp;That is how I have all my Windows 10 machines configured. &nbsp;If you do not want the SkypApp at all, simply right click on the Skype icon and select "uninstall". &nbsp;This is different
 from Skype for Windows Desktop that needs to be uninstalled from "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel. &nbsp;Be aware that every major update of Windows 10 will reinstall the Skype App as it is included with the OS.</p>

<p>A lot of that makes sense to me. The one thing that still sort of remains unanswered for me is after I installed (Or updated, what ever it did) Skype for Windows 10, and after I logged on with the account it logged me in with by default, there was no history
 in my recent calls of this call taking place, as well as there being zero people in my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it was just a one off bug. A stray call that got routed to the wrong Skype.</p>
<p>I'm not sure though. Clarification on that would be awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as far as the low powered device goes, I am running an i5 6600k, so I wouldn't really consider that "low powered", but perhaps its just the kind of sleep mode I have my computer set into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no migration process from Skype for Windows Desktop to the Skype for Windows 10 App. &nbsp;The App can only retrieve the 30-day cloud history. &nbsp;Whether the prompt exists in the Desktop client or not, the App would have already been present on your machine.
 If you were auto logged in it would be with the Microsoft account you signed into Windows with. You may have been signed into a different account than the one you normally use and that is where the log may reside. &nbsp;The two clients when receiving calls look
 totally different. You should be able to determine which client created the pop-up. &nbsp;I can only go off what you say or saw as I was not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, 6th generation or Skylake CPUs have internal support for modern standby. &nbsp;You have a Skylake CPU.<br />

<h2>            Problems Mapping Network Drives While Connected to Active Directory - Surface Pro</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I configured my surface pro for AD yesterday and have been quite impressed thus far. DNS is working great, RDP to any machine by name and exchange is working flawlessly on office 2013. The one problem I'm running into is mapping network drives. Perhaps
 there's a simple difference on Windows 8 / SP that I'm not aware of but navigating to \\AnyServer\folder is not working. I can resolve these hostnames with no trouble but the same&nbsp;problem&nbsp;exists when attempting to access via IPv4.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Network Error</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows cannot access \\server-blah\blah</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a&nbsp;</div>
<div>problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve&nbsp;</div>
<div>network problems, click Diagnose.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error code: 0x80004005</div>
<div>Unspecified error</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This cannot be a network problem. No&nbsp;restrictions&nbsp;are on any of the machines I'm attempting to connect and L3 is working as intended. Anyone have an idea on what's holding me back?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Adding to this, the problem is not across the board. I'm able to map actual windows boxes, such as:
<div><br />
<div>\\MyLaptop\c$</div>
<div><br />
<div>The main server I'm trying to access is a NetAp - perhaps there is a&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;issue between the two.&nbsp;</div>
