            <p>Hi Cortnee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
As per the query description, it seems like you are unable to hear sound when people call or write on
</p>
<p>Skype.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to gather few information on this issue to help you better:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Which version of Skype are you using? Is it the Modern app for Windows 8 or the desktop version of Skype?<br />
2) Are you having sound issues while using any other application or programs?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be an issue with the audio settings for the playback devices on Skype as this usually occurs when there is an issue with the microphone or speakers connected while using Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Fixit in order to fix sound issues on Skype.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the methods:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to run the Fixit:</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><br />

<p>I would suggest you to refer to the links to check if the audio settings for the microphone or speakers are set properly with Skype for Windows 8:</p>

<h2>            Product Key for Download of Windows 8.1 to USB &#40;Currently Running Win7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple question, but can't seem to find the answer. I downloaded Windows 8.1 to a blank USB to upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[As an aside, I am doing this to utilize the the Windows 8.1 INF file for Legacy 1394 drivers - my Win7 install did not have them for some reason and was unable to install on Win10. The file will not install on my Win7 64-bit OS. And, no, Device Manager
 does not have ANY 1394 drivers listed.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, I am being prompted for a Product Key, of course. How do I get one?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 does not come for free, unless you are upgrading from Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer sells Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Try amazon.com, etc.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Click on the network icon in System tray at right end of task bar, choose Properties on the active network, then choose Private. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            To change from a public network to a private network for vice versa, start by connecting to your network. You can do this by opening the available Network icon in the Notification area. Select the network, then connect to it. After connecting, select it then click Properties.
<br />
<br />Here you can change your Network profile to Public or Private. Choose the one that best suits your environment.
<br />
<br />How to Change a Wired Network to Public or Private
<br />
<br />If you want to change the network profile for a wired network, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Ethernet then click your network adapter.
<br />
<br />Then choose the profile you want.

<h2>            Windows 7 Update postpone button not working</h2>
                    <p>After losing a lot of work some time ago because of an automatic reboot I changed the policy to never reboot automatically with logged on users. Now I get a message where I can click to reboot or postpone for up to 4 hours, I did click 4 hours several times
 now and did click it yesterday for the last time and closed my laptop. This morning the message popped up again and I selected 4 hours and clicked 'postpone'. Immediately after clicking this window came up, giving me 10 minutes without postpone option :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get some more time by changing the system clock, but how do I kill this thing
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">now </span>without reboots? I want this dialog gone and my clock set back to the correct time. And how do I prevent these dialogs in the first place without disabling Windows Update completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have a legit 64-bit Windows 7 Professional installation)</p>

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Rodney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You can follow the steps suggested above to set the computer in such a way that it does not require you to put the password every time you start your computer.</li><li>What is the exact problem are you facing with setting up a guest account?</li><li>Are you getting any problem with enabling the default guest account?<br />
</li></ol>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By default the guest account in Windows 8 is turned off. To turn it on follow the steps below:</div>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Control Panel </strong>by typing Control on a blank part of the Start screen and pressing Enter.</li><li>In Category view click on <strong>Add or remove user accounts</strong>.</li><li>You will see the <strong>Guest account </strong>and the fact that it is turned off, double click on it.</li><li>Click on <strong>'Turn On' </strong>and its activated, close the Control panel and log off or reboot to test your Guest account if you wish.<br />
</li></ol>
<div>The next time you start your machine or logoff you will be given the option to log onto the Guest account or your normal account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also create a new account and assign it the minimum privilege similar to the default guest account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps in the article below to create a new user account.<br />

            Hi Kyne,<br />
<br />
Thanks for responding, I hope you can help?!<br />
<br />
It started about a month ago and this is the first chance i've had to try and rectify it, yes before this time I have preinted from window Live Mail and just cannot understand why I can't now?!<br />
<br />
Well no it just happens when I launch mail itself, I can print from the internet (web pages) but cannot print any of the emails from Windows Live Mail, and Like I say in the job I do I need to print 'go ahead' emails for clients jobs to be printed!?<br />
<br />
I haven't made any changes myself to the computer just the normal windows updates from time to time.<br />
<br />
Hope you can suggest something to fix it.<br />
<br />

<li>What are the exact steps you went through in printing the email? </li><li>Does the issue happen only with this account or the same thing happens with your other email accounts configured in Windows Live Mail?

            I have tried printing direct from the email itself, right clicking on the email and selecting print, going straight to the print button via the Email menu&nbsp;also printing from the toolbar of Mail itself and none have worked, I have resorted to copying and
 pasting into microsoft word and printing the email from there bu then that loses the email info and layout as sent by our clients!<br />
<br />
I only have one email account with mail as its a work one, all emails behave the same and do not print!<br />
<br />
Please help as its not helping with the amount of time I could be working spent copying email text and creating new documents to print from!<br />

<p>ok - i made the change.</p>
<p>i sold FO3 a few months ago just because i had recently bought FNV.&nbsp;FNV was a very good game - and i was lucky enough to experience very few of the widely-mentioned bugs...but i just didn't&nbsp;love it. i had played 160 hours on FO3 on just one playthrough,
 and also got the broken steel DLC.</p>
<p>This week i made the change back - so now my FNV is up for sale on a well known auction site, and i was lucky enough yesterday to receive (from the same auction site) a copy of FO3 GOTY (with all the DLC's included).</p>
<p>so...back to the wasteland to wander aimlessly...and loving it again already!</p>

<p>I played both games from their release dates. In comparison Fallout 3 was more polished the New Vegas. Fewer issues involving glitching and bugs. I notice some glitching migrated to New Vegas ( vendor glitch in particular). &nbsp;I would never sell either game.
 When I get bored, I put the game on the shelf and play something else until the itch comes along to pull the game out. I recently played N.V since the patch and found the game more stable, but also found cosmetically the game had been altered. Still wondering
 if there will be a Fallout 4 with Bethesda's new game engine ??</p>

<p>I've gone back and replayed FO3 too many times to ever sell it. &nbsp;The two games are different enough that one doesn't really replace the other, and I expect that I will treat NV the same as FO3, picking it back up and playing again every few months. &nbsp;I'm
 not enjoying NV as much as I did FO3, but I still like it a lot, and you never know how much each of the coming add-ons will improve the game.</p>

<p>it's funny how, IMO, F03 was more fun, rated higher, with less bugs and much more polished than it's successor FNV. bit of a backwards step that.</p>

<p><span>I loved both games, and consider both to be "keepers."&nbsp; Comparing the two games -- with hindsight -- I give the edge to FO3 simply because I had so much
<b>fun</b> with my house. It was nice to acquire, decorate, stock with extras, heal, repair, rest, get water, store things, see my bobbles, etc. Although I preferred the Megaton location, I thought both locations in FO3 were superior to any place I called home
 in FNV.&nbsp; But, that's just my humble opinion. &nbsp; </span></p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Yup you got that right. I think many people have forgotten or didn't play FO3 when it was released and was really buggy. I haven't had so many problems with FNV as FO3. Of course if you think that, when you can't complete NCR quest's 'cause they hate you,
 is a game ending bug then you might see a lot of bugs in FNV, but actually it's supposed to be that way. Bethesda let's you do every quest no matter if your good or bad, but Obsidian forces you to deal with the consequences meaning you can't do every single
 quest on one playthrough. I love FNV and think it's the real sequel to Fallout 1 and 2 but Fallout 3 is still a great game.</p>

<p>FO3 and FNV aresimilar in many respects, but are also a very different games in some ways. &nbsp;I think that if you love one you'll at least like the other, though most people do seem to have one that they clearly prefer. &nbsp;But both are excellent games worthy
 of spending ridiculous amounts of time on.</p>

<p>I prefer FNV myself simply on the basis you can make things. &nbsp;One thing I'm finding both here &amp; the other forum is that if yuo liked<em> Fallout 3</em> you aren't necessrily a fan of

<h2>            Familysafety screen time issues</h2>
                    <p>Familysafety screen time is broken.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong>First issue:</strong></p>
<p>It is now impossible to set time limits on Android devices (chrome browser), the combo boxes do not work. I do not want to log into a pc every single time I need to set or change the time screen. Is MS aware of the issue and is it being addressed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Second issue:</strong></p>
<p>Often, windows 10 will bug if we switch between time limit on or off. When off and turning it back on, even if time is properly set everywhere needed, my child windows 10 keeps telling his account is locked and he ends ups in a loop to enter password. The
 only fix I have found (after many hours trying new accounts, restarting, etc...) was to reinstall completely windows 10 from scratch. But after a few weeks the problem reappeared. Other than steam and some very official games (I've checked) there is no explanations
 to why this happens. No malware or other of the sort detected. I could find much on the web regarding this issue, but I must not be the only one.<br />

<li>
<p>Are you making those changes as an admin and using the Microsoft Account?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>yes, well I am admin on his computer. &nbsp;Now every changes for familysafety is done online, so I believe as long as I have an admin account on his pc and it is linked with my MS account for familisafety, then yes.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Is the child logging in using the Microsoft Account?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Yes, it's always the same account. After reinstalling windows from scratch he reuse the same account, which worked for some weeks, but now is broken, so I am 100% it is not an account issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Which security software did you run on the pc?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Several, to be honest I don't recall how many I tried. For sure I tried &nbsp;AV (both Avast and Avira), Malwarebyte anti malware, spybots. Except the usual cookie issues, I did not find anything outstanding.</p>
<p>I've tried deleting the account and recreating it, but Windows seems to restore a cached version, so it's not a real delete and replace and that did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the times stoping and starting the PC (not restarting) seems to fix the issue, but last time I had to reinstall all from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am suspecting that some MS update may cause the issue, because, franckly, this is the only thing I do not have control over.</p>

</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several
 programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also encountered your second issue. My son's PC account&nbsp;became disconnected from Family but retained the time restrictions. Consequently he would run out of time but his requests for extra time never reached me and he would just have to wait&nbsp;till
 the next day. I switched off screen time for him but it didn't make a difference to his account on the PC. I also removed him from the family but his PC account still retained the time restrictions. I also spent a couple of hours with 2 different support agents
 on remote desktop who were unable to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to remove his account from the PC and re-add it to get rid of the time restrictions. I've now ditched the whole Family thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you believe that the Microsoft support agent told me that I would have to pay&nbsp;for the fix in order for my son to regain access to his account&nbsp;- appalling! Isn't that what they call ransomware?</p>

            <p>Yes I also faced similar issues before I had to reinstall the whole windows. I agree that asking for money to regain access is pretty much like ransomware... but was the money for the support time spent or to regain access ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much for forcing everyone to move to Win10, familysafety on Windows 7 was a better overall experience for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was a public API for familysafety to play around, I could probably throw a little C# program that I could link to my home server for better local control.</p>

            <p>I take your point about the cost of support time. I guess they were saying that it needed to be escalated to a higher level of&nbsp;support&nbsp;for which there would be an associated cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, The PC is only 4 months old. It came with Windows preinstalled I was using a Microsoft Windows service. That service had a bug. Should I really be expected to shoulder the cost of resolving that issue? Absolutely not. Asking me to pay for that support
 time is the same as asking me to pay to regain (full, unlimited) access to that account. I appreciate that this is not ransomware in the true sense but I was certainly being held to ransom over that particular issue and it felt lousy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, onwards and upwards. Next purchase - a Chromebook!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best..</p>

<h2>            Downgrading from windows 10 to windows 8 or 8.1 after 30 days &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Ok so my laptop came with windows 8 originally and now i have made the big mistake of upgrading to windows 10 and not knowing what i would get myself into !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i never thought it would affect my games as they all recommend minimum windows 7/8 and they were all fine with 8.1 as well so i assumed nothing will be wrong with them with windows 10 !!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have bought new games which i cannot install and i so believe it's because of windows 10 not that they could be faulty themselves !!! either way i really want to go back to either windows 8 or 8.1 but 1 month has already passed (i wasn't playing much during
 the time to notice problems !!!! ) and i don't know what to do i don't want to reset my laptop i downloaded way too many things which were complicated and took forever i just can't be bothered having them all gone and trying to re-download everything i have
 !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>please tell me if there is any way i could possibly go back to windows 8 without loosing anything!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>or can i somehow do something about my games to be compatible with windows 10????</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

            <p>hey,</p>
<p>Unfortunately you cannot go back to windows 8/8.1 directly.You have to do a clean Install of windows 8.1 using an ISO.You may take a backup of the files, but backing up apps is tough.</p>
<p>You may use a 3rd party application to backup the apps, not sure it would work or not.</p>
<p>Just search application backup and restore software's on your favorite search engine</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 8.1 Installation Media Creation Tool</a></strong></p>
<p>Try to run your games in compatibility mode with windows 8.1.Can be done by right clicking the .exe, selecting troubleshoot compatibility option.<br />

<h3> larry.mcj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Email Notification in Windows 8</h2>
                    I can't get this to work on my own Windows 8 computer, but yesterday I convinced a friend to switch to Outlook.com and I configured everything for her.&nbsp; I setup a Microsoft Account and then an Outlook.com account...everything went perfectly smooth.&nbsp; I
 even moved all her folders and email from Outlook 2007 to the new Outlook.com account.<br />
<br />
When I was finished...without doing anything special...there was an Outlook.com icon on her Windows 8 Task Bar and it has an email notification badge on the lower right corner that shows the number of unread emails in her inbox. I have tried everything to get
 this on my own Windows 8 computer, but can't figure it out.&nbsp; I have the Outlook.com icon there, but it does not display the notification badge for the number of unread emails in my inbox.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Thanks, Geethu, but that's not what I asked in my original post...I already have the email notification in the upper right. In the "Desktop View" looking at the Task Bar...you'll see the Mail Icon (blue Outlook.com icon).&nbsp; That's the icon that displays
 a badge with the unread email count on the new Win 8 computer I configured for a friend.&nbsp; If she has three unread emails waiting in her inbox, there will be a "3" badge on the lower-right of this icon in the task bar.<br />

            <p>Your Microsoft account log in may be the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I also can't download any apps from the store along with extensions&nbsp;but&nbsp;I have found that logging in to my computer with a local account instead of a Microsoft account gets things working properly for a while but you have to log into your Microsoft
 account in the store to download items from the store. If I try and download more than one or two items at one time especially if&nbsp;I start downloading items listed in My Library I start getting the Try again later Something happened at our end message and&nbsp;sometimes
 have to sign out of my Microsoft account to get things working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a computer on the Insider Program that was set up exactly the same to log in to my Microsoft account on boot up that I had never seen any store problems on that I see will start to get the downloading problem if I try downloading items from My
 Library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried logging in to my computer as another person (My dog in my case) without a Microsoft account and found that my computer worked way better and faster than I have seen it work for a long time.</p>

Have you tried going to Settings =&gt; Apps and features, uninstalling the faulty extension and then trying again in the Store? This fixed it for me.

            Extensions for Edge were giving me the Windows Store error&nbsp;0x87E10BC5. Resetting the Store did not work, even after receiving all the updates as of 8/28/2016. What did work for me was first going to
<strong>Apps &amp; Features </strong>and uninstalling the apps/extensions, resetting the Store using
<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>, going to the <strong>Windows Store</strong> to install the apps/extensions again, and finally going to Edge
<strong>and waiting for the extension to appear</strong>. It is a bit of a concern that after Windows Store says the app/extension is installed and going to Edge
<strong>Extensions </strong>and not seeing the extension.

<h2>            Unable to use skype on MacBookAir since the latest update</h2>
                    <pre><span>Since the last Skype update in the fall of 2017, on my Macbook-Air (OS 10.13.4) I can't call even though I have a USA and Canada subscription for several years and have never had a problem before. On April 9 Skype sent me the receipt of my subscription USA and Canada for 2018, Order reference: 8331000003052332646
Total amount: EUR 25.38! BUT This payment does not appear on the screen when I open SKYPE on my computer! When I type a landline number in Canada, the server tells me that I do not have a subscription and suggest me to buy one for Canada!

What should I do to make my subscription count and to call?
Thank you in advance for a solution.

<h2>            I have genuine Windows 7. Tonight I find it not validated. WHY</h2>
                    New to this forum, rather unhappy, <br />
<br />
Having been online most of the day, having gone downstairs and watched a movie, then coming back up I find Microsoft claims my Windows is not genuine.<br />
<br />
Is this for real? <br />
<br />
I have had this genuine copy of Windows installed on this machine since I built this PC.
<br />
<br />
Now I have to go into a loft that is full of storage and spend my next free day rummaging for the original package my Windows OS came in because Microsoft messed up and is falsely claiming I do not have a genuine windows OS.
<br />
<br />
So tell me, how does a validated genuine Windows OS suddenly become unvalidated? <br />
<br />

========== About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys - Credit Andre Da Costa ==========</p>
<p><br />
"About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p><br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use."</p>

<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to </p>

<p>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to </p>

 your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</font></p>

            This was purchased as a new unopened full package genuine Windows 7 Ultimate with 64bit and 32bit discs.&nbsp; It has been running for over two years.<br />
<br />
I have just spent half the day clearing my loft to get at the original packaging, with the genuine Microsoft seal (certificate of authenticity) broken as it was by me on the 1st day I opened the case to install in this PC back in 07/10, with many of my programs
 showing install on the 25th. With the original code still adhered to the inlay card where I wanted to keep it safe.
<br />
<br />
Validated and ran from that date without any problems until as stated in the above post.<br />
<br />
I have used Microsoft security essentials since it's release also, with a re-install on the 27/09/12 and last night
<u>only</u> after a restart it then stated I was not running genuine software and had to resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />
Still no explanation as to why Microsoft now claim my genuine Windows install is not genuine. Why it is blocked, or what other PC is using this. This is what I get.
<br />
<br />
The product key used to activate Windows on your PC is already in use on another PC or has been blocked by Microsoft. Not to worry, we can help you with that.<br />
<br />
On checking the above "HowToTell" link, it indeed looks like I may well have been ripped off, the gold hologram ring upon the disc is a foil sticker that can be scratched off with some force, and not embedded into the disc plastic, though around the center
 has an embedded hologram stating "Puerto Rico" and "Microsoft" that changes to "Made By Microsoft" and "Genuine" when tilted.<br />
<br />
One extremely genuine looking retail package, no different to the others I have seen, now apparently after all this time NOT genuine after all, only verified due to the disc outer hologram not being fully embedded and Microsoft deciding after it being validated
 since 25/07/10 to now invalidate my install. <br />
<br />
Rated by Microsoft as genuine from 25/07/10 - until 01/02/13 when they all of a sudden decide it is now NOT genuine. And I should trust this I guess.<br />
<br />
After two years I doubt I will get my money back. Now I have to save up £175 to buy another retail copy of W7 Ultimate 64bit, which for all I know, as genuine as it looks, hologram and all, may in future be invalidated by Microsoft if they change their mind
 again.<br />

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>For MSDN Keys:-</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>MS can only act once a key hits a threshold (and they won't tell an outsider what that threshold is, understandably). They then have to put it through internal systems to ensure
 that all relevant parties are informed, just in case it's an oversight - then it enters the queue for the next update to the system. I have no idea how often the WAT checking system is updated, but I would suspect that it's no more than weekly because of admin
 and timing issues. The internal MS processes could therefore take easily a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p>
<span>It therefore depends on how close to the end of a vendors sales list you are, and how quickly he's selling them.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The cannier ones will sell just enough to stay under the threshold for each product (MSDN subs include a huge number of products), until they've maximised the profits, then try
 and flood the market before disappearing into the sunset, laden with your cash. This could take anything up to a year or more.</span></p>

            So a bit of a horror story this has turned into.<br />
<br />
I bought this online over 2 years ago. It was advertised as a genuine sealed retail Windows Ultimate package, and as far as I could tell was genuine.
<br />
The retailer sold PC components and software just like every other PC related online retailer, from what I can remember it was cheaper than anywhere else at that time. As upon receipt the software looked genuine, upon install was validated originally by MS
 as genuine, and never gave me any problems, I had no reason to take note of the retailer, their future business practices, addresses or whatever else they did or sold.
<br />
<br />
After this OS, most further purchases of hardware and software have been with two retailers who give me free delivery due to being a member of their forums, they also happen to be in my experience two of the best, most competitive priced, and offer consistent
 superb customer service. Sadly at this time they have no copies of Windows 7 Ultimate retail, nor I the money.
<br />
<br />
To summarize.<br />
<br />
In 2010 I bought Windows 7 from an online store. It was advertised as genuine, sealed, and on arrival had what looked like every other W7 Ultimate retail package I had seen in pictures and in stores.&nbsp; It looked like any other small retailer with average products
 and an OS that was cheaper than the others. Much like my Corsair Dominator GT memory purchase made with another retailer, that thankfully was genuine with a healthy saving.<br />
<br />
I have ran this operating system validated by Microsoft as Genuine for over two years. Since 25/07/10.<br />
<br />
I bought this operating system before 25/07/2010. Sadly I did not leave the receipt in the box, therefor further searching of my loft will ensue tomorrow. It was so long ago, and I have bought so much stuff from online retailers, that I can't even remember
 the damn name of the retailer at this time. That's what you get for impulse purchasing on Google.
<br />
<br />
As such I doubt I will have any fruitful ending to this horror story. And can only sit here miffed and despondent as to why it can take so many years for apparently valid genuine purchase to suddenly be blocked.<br />
<br />
It was still validated as genuine by Microsoft on 27/09/2012 as I had a reinstall of Microsoft security essentials.<br />
<br />
Microsoft security essentials and Genuine Microsoft updates have been running fine from 25/07/2010 right up until late night on the 1st of February 2013.
<br />
<br />
The only discrepancies I see is that the gold foil hologram on the discs is not inside the plastic, and can be scratched off with a little force. And (thank you for the above you tube link) as noted in the above linked video, my COA decal states made in the
 USA. <br />
<br />
So I guess this serves as a warning to others, please be careful when you buy Windows OS from online vendors, not just the small unknown stores, but inc Amazon and reputable PC hardware and software retailers.<br />
<br />
Even if you have a validated genuine install, bought from any retailer, check your discs and packaging, if OEM I guess you have to keep your fingers crossed.<br />
<br />
No matter how genuine your packaging or discs look they could be copies, and having Microsoft validate your new or years old Windows 7 install is no guarantee you can sleep at night. You cannot guarantee that Microsoft will not be invalidating it two or three
 years after purchase. <br />
<br />
To this MS community, thank you for the replies and given explanations, it will take a bit of time to sink in, I am still trying to get my head around the fact that I have been running as I believed a genuine validated Windows 7 install all this time, only
 to find out years later iI was conned.<br />
<br />
Not only have I lost money on the OS, I am also losing out on online subscriptions, wasting a broadband connection, and lost a lot of time when I have very little spare. Now I hope I have the time to save all my files and such.
<br />
<br />
Thankyou again all, and cheers for letting me vent a little frustration here.<br />

            Well thanks to bad housekeeping on old email accounts further investigation shows I was mistaken with from where I purchased this. It was not an online retail store but eBay. Sold as a Genuine unopened W7 Ultimate retail. It was buy it now. Quick recorded
 delivery too.<br />
<br />
Paid for on the 20th July 2010, posted on the 21st, and I had a couple of other PC parts coming that week hence the build on the 25th.<br />
<br />
I have not yet found the paper receipt, but have all the transaction/payment details on PayPal, and a confirmation email from the seller regarding shipping.
<br />
<br />
I have followed the recommended procedure that the MS site links led to regarding counterfeit software, filled in the online forms and details, and agreed to package this W7 retail box and contents, codes and keys, whatever purchase and seller details I have
 at hand or still in my emails and online, and will post them to the address given by MS.
<br />
<br />
I guess the lack of genuine paper receipt will not help regarding complimentary software, I am hopeful a screen print of the PayPal transaction and corresponding email will suffice. I guess the important thing is at least reporting it and sending them this
 retail box in the hope that every little helps.<br />
<br />
Pretty gutted to be honest. But the replies gave here have been very helpful and interesting!<br />

    <title>Surface Pro keeps dropping its wireless network connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karlos.sp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro keeps dropping its wireless network connection intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I recently picked up a used OG Surface Pro and am having issues with the wireless network connection occasionally. This happens with varying frequency. When this happens, the computer stays connected to the access point, but cannot reach any local network
 resources or the Internet. Pinging the default gateway results in "request timed out." Disconnecting from the wireless network and reconnecting usually fixes the problem, but only temporarily before it comes back again. Sometimes it fixes itself on its own
 after a few dozen seconds or after a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a full list of things that I've tested, checked, and/or tried, based on suggestions seen in other forum threads:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Ran a manual check using Windows Update to make sure that all the drivers are up to date, especially for the Marvell AVASTAR 350N. They are (version 14.69.24054.176, dated 5/23/2014).</li><li>Unchecked "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" on the wireless card's sheet in the device manager.</li><li>Changed the power saving mode for the wireless card on my current power plan (to "maximum performance").</li><li>Tried disabling packet coalescing &amp; selective suspend on the wireless card.</li><li>Changed MTU for the Wi-Fi adapter from 1500 to 1400.</li><li>Tried various different versions of the AVASTAR driver, including 14.69.24019.88 (dated 2/19/2013).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the troubleshooting, I have reset all values and settings that I changed, in order to keep the troubleshooting environment clean, predictable, and free of additional problems that could be caused by all of this messing around with the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is currently running the latest stable build of Windows 10 Pro (15063, "Creator Edition") 64bit. This is a fairly clean installation. Any ideas short of starting over?</p>

<p>On the offchance that the cause of the problem was software or some kind of weird remnant from a previous upgrade installation of Windows, I clean installed the latest build (16299, "fall creator" edition) and loaded up just a core set of software. Same
 deal. I also tested by tethering through my phone (connected to the same access point) and found the connection to be perfectly stable (no high ping response time variability, no temporary loss of connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind, the problem appears to be exclusive to the AVASTAR on this PC. I'll try connecting to a different access point sometime this week, (if possible) but I have my doubts that this'll make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, I can say with some degree of confidence that the problem is caused by one of three things:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A hardware problem</li><li>Driver incompatibility with newer builds of Windows 10</li><li>Hardware incompatibility with newer editions of Windows</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Marvell AVASTAR 350N hasn't received a driver update since 2014, it is safe to assume that it likely never will. With this in mind, the only fix will be to wait for a newer build of Windows that works properly with it, (not likely a priority for
 Microsoft at this point) keep exploring new workarounds, or to keep going back to earlier builds until I find one that works. I'll spend another day or two collecting data and making my voice heard on the feedback hub before taking that tour back through earlier
 builds. That is, unless somebody here has some <strong>real </strong>tips or suggestions.</p>

<p>Quick update: I tried a clean install of Windows 10 build 14393 ("Anniversary edition") today, but the issue still persists. Either this thing doesn't play nice with Windows 10 or there's something wrong with the hardware. I'll try 8.1 and 8 in the coming
 days as time permits and keep this thread updated with the results.</p>

            Just to follow up on this again, I did go ahead and clean-install Windows 8.1 this morning, and, so far, it actually seems to be working all right. That said, the problem was pretty intermittent before too, so I'm not holding my breath, but this is a positive
 sign so far. If 8.1 ends up working fine, I'll likely just stick with it though, even if it means giving up Windows 10's night mode and (slightly) improved high-density scaling support.

<p>Well, it's been over a week now and there have been absolutely no problems under Windows 8.1. As best as I can tell this is a Windows 10-exclusive problem (at least for builds 14393 and newer, as I did not test 10586 or 10240). There are some other things
 that I would've liked to have been able to try, (such as disabling USB selective suspend) but since I've had such a surprisingly-good experience with 8.1, I'm just going to stick with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the answer is that there is no real answer. I was expecting this to be a hardware defect, but since it works 100% of the time on Windows 8.1, that obviously cannot be the case. The only conclusion I can offer and solution that I can give to other
 folks who might be encountering this problem is simply to dump Windows 10. 8.1 is actually really nice on the Surface Pro anyway (at least after it has been spruced up a bit with a
<a href="https://liveordietm.deviantart.com/art/AeroByDesign-For-Windows-8-1-Update-1-401771941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="AeroByDesign Custom Theme for Windows 8.1 (">
better visual style</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To conclude, this problem has been consistently replicated on Windows 10 build 16299, ("fall creator's edition") 15063, ("creator's edition") and 14393, ("anniversary edition") with no reliable solution found. Using Windows 8.1 instead of these various Windows
 10s has been the only true cure. I know it's not the answer a lot of people wanted to hear, (especially the die-hard 8/8.1 haters) but it might be the only way to get things going 100% with the Surface Pro (and presumably the Pro 2 as well, which uses a similar
 chipset and the same wireless card).</p>
