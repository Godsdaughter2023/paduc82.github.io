                    for the last few months i've had the same error message for every program i've tried to install- "Access violation at address 0041510A in module<br />
'ffdshow-rev3128_20091108_xxl.exe'. Write of address 00400000"&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not just w/ ffdshow, it's w/ ever program.&nbsp; i'm unable to install even when i try to install as admin.&nbsp;&nbsp; now it is a gateway, so i don't know if it considers me the true admin since i didn't
 install the o/s.&nbsp; it's the first prepackaged pc i've bought, i usually build my systems, so i've never had an issue w/ being the admin.&nbsp; i suspect the problem is a registry issue, but i'm unsure and unsure about how to fix it.&nbsp; i tried running a registry fix
 and that hasn't seemed to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i was able to install for the first 6-9 months i've had this system, but lately, all i get is this error message.&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone had this problem before?

<p><span><span>Hi Nikandjer,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the following methods.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run an online scan. :
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Vista Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool is a program that you can use to run various tests
 on the physical memory installed on your computer. This utility performs a series of tests on the physical memory and lists any errors that are found. In this way you can determine if the problems you are encountering when using your computer may be related
 to the RAM going bad or some other problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click start</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type memory diagnostic tool in the start search box and press enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Windows memory diagnostic tool opens.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Choose the option “Restart now and check for problems”<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/built-in-diagnostics.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/built-in-diagnostics.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>It might be a problem with windows installer. Try to install the latest windows installer.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942288</span></a><br />
<span>Check if windows installer service is set to manual.<br />
Type services.msc in the start search box, which opens the services windows and windows installer service is towards the bottom of that window.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Create a test user account and try to install programs and see if you are getting the same error.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
User Accounts and Family Safety</strong> (or clicking <strong>User Accounts</strong>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking
<strong>User Accounts</strong>. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Click
<strong>Manage another account</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Click
<strong>Create a new account</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click
<strong>Create Account</strong>. </span></span></li></ol>

<p>hey Bindu,&nbsp; thanks for the above post.&nbsp; i tried all of the steps you recommended to no avail.&nbsp; the online scan found nothing (as have all the other security scans i've done w/ CA, SuperAnti-Spyware, and windows defender).&nbsp; i ran memtest and the windows memory
 test.&nbsp; memtest said everything was fine, and the windows mem test claimed i had no disc drive (despite the fact that the program was running from the disc during reboot).&nbsp; and i've also tried to setup another account and got the same error messages.&nbsp; i had
 actually tried all these before i posted, but gave them another shot.&nbsp; i've also used windows and a third party registry scans, both claim to find and fix the errors they found.&nbsp; but that has had no effect.&nbsp; thinking back to running "microsoft security essentials
 online scan" it did report an unfixable error.&nbsp; it didn't tell me what the error was though.<br />
today, i tried to install another program (from giveawayoftheday.com)&nbsp; and the error i got was as follows-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
"Unable to execute file:<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\Icevc\ICEINIT.EXE</p>
<p>CreateProcess failed; code 5.<br />
Access is denied"<br />
<br />
once again, this seems to be the error i get trying to install at least half of the programs i try.&nbsp; the only differnce is the .exe name in the error.&nbsp; this error message is in a smaller window that says "setup" on it's top banner.&nbsp; then&nbsp;after i close the window,
 there is still a "setup" tab on my task bar and i have to go into task manager to close the tab (nothing happens when i click the tab).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
the error message i described in the first post is the error i get the other half of the time trying to install.&nbsp; it's a longer window, and following closing that, a window pops up telling me there was an error w/ install and gives me the option to input that
 it "installed correctly"&nbsp; or to "re-install w/ proper settings", neither option does anything.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
this is the problem on my vista 64-bit o/s that's running a amd quad core, and 6 gigs of ram,&nbsp; i'm also getting similar error messages on my old xp system that runs is supposed to run 2.2 w/ 1.5 of ram (that system also wants to run at 1.1gig instead of 2.2,
 that could be bios).&nbsp; i can't seem to install anything on my windows systems period.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
what can i do?&nbsp; i'm not really in the mood to reinstall the o/s on both pc's.&nbsp; the xp install is only about 4 months old and the vista a year.</p>

    <title>System Recovery Error and AppxStaging folder&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pc-mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Recovery Error and AppxStaging folder&#58;</h2>
                    By performing a system configuration restore, I got the error 0x80070005 which translating from my language says more or not:<br />
<br />
Error while restoring the directory from the recovery point.<br />
Origin: AppxStaging<br />
Destination: %ProgramFile%\WindowsApps<br />
<br />
The problem is not so much the failure of the restoration, because I manually resolved the problem I had, but the fact that the recovery error has subtracted about 10 GB of free space, and subsequent attempts to recover them with integrated tools (automatic
 maintenance and disk cleanup) didn't work.<br />
<br />
So after deleting all recovery points and restarting the PC, checking the folder "System volume information" with the tool SpaceSniffer, I saw that there is the AppxStaging folder that occupies 19.5GB.<br />
<br />
So I went to examine another 2 PCs I have at home, one with win8 and the other with win10, and neither of them has the AppxStaging folder in "C:\System Volume Information\SystemRestore".<br />
<br />
So it's correct to think that the 10GB lost as a result of the error are used by this folder, which due to the error has not been deleted? Whereas it's not the first time I've got this error.<br />
<br />
In this case I would try to delete it, hoping to be able to do it with ShapeSniffer, and then try to create a new restore point, and perform a recovery later, to see if deleting the folder also solves the problem, but I would first be sure that the 10GB lost
 are actually those used by the AppxStaging folder, to avoid losing further space, without then knowing how to get it back.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my English

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do is a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />This is the most stable method to advance to the latest version and because it reinstalls Windows should resolve most problems like yours.  
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I updated the 21 of this month, although not with the tool, but through windows update, while the problem of restore failure, I had already happened before, but I don't want to do a clean installation, because I have many programs that I should re-install
 and configure, so I prefer to look for an alternative solution, or to disable the system restore permanently, and postpone the reinstallation of windows, only if I had big problems in the future.</p>

            Are you saying that you have upgraded to Version 1803 or not?  You can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.
<br />
<br /> System Restore is something else:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> and should always be turned on.

            Hello F Sexton,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
You tried performing the steps as Ramesh suggested and saved it as another file somewhere?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Click Start Orb &gt; type services in the searchbox<br />
&nbsp;- Right-click services in results above<br />
&nbsp;- Click Author<br />
&nbsp;- Maximize services<br />
&nbsp;- Click File &gt; Save as<br />
<br />
Rename the file and save to location of your choice, when you use the shortcut to open services, it should open maximized.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

            <p>I saw on here you said there was no rewards for April except extra entries. Let me remind you what your main support page says and why unless stated otherwise we should have got something. For April Download any Game pass title and play for 10 hours or more for a chance to win a Scorpio gold plated Xbox one. It does not state that it is the only reward nor does it state there were no other rewards so who's the **** here? How hard is it to say ( only extra entries will be rewarded this month) easy right? No you wanted to lie to us instead to keep subscriptions up or not have anyone cancel it last month since there was no reward so most of us were thinking the entries were more a bonus not the only thing and here is from your support page (needs to change if your not doing rewards anymore not got one since December of 2017)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Goals is a fun way to get rewarded for being a member. Each month, a new Goal is posted in the Xbox Game Pass Lounge and everyone who complete
<p>Prizes vary by month, but include:</p>
<ul><li>Xbox Live Gold</li><li>Xbox Gift Card</li><li>Movies</li><li>DLC</li><li>…and more!</li></ul><p>See that Guarnteed to win a prize entries to a sweepstakes is not a prize unless purchase is necessary which your terms and conditions say it is not so I think I made my point here if you wish to not loose subs in the future make sure your clear with the details as far as I'm concerned I never saw the entries so how do I know I was given anything? Faith in you is asking alot. I would like to see these supposed extra entries to a Xbox that I have yet to see anyone post they ever won one as far as I'm concerned it's a bold face lie to keep us subbing to Game pass. Which after my sub is up I won't be renewing and going to make sure none of my family and friends do anymore either.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I have several updates that fail to install with no error code. I have a 64x Vista Ulatimate OS SP-2. I went to windows download center and tried to install the updates from there with no success So I downloaded all the failed update to my computer and was
 sucessful with installing a couple of hot fixes and one other but I have, even tryiing Fixit from my computer offline and online and cannot get these four to update.&nbsp; I have tried a dozen different suggestions from searching this post to no avail and now after
 days of trying I am posting my own issue. The MS support site sent me back here where I tried first. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>My desktop icons flicker really fast everytime I start up Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My desktop icons flicker really fast everytime I start up Windows</h2>
                    <p>I have used the Microsoft Safety Scanner to scan my computer since my Norton wasn't picking up anything because I knew something was wrong (yes Norton is up-to-date). The Microsoft Safety Scanner has picked up 4 trojans and it said it has removed them. Usually
 the desktop icons flicker automactically if I just simply click on the desktop and doesn't stop until I click on the taskbar. I clicked on the desktop after the viruses were removed to see if that was the problem and no more flickering. I thought I had finally
 fixed my computer until I turned it back on today and after&nbsp;Windows started up it started doing the flickering again. I also have tried system restore and it said it wasn't successful. If it wasn't the viruses that has been causing it, then what is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I'm currently running on Windows Vista SP2 and I'm not sure about the make or model of my monitor but I know that this is the driver that it has "Dell ST2210 (Analog)" and the driver that the is the Display adapters is "ATI Radeon HD 4350". My computer
 is a Dell Studio 540 and it is a desktop.</p>

<h3> kilizone  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;Microsoft NEEDS TO KNOW&#42; Flawed reputation system</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to address a huge flaw in xbox reputation system. Myself and hundreds of others have been discussing it on one of the most trafficked websites on the internet. I'm hoping to bring awareness to this issue in hopes that someone here will do their
 job and bring this problem to someone who can do something about it. I have recently been a victim of the flawed reputation system, players making false claims against my account causing my reputation to go down, thus making it harder for me to find players
 in matchmaking. I'm worried my reputation will continue to fall until the point where i can hardly play at all, and i have had my gamertag for 8 years with no issue. Not until the xbox one. And in the last 2 months when i decided to rank up in matchmaking
 on halo, my reputation just instantly started declining. I wanted to state that&nbsp;I just spent 45 minutes on the phone with an xbox customer support MANAGER who told me that his very own friend he played halo with was suspended for two weeks because he was really
 good. I wonder if someone who works for customer support would make that up, let alone a manager. He should be managing this forum, because what we need is people who want to help us, not regurgitate and show us how powerful you are. The manager on the phone
 told me I should start a movement. So that's what I'm doing. I will continue to make threads until my issue is addressed in a constructive way. All allegations on my gamertag have no evidence to back them because they are completely false. I have been using
 this gamertag for 8 years and never have had an issue. This problem is very common amongst other players in my skill range and that is unacceptable because the dedicated people like me are vital to this community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/3fm549/xbox_reputation_falling_because_im_a_high_rank/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/3fm549/xbox_reputation_falling_because_im_a_high_rank/</span></span></a></p>
<p>On another note i would like to address the generic response i recieved, probably from a robot.</p>
<p>As according to "XBLPET Foxtrot"</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Your reputation has fallen due to negative feedback filed against you by members of the Xbox Live community. The conduct that caused this may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>-Communicating with other Xbox Live users in an offensive, derogatory, or disruptive manner</p>
<p><span>(I almost always play with friends, I don't even talk to the other team, most of the time I use party chat or Skype. So how do I communicate offensively? I have had harassing messages sent to me after beating players
 plenty of times, but I'm the disruptive one?)</span></p>
<p>-Utilizing unauthorized hardware/software/account modifications to gain an advantage or disrupt the competitive landscape of Xbox Live</p>
<p><span>(I don't even really understand what this means? Modifications, is that like hacking or something? If so would I not be console banned permanently since it would detect these things?)</span></p>
<p>-Exploiting game vulnerabilities or glitches to gain an unfair competitive advantage</p>
<p><span>(Well, this is pretty confusing as well. Since I play online and everyone can pretty much do the exact same thing, I don't even know what would fit into this category. If there is a vulnerability or glitch that is unfair
 would it not be removed by the developer. Otherwise you cannot punish the player, because how would you even know something in the game "is not fair to do")</span></p>
<p>-Killing your teammates, quitting early, griefing/trolling other players, or not exhibiting good sportsmanship</p>
<p><span>(Hmmm.. well, the last 2 months I have ranked all the way up to 44 in Halo 2 Classic on Halo: The Master Chief Collection. 50 is the highest rank, I don't think I killed my teammates and quit out to get all the way
 there. Also, I do not "troll" other players, rarely do I even speak to them let alone waste my time *** with them. Good sportsmanship? Is it bad sportsmanship to beat the same players 5 times in a row? Because I can't help that I'm better.)</span></p>
<p>If your reputation reaches "Avoid Me" status, you'll most likely be matched with other low reputation players, and you'll begin to lose privileges like being able to broadcast your gameplay using Twitch. To improve your reputation score, interact well with
 others on Live by playing online multiplayer matches without receiving negative feedback.</p>

<p>To address some of what you have said. From the code of conduct: Do not exploit game vulnerabilities or glitches. Pretty simple. It does not matter if others do it, because they are breaking the code of conduct when they do. Questions: Ever tea bag somebody?
 Ever get a "You're cheating", or profane message after a match, and instead of just reporting it, reply to it in a not so nice manner? Lots of things can cause somebody to leave neg feedback. The new feedback system does have checks and balances in it to stop
 false reports. I can not explain it completely because I do not even know how it works. Only Enforcement knows that. Nobody will receive a ban or suspension for being too good. Things do not work that way. You only receive those after it is proven that you
 broke the TOU or COC, I do not know why phone support would tell you that. I would also warn you that if you spam the forums, you could receive a suspension or ban for doing so. You only need one post to make your concerns known. I suggest, that you post in
 this section of the forums: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4276.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../4276.aspx</a>. Explain the situation and explain your concerns that there is a problem with the rep system and HALO. You may not get an answer on that forum as many times they reply in a PM, so keep track of your private messages. That forum
 is really the only way to express your concerns, because this is an Enforcement action, Support can not help you with Enforcement concerns. Posting ongoing messages on the Support forums really will not help you. The spirit of the new rep system is to try
 to get people to be decent to each other, win or loose. I believe that is a good thing. If there is a problem with HALO and the rep system, Enforcement will look into it. But is being decent to each other really that difficult?</p>

            <p>Hi there, sometimes your anti virus will stop at 99% whilst it checks the download. Had this problem once before. Also this article may or may not assist:</p>
<p><br />
Internet Explorer error "connection timed out" when server does not respond<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181050</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be that the server is taking too long to respond and is timing out.</p>

            I am also having same type of problem. People used to give me solution like antivirus may be causing this error. But last night only i have installed XP SP3, i did not have any antivirus plus my firewall is disabled.
<br />
<br />
According to me i think error is in my Operating System, and the solution for downloading the file is : DOWNLOAD ANYTHING IN RAR FORMAT. exe files may be stoping at 99% but download rar file, it will be 100% download. For example for downloading mozilla, instead
 of typing download mozilla , you type download mozilla rar file.<br />
<br />
Thats the solution from my side. And i am tackling it.<br />
<br />

            Good day! I also currently experiencing this problem for almost 6 months. I'm using Win XP SP3 with stable internet connection around 4MBPS. In my opinion this problem is causes by virus that only runs in Win XP SP3, without AV only Deep Freeeze. I discover
 it by downloading the same file using my netbook running 32-bit Win 7 with AVG. Then I transfer the file using USB Flash Drive (no detection of infections) then its done. I always doing this every time I can't DL or patch files on my XP. As of now I'm still
 searching a solution to remove this unknown virus. Kindly help us for the solution, Thanks!<br />

<p>Sorry but until&nbsp;now I&nbsp;do not have any solution for this. To my frustration, I upgraded my system and upgrade my OS to Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. My problem solved!</p>

<h2>            Changing the Product Key in Windows 8.1 Pro OEM</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to clone a HDD on PC1 and install it on PC2 which has identical hardware.&nbsp; After the clone HDD is installed on PC2, I'd like to change the product key.&nbsp; The license on PC1 is already activated.&nbsp; Is this possible and will it cause any licensing issues?&nbsp;
 I know that the product key can be changed with the "slui" command or going to the "PC Info" page on Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Willie</p>

<p>You don't transfer OEM licenses.</p>
<p>Start again on the second PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the clarification on Windows 8.1 licensing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC1 and PC2 are Intel NUC PCs that do not come with HDD/OS installed.&nbsp; I am trying to clone the HDDs so that I would not have to go through the entire Windows installation process and the installation process for other 3rd party software that need to be
 loaded in Windows.&nbsp; I know that in Windows 10, the Product Key does not need to be entered immediately during installation and that Microsoft allows the user 30 days to enter the Product Key from the date of installation.&nbsp; I know this option is not available
 in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</span>"&nbsp; This is the reason why I want to change
 the Product key on the 2nd HDD.&nbsp; I want to change it so that I would not be in violation of Microsoft licensing terms.&nbsp; If I install the clone HDD on PC2, will it load into Windows and allow me to change the Product Key for a brief moment?</p>

            It's possible that Movie Maker is having trouble with the .mp3 file. Try converting it to .wma or .wav and see if it works with that audio file instead.

<br />mein Name ist Matthias und arbeite als unabhängiger Berater, ich werde dir bei deinem Problem helfen.
<br />
<br />Also abgesehen davon das Windows NT keinelerei Support mehr hat und daher dringend durch ein neueres System angeschafft werden sollte -&gt; Wird das einfachste Sein SMB/v1 unter Windows 10 als Client zu aktivieren.
<br />
<br />Powershell mit Administratoren Rechten starten:
<br />Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol
<br />
<br />SMB1 ist über 30 Jahre alt und gilt als unsicher und wird nicht mehr supported, vom Einsatz wird stark abgeraten.

    <title>System Issues with Uninstalling Corel PSP Pro Photo and failure of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grumpymik  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Issues with Uninstalling Corel PSP Pro Photo and failure of System Restore to function</h2>
                    I recently had a very reliable XP machine die. I replaced it with a new computer a little over 2 months ago. I had some material transferred from my XP system to the new one (which is running Windows Vista Home Premium on an HP computer with an AMD Phenom
 quad core processor and 8 gigs RAM. I have been disappointed with the inability of the OS to support some of my favorite programs (Print Artist 12, Adobe Photoshop Elements 6) and have been struck by the seeming characteristic of this system to fail in odd
 and therefore more frustrating ways. But right now, aside from this general discouragement I seem to be having 2 problems of substance that I am hopeful you can help with.<br />
<br />
1. I recently installed a trial version of Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 and then purchased a boxed edition of the Ultimate version of this program. I cannot install the new version over the trial version. Further, I cannot uninstall the trial version because
 I do not have "sufficient administrative access" to do so. There is only one user account set up on this system and it does have full administrative access. I have tried setting the program to run in XP compatibility mode. I have tried uninstalling in Safe
 mode. I have tried changing the user access setting for this program. I have tried setting the program to run with administrative privileges. I have made sure that my version of Vista home premium 64 bit is fully up to date. I have tried restoring the system
 to several restore points prior to the installation of of Paint Shop Pro Photo. None of this has helped. The system has refused to restore to any of the restore points that have have selected. I have e-mailed Corel support on this and have yet to hear from
 them. I have e-mailed HP. Their first recommendation was to do a full system restore (which entails re-formatting the entire hard drive if I understand the procedure correctly). I am reluctant to be in a position where I have to do this because it strikes
 me that there should be an easier way and that if there is not I am concerned that this might be a predictor of having to do this extreme procedure again and to have to do so often (especially given that I have NO earthly idea what steps led to the OS becoming
 corrupted). HP's second recommendation was a recapitulation of measures that I had already undertaken (and had already reported as having undertaken them). Their third suggestion is to download a special program Advanced Uninstaller Pro which I may have to
 pay for. So I am looking in the first place for guidance as to how I might be able to uninstall this program without reformatting the hard drive or having to pay for a program to do this.<br />
<br />
2. The System Restore function, in failing to restore to each of the 4 restore points I tried has returned "exception error" messages in every case. I am concerned that the System Restore might itself be malfunctioning and I would appreciate any attempts to
 help me understand what has caused this and what, if anything, I can do (short of reformatting the hard drive entirely) to fix this.<br />
<br />
3. Let's suppose the best solution to the above is to re-format the hard drive and to re-build the system from scratch. Are there things I need to know about this system that would help keep me from having to do so every few months (I got the system in June)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your consideration,<br />

<p><span>Hey
<span><span><span>grumpymik</span>
</span>,</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can<span>not</span> install this program, the best way to remove this program would
 be by using Windows Clean up Utility. Here is a link that will give description on the Windows Clean up utility:
</span></span></p>

</a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Use this Windows clean up utility and try<span> to</span> remove Corel Paint Shop.
</span></p>
<p><span>Now regarding the System Restore failing on your computer, I suggest that you boot your computer to ‘Safe Mode’ and try to do a System Restore
 on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Also try to use a different restore point. System restore sometimes does not complete if you have corrupted restore points.</span></p>
<p><span>Give these steps a try and let us know if it works.</span></p>

Thank you for your reply. I had not seen it as I thought that there would only be a single instance of the original query in the forums and that was moved to a different location.<br />
<br />
As it happens, I already went ahead and used Advanced Uninstaller Pro (a free trial version) to remove my Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo from my system so that I could install my purchased copy. This worked well although the program's function to scan and remove
 leftover trace files did not appear to function as it should (probably because the program's functions having to do with the registry of 64 bit systems do not work as they should). However, since I was reinstalling the program this was not an issue for me.
<br />
<br />
I will keep the Windows CleanUp utility in mind if I should face this problem in the future. If I understand the documentation correctly, it appears the the Windows Clean Up utility will cause the computer to not recognize selected programs as being uninstalled
 but that it will not actually remove the program files (please correct me on this if I have misunderstood). I would imagine that then I would have to manually delete the program files.<br />
<br />
As for the System Restore issue, this was first encountered as a means to an end (trying to uninstall Paint Shop Pro Photo). This has been accomplished and I have no need (and therefore little desire) to try a system restore again at this point. I am concerned
 however, about the situation of having the System Restore function fail at each and every one of the 4 set points I tried. This causes me to wonder if my system is somehow corrupted and how I could confirm that one way or the other. I would welcome your suggestions
 on that topic.<br />
<br />
Thank you again,<br />

            Irfan-<br />
If I understand the situation, you are proposing your earlier post as a solution for the issues I raised on Friday.<br />
<br />
I readily concede that the Windows Clean Up utility might be a satisfactory solution to the uninstall problem I was having with Paint Shop Pro and I will keep it mind if I encounter such a problem in the future.<br />
<br />
I readily concede that your suggestion to try a system restore in Safe Mode and/or to try different restore points might be successful if I want to try a system restore at some point in the future. Right now, I am not wanting to do system restore since this
 was only a means to try to uninstall Paint Shop Pro.<br />
<br />
What I asked in my last post was different (perhaps I should have started a new thread. The remaining questions are:<br />
1. Whether or not the failure of the system to restore to each of the 4 different restore points suggests that the system restore function and/or the system itself could be corrupted;<br />
2. If there is a way to determine whether this corruption exists short of trying more system restore operations; and,<br />
3. If there are means to correct such problems (should they exist) short of reinstalling the system (and reformatting my hard drive).<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help so far. If you can shed additional light on these remaining issues, I would be happy to hear from you again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

                    I can insert a flash drive, and the computer accepts it, but the drive doesn't show up anywhere -I see the C drive, the D drive, but no E, F, or whatever that would be the flash drive. The "Remove ...Safely" icon recognizes the drive is there, but I cannot
 copy a file to it because it doesn't appear on the list of drives.

            I had a&nbsp;similar problem and it was hardware related.&nbsp; There were too many USB devices on my USB bus drawing power&nbsp;even though I had 6 USB ports on the motherboard.&nbsp; I bought a 7 port Belkin powered hub to solve the problem.&nbsp; A device like a flash drive
 would generate a connection beep and would show up under the safely remove hardware widget, but the drive letter would never appear.<br />
<br />
Unplug all usb devices, shut down the system and pull the power cord.&nbsp; Pull the battery if a laptop.&nbsp; Wait a minute or two to make sure all the power had drained out then turn it on and see if the flash drive works just by itself.<br />
<br />
I assume you have checked the fash drive and it is OK.

<p>Well I replaced the CPU and it ran fine for a couple of days, but now the BSOD's are back. What else could be the issue?</p>

            <p>Sorry for the lack of given information. Ill try to be more specific this time.</p>
<p>So, I took a couple of photos with my camera and deleted them soon after (deleted from photos folder on start). When I look in that folder they are gone, but when I open wats up (or any messaging app) and try to send an attachment (photo), they ask me to
 chose a folder and I choose 'camera roll' when i scroll up I can still see those photos (the ones I deleted) in selected folder.

I already have Win 10 Pro installed:&nbsp; NOTE THIS:
<p>
</p><p>APPLIES TO TOSHIBA (LAPTOP), DELL INSPIRON (TOUCH SCREEN) AND ROG ASUS WITH NVIDIA GTX SLI OVERSIZED OS TOWER:</p>
<p>*VIP INFO: each device has been installed from a Microsoft 8.1 English (BLUE)&nbsp; DSP OEI DVD - with its own key for each of the DVD is assigned to that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DELL INSPIRON: (TOUCH SCREEN) - WIN 10 PRO</strong> - unfortunately, had crashed - from Win 8.1 Pro to Win 10 (first PR edition) .. a reinstallation: success, since August installation (Win 10 Pro Anniversary Edition) - was running fine, Sept update
 literally KILLED that touch screen device... Error Code: 0xc000000001 ...</p>
<p>a) Unable to proceed, does not recognize the media drive created for it<br />
b) Attempts to recover, repair, etc - is not an option<br />
c) "Removing HDD and docking it" - a diagnostic scan shows the Operating System is corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (My question here: WHY?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&nbsp;&nbsp; )&nbsp; Starts to Win 10 Pro<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii&nbsp; )&nbsp; Opens with original Win 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii )&nbsp; Has 2 operating systems - Win 10 Anniversary and Win 8.1 Pro running</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Was finally able to access this for a brief time... using the OEM DSP DVD&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The original Win 8.1 Pro version and not the Win 10 Pro (1st Edition) or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Anniversary Edition - is the primary OS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Win 10 Pro / Win 10 Anniversary - all files intact<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Not able to boot from all of them:<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win 10 Pro (early edition)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win 10 Pro Anniversary Edition</p>
<p>* Windows 10 is on an ISO burned to ISO, Win 10 Anniversary was installed - upgraded to Win 10 Pro and now to Win 10 Pro Anniversary Edition ... Original Win 8.1 Pro files is now "history"</p>
<p>PRIMARY ERROR:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
M-DOS error:&nbsp; NO OPERATING SYSTEM FOUND<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESS ALT-CNTL-DEL<br />
Run From DISK:&nbsp; DISK READ ERROR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESS ALT-CNTL-DEL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (All Windows OS Disks were tried)</p>
<p>Diagnostic Test:&nbsp; Inside out: "Excellent"<br />
???</p>
<p>UNABLE TO REVIVE, RESTORE, OR ANYTHING - CAN NO LONGER ACCESS THAT HARD DRIVE (HDD is fine, just too many Operating Systems installed on that OEM disk) -
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHICH MEANS - "IT IS DESTROYED, WILL HAVE TO WIPE OUT HDD, REINSTALL ... BUT FROM WHICH OEM VERSION SHOULD THE CLEAN INSTALL STEM FROM?"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>TOSHIBA (LAPTOP - Non-Touch Screen) </strong>: Original Microsoft Win 8.1 Pro installed, upgraded from Win 10 Pro twice (had to revert to CLEAN INSTALLATION) ... current issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 Pro Anniversary Edition - freezes at 99%:&nbsp; deleted file folder, redo, still freezes at 99%</p>
<p>
</p><p>It attempts to install Win 10 Pro Anniversary Edition in spite of halting at 99% ... when it automatically restarts or if I have to restart or shut down and restart...</p>
<p>WIN 10 PRO ANNIVERSARY EDITION - attempts to install... and winds up with "WINDOWS IS UNABLE TO UPDATE," and rolls back to "original dated Win 10 Pro version"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION: WHAT FILES ARE ACTUALLY MISSING FROM THIS FILE FOLDER ON THE WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the ONLY working device I have left of - I do not want to wind up with absolutely no working or functional Computer! Critical!<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CUSTOM BUILT MEGA OS TOWER:&nbsp; ASUS ROG / NVIDIA SLI&nbsp;</strong> (Original BETA to Metro "8") Server/High End ... installed Win 8.1 Pro twice, original OEM version was a non-media update - that OEM disk is destroyed and disposed of in 2013 - a newer
 OEM Disk purchases, reinstalled ... functioning excellent. "Prior to Win 10 PR Release" - upgraded to Win 10 Pro via old ISO disk.&nbsp; Had all updates and upgrades over the year... and last upgrade and build is August 31, 2016...
<br />
<br />
IT IS SEVERELY CORRUPTED (even though old OEM versions had been deleted by the Installation / Upgrade itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only way to BOOT from that OS Tower is via the old OEM ISO to DVD disk - the only BUILD that will allow this Huge Tower is BUILD 1607 and that disk is beginning to be severely damaged (not able to clone that disk)...<br />
<br />
ALREADY ATTEMPTED:<br />
All Command Prompts - from SFC to DISM ... it found errors and WAS able to repair or it found errors and NOT able to repair? Really?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnostic Testing: Scans are showing and revealing everything - from Inside Out to Operating System is "good" ... Performed several other types of Diagnostics - all are showing it is functional.</p>
<p>NOTE: All Hardware to Software has been updated and is to the current updated version?<br />
<br />
I did post earlier - as for the Malware to Trojan Issues - when all Software had scanned - none found (Topic appears to be popular) ... and found a fix.&nbsp; This time around scanned the Registry Editor itself:<br />
It's stating in the very old Diagnostic scanner - it's the only ONE showing this:"A KB has been found, please delete or nullify this KB. ERROR: Operating System Mismatch" ... (This is from a long defunct but very reliable diagnostic software - amazingly, was
 generated for Windows 3.x to Win 98! Been extremely helpful in finding the troubled spots ...)</p>
<p>REALLY?&nbsp; It doesn't tell me the KB or where it is located AT or any specifics... so nothing was performed...<br />
All other Diagnostic Scans reveals - Everything is "GOOD"</p>
<p>Animalware Scans - "Found nothing"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CURRENT STATE: Off</strong> - not going to risk anything further / cannot keep having to boot (already ran a Boot Sector Repair - it cannot find any errors?) from DISK just to start it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RUNNING THE NEW WIN 10 PRO ANNIVERSARY DISK - ripped to an DVD for backup...<br />
<br />
Installs and then reverts to "Windows Upgrade failed to install, rolling back changes" - it will only install from the DVD disk / attempts to run "straight up" .. gives an error code of: 0xC000000001&nbsp; (Same to that of the DELL posted above).<br />
<br />
However, booting up from disk is the only way to run this!<br />
<br />
STATUS: HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: All devices, I'm in FLORIDA - I cannot leave anything "On" or "Hibernate" or "Sleep" due to unstable weather and power issues (notorious area for power surges).</p>

            <p>HERE IS THE ANSWERS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FOLKS&nbsp; AND EVERYTHING ELSE APPLIES:</p>
<p>
I found one that will repair it ... manually downloading the KB's and applying the patches...
</p><p>
</p><p>What the WINDOWS UPDATE was doing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>TRYING TO INSTALL A X86 ON A X64 OS!&nbsp; IT SHOULD BE DOWNLOADING A X86 FOR X86/X64 BIT... IT WILL NOT WORK FOR A X64 x X64!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONE SHOULD MANUALLY DOWNLOAD THE PROPER KB ASSIGNED FOR THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SO NOW I CAN REPAIR THIS (Unfortunately, the DELL will have to be completely rebuilt manually - for the OS Main Tower, I have a solution - that will work ... wiping out all the OS's temp files ... will come back to report the result) TOSHIBA:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FOLKS - HERE'S YOUR ANSWER:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device or PC (does not apply to Phone! That download isn't available yet):<br />
<br />
If your mobile or PC runs on (installed 7 / 8 turned to 8.1 / 8.1 / 10: via x86 version...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Runs primarily x86 / Both x86 and x64 .... DOWNLOAD THE X86 MSU PATCH (ES)<br />
<br />
If your mobile or PC runs on (installed 7 / 8 turned to 8.1 / 8.1 / 10: via x64 version</p>
<p>(*note: even if x86 runs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Runs on 64 Bit Only - DOWNLOAD THE X64 MSU PATCH (ES)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also to keep in handy is using the Windows Troubleshooter and/or download the cab file for Windows to start/stop/restore services (VIP! Don't do this manually even if you know how, the Microsoft cab file will correct this issue where SFC / Scannow or DISM
 - including manual mode will NOT!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Try it - it works!<br />
<br />
(Will let Moderators install link for the MSU Patches and the Cab files to this post)</p>
