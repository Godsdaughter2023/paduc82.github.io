<p>Hello Boiantho,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our suggestion for the issue being experienced, attempt all variants of <strong>
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restarting the Console</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the restart is not assisting with clearing this error, attempt a <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Soft Factory Reset</a></strong> while keeping games and
 apps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</span></strong><span>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your
 games or apps. This will save you from downloading or reinstalling the large game files</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This step will remove profiles, so be sure to keep all information for signing into any/all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these and let us know if this information was helpful.</p>

    <title>Double Clicking .xlsx Files Opens a Blank Excel Page. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double Clicking .xlsx Files Opens a Blank Excel Page.</h2>
                    <p>There are a few details that have made diagnosing the issue and solving it difficult. First, this has affected some of the users in our office but not others. Second, we have a global GPO that sets the Excel regkeys DDEAllowed=0, DDECleaned=1, and DontUpdateLinks=1.
 This is due to a security concern relating to DDE-based exploits. For security reasons, we would like these keys to remain as they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to change how .xlsx files are opened when double clicked? I.e. using a protocol other than DDE? Or is there a better way to disable DDE without breaking how Excel files are opened?</p>

 or legacy driver support from MS update. </p>

<p>Not to discourage you from your choice, but that is not quite correct. Apple OS only supports Apple&nbsp;brand computers whereas MS OS supports almost every other PC brand under the sun. With either one you can find yourself&nbsp;owning a computer that cannot be upgraded
 to the latest-greatest version of the operating system.</p>

</p><p>I know this is an old thread, but I came across this and when I read comments like this, it makes my blood boil. Part of me wants to say, go right ahead and hand over 2-3 times the £ to Apple for essentially the same (or inferior) spec (CPU, RAM, gfx etc).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you are expecting to run the latest Windows OS on hardware that is at best 10 years old and then complaining it doesn't work??? And you really think the latest MacOS will run on Apple's own hardware that is 10 years old. Good luck with that. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know someone who had a 3 year old iMac they paid £1200 for a few years back and their shiny new iPod wouldn't sync with it because Apple had deemed the iMac to be obsolete so no more MacOS updates for it. No more MacOS updates means no more iTunes updates.
 No more updates means your £1200 machine is now useless for the things you bought it for. What was that you said about Apple not changing things every few years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try getting some real facts into your head before subjecting innocent bystanders to your immature tantrums. Or better still, put your money where your mouth is and go hand over your hard earnt cash (or do you just sponge off your parents?) to Apple and come
 back here and post how it went for you 10 years later. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to demonstrate how wrong your statement about Apple not changing things every few years is, consider this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Windows machines have used SATA Hard Drive / SSD connectors for a good 14 years now. Whilst we slowly transition to M.2 connectors for SSD's going forward, most machines still comes with one or more SATA connectors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple on the other hand use a propietary SSD connector in their MacBooks. And they've been changing the flipping connector every flipping year!!! e.g.:
<a href="http://greatinfo.com.au/web/images/stories/ebaystore/pcparts/macbookssdmodel6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Apple SSD Connectors">
Apple SSD Connectors</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does that matter you might say? Well consider you can buy a 1TB SATA SSD for your PC/Windows laptop for ~£250. You can even buy a 2TB SSD if you want to. A 1TB SSD for your beloved Apple MacBook will set you back a cool £650. And you can't even buy a
 2TB version for love nor money. So much for "advanced" tech from Apple that doesn't change every few years!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And good luck if your Apple MacBook dies and you need to recover your data off it before trying to get Apple or their resellers to honour what they call the "warranty".

The truth is, techonology is forever marching forward (sometimes backwards!). Innovation and improvement necessitates change. The longevity of any tech is improved when it's flexible and well thought out enough to be able to adapt to newer, faster, improved

<p>You self righteous git, I've had&nbsp;nothing but trouble with Windows ever since Windows '98 (Vista, Windows 8 and 8.1 were total duds) - What time span was that you prat?&nbsp;Nobody&nbsp;I know who uses Apple equipment, has complained about&nbsp;them. A businessman friend
 of mine ditched Windows a couple of years ago and swears by Apple.</p>
<p>I quote "Try getting some real facts into your head before subjecting innocent bystanders to your immature tantrums. Or better still, put your money where your mouth is and go hand over your hard earnt cash (or do you just sponge off your parents?) to Apple
 and come back here and post how it went for you 10 years later"....... </p>
<p>I am 70 years old (so "sponging" off my parents is not an option!) and&nbsp;have been through several Windows versions ('94, XP, Vista et al until the advent of Windows 7 which was brilliant).&nbsp; I resisted Windows 8&nbsp; and 8.1 thankfully which were a nightmare by
 all accounts.</p>
<p>My options come down to buying a new computer and going with Windows 10 or going with Apple and losing all the files I've built up over the years. I am not looking for any advice from you so there's no need for you to offer any..........</p>
<p>..............and by&nbsp;the way,&nbsp;earned is spelt "earned" not "earnt" - you need to brush up on your language skills.</p>

            Hello!<br />
I also own a notebook with this chipset and also received the same response when contacting the manufacturer.<br />
There is only decent drive for Vista, and it is the only usable for the W7. There is a drive for the W7 but, it is very bad and the same drivers do not work from the W8 even in compatibility mode.<br />
Microsoft could release generic drivers highly capable of working with chipsets like this. It is not asking too much, since Microsoft wants users using the W10 because without the drivers the videos are bad to be seen. Here's my tip.<br />
<br />
Note: If there is a problem with words, it is because I used the online translator.

<h3> norcal gunz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo Reach HDD Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have an old account that I downloaded Halo Reach on (from the marketplace) and I originally downloaded it on another Xbox, that isn't at the house I'm in right now, so I re-downloaded it to a new Xbox 360 and went to go play it on my new-er main account
 off of my HDD and it says "Can't launch Halo: Reach." &nbsp;So, I logged off of my main account and logged into the older account that I originally downloaded it on, and I got the same error. &nbsp;Over and over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't use the old account anymore because it is a silver account and I have accomplished alot more on my other account than I ever will on the silver account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me plz?</p>

<p>But only do the license transfer if you're going to continue using this console. You can only do a license transfer once every 4 months. If you're using downloaded content on a different console, it can only be used if the gamertag that originally downloaded
 it is signed into Live.</p>

<h2>            Again, games that worked yesterday are now &#38;quot&#59;Unreadable&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I know I asked this question already, but everyone stopped answering on it. I tried playing NBA 2K11. Keep in mind that this game is very lightly scratched. I tried playing a game in Association Mode. About 2 minutes into the first quarter, it said "This
 Disc Is Unreadable." So I went and cleaned the disc. I started it up, tried to play a game, and again it said "The Disc Is Unreadable". So then I tried playing GTA 4. Another message said "This Disc Is Unreadable." So then I tried Battlefield: Bad Company
 2, which I just bought 3 days ago, and it couldn't even read it. It said "Play DVD" instead of "Play Game" on the dashboard. I tried talking to an Xpert, but he told me to install the game to my HDD and quickly left. When I tried that with NBA 2K11 it said
 that it couldnt do so because the game is "Scratched or Dirty." I took off my HDD and it recognized NBA 2K11 but again said the message when I tried to play a quick game. So I took the disc to a friend's house and it worked on his Xbox.</p>

            <p>Hello TheCuriousMrE,</p>
<p>After reviewing your account, it appears that you are currently being affected by a&nbsp;known&nbsp;database issue which is interfering with the information on your account. What is happening is that your billable account information is being incorrectly communicated to our servers. Since this data is necessary to determine where to place your deposit, the process is aborted.&nbsp;This missing information is also why our system is incorrectly asking you to update your data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this issue is currently being&nbsp;&nbsp;caused by a database not under our control, we have escalated the problem, and it is currently being&nbsp;worked on by another team. At the current point in time, they have not yet provided us with&nbsp;an approximate solution date.&nbsp;Since this error is causing your information to not be received,&nbsp;adjusting your information will not solve this issue. The prompt asking you to check your information is a generic troubleshooter that will not work for this particular situati

            <p>I am not sure this is your solution but it is a good place to start.</p>
<p><span>I would check the status of the Print Spooler Service.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Print Spooler in the list. Check that it has started
 and that the StartUp type is Automatic.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that
 the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not
 checked.</span></p>
<p><span>Now access Windows Explorer and select c:\windows\system32\spool\printers. Normally this folder should be empty but there is a problem when files
 with “spl” and “shd” extensions stick there. Delete the files and restart your computer. This may resolve your immediate problem.</span></p>

<h2>            Why Is Microsoft IGNORING User Complaints&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
<br />
The Forced Update!<br />
<br />
The User Folder Forced name (My games and saves and programs are locked to a certain file path so it is a HUGE problem for me when you don't allow me to choose the name of my own personal folder!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The FAULTY Intel Management Engine Interface MEI Driver v.11. (I can not roll back to v.9.5 which was working perfectly!) so my laptop now can't sleep, hibernate or shutdown normally and I have to Force Shut Down or restart! I would wake up in the night
 to find my laptop is turned on on its own! and the fan blowing hard and hot! the screen is black! and nothing is responsive till I Hard Restart it losing all I was working on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype on both Mobile and Laptop is MESSING UP my contacts renaming some and adding other's info to some none related contacts at all! and you can't stop it or undo it. you will have to revert the changes manually by guessing which number is for which person!!!!
 funny game Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the Support System of Microsoft is soooooooooo&nbsp;BAD! they lock threads even when people are still talking about it without giving us any solution! And their solutions on other threads (like the Hibernate/sleep MEI driver problem) is simply to live with
 it! (and turn off hibernate and sleep features!) THAT IS TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am contacted by someone from Microsoft so I can help provide the information needed to help fix those STUPID BUGS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wishes,</p>
<p>Rami</p>

</p><p>I am a Syrian living in Lebanon.<br />
<br />
I am not allowed to go to the US (because of the Muslim Ban)<br />
<br />
And actually Microsoft (especially Skype) is blocked&nbsp;<strong>by Microsoft</strong> in Syria (it is very very hard to install it in Syria though it is the only secure way to send the news of what is happening out! I messaged Microsoft before so they allow Skype
 in Syria, because the regime was spreading a modded version of Skype and many were arrested and even killed because that modded skype was made so it can spy on them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't afford an over-the-seas call to the US.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
if they want to contact me they can contact me on my email or whatever they want (I can provide info in private)</p>

<p>Because it is the only the world could see what is going on in Syria! Didn't you see all the demonstrations and the killing and bombing? how do you think this was sent out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many other apps are decrypted&nbsp;<strong>illeaglly </strong>by the Regime Controlled ISPs. (they even used programs to&nbsp;do so despite the total rejection of the programmers who invented them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you this,&nbsp;<strong>WHY </strong>to ban Skype in Syria?</p>

<p>Hi Cecilia1984,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens when you press F9 key on the keyboard?<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do other function keys work without any issues?</p>
<p>Here are few steps to disable touchpad while using external mouse.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click the Start button on your computer screen (bottom left corner), then type main.cpl in the search box. When you are finish typing, click Enter on your keyboard.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the new window that opens, click the Device Settings tab at the top. It should be the last one on the right.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; While in the Device Settings section, make sure the name of your touchpad is highlighted (it should be already), then click the Disable button. Click OK, and then click OK again when the warning box pops up.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Photo Gallery 2012 is excruciatingly slow&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last 6 months or so I am finding WLPG very slow.&nbsp; It takes ages to edit photos and then save them.&nbsp; I recently upgraded to 2012 but to no avail.&nbsp; I have run the Fixit solution countless times where is regenerates the database but still no improvement.&nbsp;
 I also looked at other discussions regarding Colour Management which I really don't understand so this is what it looks like.&nbsp; Can someone please help me using layman's terms?</p>
<p>I have an HP TouchSmart 310 PC 4 bit operating system.</p>
<p>Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>

            Could you provide some additional information, please. Are other programs also running slow these past six months? How much space do you have free on your hard disk? What specific tasks take a long time, cropping, adjusting exposure? How long does it take
 after you click Close File before the thumbnails are up and available again, can you give an estimate in seconds? Is Windows up-to-date? Which version are you running? What happened six months ago when the machine became slow? Did you add any software, hardware?

            <p>Hello Ludwig, thanks for your reply, so many questions.&nbsp; I will try to reply in order.</p>
<p>Yes my Windows Live Email also runs slow, I get frequent (not responding) on both WLE and WLP.</p>
<p>My startup is also now slower and also when loading IE11 it is slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be less that 6 months but there was a Windows Update and my display went wrong.&nbsp; It would only display Windows Classic, it would not allow me to change it to Windows 7.&nbsp; I think I must have done something to the colour management which eventually
 changed the display to Windows 7.&nbsp; I had also run the MS Fixit for Windows Aero Glass but to no avail.&nbsp; I have 1TB space and free 669.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Advanced SystemCare <span>8</span>&nbsp; by &nbsp;IObit to check my pc.&nbsp; It is good but has slowed my startup since then.&nbsp; I have disabled it so that it starts when I want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows is all up to date. I am running Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I load Windows Live Photogallery&nbsp; it takes about 13-14 seconds to load up with all my photos. I click on a photo and it seems to take about 20 secs to open. If I do and auto change it takes about 8-10 secs and then when I move to the next one it takes
 about 20 secs to save.&nbsp; The next photo takes about 10-12 secs to save. However this varies, sometimes it is quicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope I have answered your questions.</p>

            <p>Thank you, SprakleMarlow, for the detailed information.&nbsp; I have tried to replicate a comparable PC and starting&nbsp;Photo Gallery and&nbsp;loading a large JPG photo (22 MB) takes about 2 seconds, saving after edit takes about 5 seconds. On my own PC saving is about
 2 seconds. Those are probably the times you experienced half a year ago. I believe the slow Photo Gallery performance is just a symptom of other problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Windows Task Manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC), with Photo Gallery running the CPU usage should be less than 10% or so, with fewer than 50 processes running. If you see high CPU usage and a large number of processes running, see what is going on. You may find
 that some of the IOBit tools are still running. Do you have more than one anti-virus program running?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned difficulties with the Personalization settings. See if your&nbsp;display adapter&nbsp;drivers are up-to-date. Windows does not update those drivers automatically (Control Panel - Device Manger - Display Adapters).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Over time files become fragmented and take longer to</p>

<h3> jim carrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safe Mode Loop</h2>
                    <p>My Refurbished Dell Latitude D600 has an issue, where the computer goes to a black screen, and tells me to enter Safe Mode, Start Windows normally, etc. &nbsp;I tried every option, but the computer only started loading, and then it went back to the same screen.
 &nbsp;I used F8 during loading to get to the blue "Technical Information" &nbsp;screen, by reading information I learned from another FAQ on this site. &nbsp;I have information from the "*** STOP" line. &nbsp;It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** STOP: &nbsp;0x000000ED (0x8A91A628, 0xC000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can tell me what this means, and how to fix it, that would be great. &nbsp;Thanks in advance! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Good job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that error, you need to run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) and you can create yourself a Hiren's Boot CD, boot on that and run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r from there.&nbsp; You may need to run the chkdsk with error correction more than once.&nbsp; If your system
 has the factory installed 30GB HDD it should not take too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Borrowing an XP CD might work, but in the real world, it is unlikely that anybody is going to have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP3 on it...&nbsp; you usually have to make those yourself using a&nbsp; SP1 or SP2 CD as a starting point, but you may bet
 lucky.&nbsp; To get into the Recovery Console to run a chkdsk /r you can use any genuine bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find one and if you can get you into the XP Recovery Console, you can run the chkdsk with error correction from there - provided it works and provided you can get past the Administrator prompt and provided your system does not have a SATA HDD
 drive (I don't think so from looking at it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All those mights and maybes are not a problem with a Hiren's Boot CD so if I were you I would make one and then you will have something that should always work and not have to do any borrowing.&nbsp; Hiren's doesn't care if your system has SATA drives and doesn't
 care about your XP Administrator password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another advantage of Hiren's over the XP Recovery Console is that you will be able to access your HDD and copy any files off to an external USB drive if you are interested in that.&nbsp; Not possible with the XP RC and it's limited maneuverability - unless you
 adjusted the Registry prior to the incident to make it possible.&nbsp; The only people&nbsp; know of that make those adjustments are me and me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you will need a working system that is capable of burning a CD to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get done, you will have a very useful bootable CD (lots of good things on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<p><br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dnvcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE problem</h2>
                    <p>Upgrading 10 onto window 7.</p>
<p>During the course of the upgrade, when the installation has reached 32% there is a terrible screeching sound from the speakers and the installation stops. No effort to reduce the volume helps and I am compelled to switch off the laptop then.</p>
<p>I have made two attempts and the same failure at the same stage. At this stage the files and drivers are getting uploaded.</p>
<p>When I switch on again automatically my previous version is restored.</p>
<p>Will appreciate some help on this.</p>

            <p>Well in the third attempt the upgrade did go through.</p>
<p>But my MS office is not fully compatible with this OS .</p>
<p>My XL files refuse to open from the location they are in.</p>
<p>My MS Office Home &amp; Student version 2013 is in the Program folder but does not show the sub folders Word/Excel/Powerpoint.</p>
<p>The task bar similarly does not show them even if I open some Word and XL files.</p>
<p>To open my XL files I have to somehow open any one of them and then from there I need to open any other file that I need.</p>
<p>All the XL files on my desktop or in my mails do not open directly...with a message " There was a problem sending the command to the program ".</p>
<p>I have sought help from the Microsoft Service Team and they are supposed to call me in a day or two. At the moment they are very busy attending customers with other issues.</p>
<p>This is the status so far.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                    have tried to connect several times following the on line instructions. Could a firewall be stopping connection? If so how do I find correct path address to overcome this. Could there be some other settings I am missing? cheers, IanC

            this might seem strange and/or simple, but is there anything sitting on top of your printer? I struggled for hours to get it to communicate through wifi, as soon as I took a small box off of my printer, it registered with my computer. So, now I don't keep
 anything sitting on top of my printer (on the scanner part). I have the same series as you, so I hope this helps.

            <p>Thanks Lynette for your interest, as this is my secondary printer I returned it to the supplier received my money back when to another supplier bought a similar model Canon MG 3560 and found I had the same Wi Fi problems connecting. No there is nothing on
 top of the printer but my household has several remote devices and maybe there is other interference. In the end I settled for the extra expense of buying a USB cable and when I need to use colour I now simply connect it; cheers, Ian</p>

            Hi there Jeff, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />It sounds like there may be an issue with your system files or the app files. Try these steps:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />DISM:

<br />
<br />Otherwise, I would uninstall and reinstall the app. This should be what fixes it if the above doesn't.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Oh no, ok, we can work with this. Did you buy your<br />Machine new with windows 10 on it? If so, there should be a digital license assigned to the hardware and windows will activate when reinstalled. <br /><br />And when you say “crashed” - the computer won’t turn on at all? Windows won’t boot into the OS? Let me know and we’ll move forward!<br />- C

            You mean you lost your recovery partition, right?<br /><br />That’s ok... do you think you could use another pc to follow these next steps. <br /><br />If you go here -   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a> - you can create a windows 10 bootable usb. That’ll allow you to install it on your crashed machine, and windows should activate if windows 10 was activated on there before. <br /><br />I think this is your best play, Let me know!<br />- C

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; WD Book- Drive E.</h2>
                    <p>I have connected my WD Book to Drive E. On my Acer Laptop/Tablet.&nbsp; I downloaded a game.&nbsp; I have set up a folder in the Book as Games.</p>
<p>Windows 10 recognizes the Drive E.&nbsp; I do not have enough Memory on my C. drive as Windows 10 has taken up most of my memory.</p>
<p>When I went in to play the game on E.&nbsp; it was not there, and it had said that download was finished.&nbsp; The game was not on my Windows 10 either.</p>
<p>How do set up Windows to download to a file on my WD Book?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you please advise me.</p>
<p>
