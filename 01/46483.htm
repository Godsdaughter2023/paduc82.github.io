<h2>            Does having Minimum Processor State set at 100&#37; cause problems&#63;</h2>
                    This is the default setting for the High Performance plan in Windows 7. What sort of problems, if any, can this cause? Or is it simply a matter of using a lot of energy?

            <p>The proceesor will consume more energy and generate more heat when at idle since the idle clock speed (in GHz) would be the same speed as the rated clock speed for your CPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For laptops this could have a noticable impact on how long the laptop can run before battry power is depleted.</p>

            There should be no problem reading files on a USB key formatted FAT32 (the common format for USB keys) whether the files came from another computer or not. I move my USB key from my Macs to my Windows machines to my clients' machines with no problem. The
 exception would be if you *encrypted* the files. Presumably you would know if you did that. Check and see if the files are visible if you plug the drive into another computer. If they are, you might want to copy them to that computer and format the USB key
 (FAT32 is fine) and copy the files back. Or, if the key is getting elderly, this might be a sign it is going to fail soon. They do fail.

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t access old GFWL account, any way to move keys to new account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After not using my Games for Windows Live account for about a year, I have finally purchased a game through Steam that requires a log in to that service, and I am unable to remember the correct information to re-enter my old account that I had linked to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">four</span> different games. Within the year of not using the service I have reformatted my computer and any saved information associated to the account was lost for it does not remember the log in information. I know
 what the end gamertag is but not the associated e-mail or password, and the limited scope of combinations I could have used back then have not worked.</p>
<p>Is there any way to be able to move my keys, that I can still access from the Steam library, onto my new account? I don't care about the save files since I could go back through and beat them again, but being able to play them after having already bought
 them/had them gifted is what I need most. Or is there any way to contact someone that could help resolve this issue?</p>

I'm afraid there is a strong chance you might not be able to regain access without the WLID and password but your best bet is to schedule a call with phone support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>)
 as they'll be able to take a closer look at your account!</p>

<p>Would having all 4 keys that are linked with the account even be enough? Those I can still access, maybe if I had put my name in it too that could help it, but there's no point in any of that if they're only going to ask for account specific 'what email
 is associated with it? what was the password?' for obvious reasons. And is there anyway to do all that through e-mail?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 audio sound level is very quiet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 audio sound level is very quiet</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home. Most things work fine, except the sound level is very soft. I have all sounds levels at maximum volume, including the speakers themselves, and I can still barely hear anything. Audio worked
 fine in Windows Vista and Windows 7. I have installed the latest Windows 10 drivers for my motherboard which uses RealTek. Still having the issue. DxDiag seems to indicate everything is fine. The audio green bar graph in the sound section lights up when sound
 is being played. The headphone jack works, but the sound quality is not great. It does produce higher sound levels if I plug the speakers into it.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have finally resolved it after the suggestions here and finding other tidbits elsewhere. There are a few steps to take, so I will outline them below. It is not an ideal solution because the issue is with the Realtek drivers, which don't work in Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable Automatic Update of Drivers</strong></p>
<p>Windows, by default, will automatically update your drivers to the latest version, which is why some of you are seeing it overwrite your temporary fix. To turn this behavior off, do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hit the windows key on your keyboard</p>
<p>2. Type in "System" and select the one with "Control Panel" under the name.</p>
<p>3. Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left side of the screen</p>
<p>4. Click on the "Hardware" tab</p>
<p>5. Click on "Device Installation Settings"</p>
<p>6. Put your settings like the image below</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ac56b37-b6be-4a68-b3be-14319c6b5eb2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Uninstall Realtek Device</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hit the windows key on the keyboard</p>
<p>2. Type in "Device Manager" and launch it</p>
<p>3. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers</p>
<p>4. Right-click on the Realtek device and select "Uninstall"</p>
<p>5. Check the box to uninstall the device driver as well</p>
<p>6. Run the uninstall</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Find Device</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Staying in Device Manager, you should see that the Realtek device has been removed. Do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on "Action" at the top.</p>
<p>2. Select "Scan for hardware changes"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will find your audio device and then install the generic "High Definition Audio Device". This may take a few minutes. Once it is done, your sound will work properly and it won't be updated by Windows on a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The above method will work, but you can never update the driver or you will break it again. Until Realtek gets their drivers working properly, you will also have to keep Windows from auto-updating as well. Not a perfect solution, but it works.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Check the ip address of the computer. See if you are getting the IP from the DHCP Server/modem wireless&nbsp;( if is configured for automatic ) or if your are getting an APIPA address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Windows-based computer that is configured to use DHCP can automatically assign itself an Internet Protocol (IP) address if a DHCP server is not available.</p>
<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved 169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255 for Automatic Private IP Addressing. As a result, APIPA provides an address that is guaranteed not to conflict with routable addresses.</p>
<p>After the network adapter has been assigned an IP address, the computer can use TCP/IP to communicate with any other computer that is connected to the same LAN and that is also configured for APIPA or has the IP address manually set to the 169.254.x.y (where
 x.y is the client’s unique identifier) address range with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. Note that the computer cannot communicate with computers on other subnets, or with computers that do not use automatic private IP addressing. Automatic private IP addressing
 is enabled by default.</p>

<h3> jcmcfadden  say:</h3>
<h2>            RAM for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I will be buying a new laptop, with Win 8, and upgrading to Win 8.1.<br />
Most laptops (in my price range) seem to come with 6GB.<br />
Will Windows suffer with only 6GB of RAM?<br />
Are there advantages to having 8GB instead of 6GB?<br />
What about next generations of Windows?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I run Windows 8.1 64 bit with no problem on my laptop with 4GB. You may need more RAM for the programs you run, but Win 8.1 itself will work just fine in 6.<br />
<br />
So the next question is, what do you need to run? Office, games, AutoCAD? That's as important to think about as Windows itself. For most uses, 6 will probably do just fine, but if you're a power user you'll probably want more. I can run Office, play HD video
 and play Minecraft with no problem on 4 GB laptop, but it can't handle seriously complex stuff like virtual machines. (I do that stuff on my big tower system.)<br />

            If you are going to be using Windows 8 PRO&nbsp;64 bit&nbsp;I would recommend more (8 or 12) but if running Windows 8 32 bit&nbsp;6 will be fine. And even Windows 8 PRO 64 bit will run on as little as 4.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we
 will be glad to assist you.

<h2>            System hangs at welcome screen after logging in- will boot into safe mode</h2>
                    <p><span><u><em>Original Title</em></u>:<strong>Cannot get past welcome screen, no W7 DVD, possible registry errors</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Okay, so I've been searching for quite a while and people have had the same problem as I have, except that in my case, I CAN access safe mode, and I had problems before this that led up to this moment. So if anyone can help me, please let me know.
 Keep in mind these few things though:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. I absolutely&nbsp;<b><u>cannot</u></b>&nbsp;afford to clean install, as I have very important files on here, no external HDD to put them on, etc<br />
<br />
2. I am extremely broke, so I cannot buy anything including burnable DVDs to boot from, etc, plus, I upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 long ago, so I never even got a DVD. Plus, my DVD burner doesn't work very well.<br />
<br />
3. I tried system restore, only to find that it "failed". It said that it couldn't restore anything as registry is either damaged or "missing".<br />
<br />
<br />
So I have to find a way to fix my computer here and now or I'm pretty much stuck with safe mode.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsad.gif" /><br />
<br />
<br />
So, here's how it all began...<br />
<br />
My computer was running completely fine until 2 days ago, when I started having icons missing from my desktop, my computer ran INCREDIBLY slow, and apparently, my second hard drive (that I keep a few programs and games on), was missing from the list. I then
 ran in safe mode to see what was up with this, and I found my second HDD. It told me that it needed to be formatted...well, that's weird because I already had that thing formatted long ago into NTFS. So for whatever reason, it decided to not work. I tried
 system restore as well, and it ended up saying it couldn't do it because the registry was damaged or missing. The next thing I was told to do was unplug it and reboot, so I did, my computer ran okay, booted up fine, etc. I tried plugging it back in again (and
 yes, I turned off my computer and stuff), and it showed up again, with all my files, games, music, etc. The next day it ran perfectly fine...until today. Today, I was on here, and I go to browse my other HDD and come to find, it's missing again. So I unplugged
 it and plugged it back in again thinking it might just be a crappy SATA cable or something, but as soon as I got to the welcome screen, I typed in my password, hit enter, and got stuck at the "welcome" screen. The little blue circle thing just kept spinning,
 and I let it sit there for a good 10 minutes or so, only to find it wasn't actually doing anything.<br />
I restarted a few times to try and log in...but the same thing kept happening. I even unplugged my other HDD again and tried logging in...same outcome.<br />
The next thing I did was load up and press "F8". I tried running system recovery mode, and tried system restore. I loaded up from about a week ago and let it do it's thing. About 10 minutes later, it came back to me saying that system restore had failed and
 that the registry was damaged or missing. Same problem I had the day before. I ran the startup diagnostic, said the OS booted fine (which clearly it doesn't), I ran a memory diagnostic, said I had no problems there, I ran a HDD diagnostic, said my hard drives
 were fine, and I ran my Virus scanner, CCleaner, and Defragger and had no problems. So why can't I get past the screen? Why is my other hard drive acting up?<br />
What's going on?<br />
<br />
I ended up searching online with my phone and found some people having this same problem. I saw suggestions to boot from their Windows 7 DVD and try a system recovery, I saw suggestions to do a full on clean install, and I saw one to do this weird "reinstall"
 thing that doesn't remove programs...but you needed your Windows 7 DVD.&nbsp;<br />
I had a chat with my friend who's way advanced with this stuff and he said I probably have a major registry error preventing me from getting past the Welcome Screen when I boot regularly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, as stated before, I do not have a Windows 7 DVD. I upgraded from Vista a long long time ago when 7 came out. I honestly do not have the spare cash at the moment to go pick up a burnable DVD pack, my DVD drive barely burns anything as is, and I do not
 have a way of backing up my files whatsoever. I'm sure there's always a way to fix these things, so I'm wondering if there's anything I can do at this moment to fix it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please, if anyone has any idea of what I should do, without using a DVD, doing a clean install, or buying anything, please let me know! I use my computer not only as a personal thing, but it's used for work, recordings, band stuff, etc.&nbsp;</span>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Since you are able to boot in safe mode this issue could be caused by some third party application, you may try the clean boot troubleshooting to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program
 manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Note:</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>

            The redirect to 'How to use Safe mode' helped me resolve almost the same problem!<br />
<br />
<div>Through the process of elimination described there, I figured out that it was my antivirus software that had become screwed-up. Before that I'd tried restarting in all available modes, removing the MoBo battery - but was essentially fumbling in the dark.
 I'd always get a long "welcome" screen, followed by a perpetual black screen with only the white mouse cursor&nbsp;viable. Could have sworn it was a video driver issue, but, thank you so much for this help!</div>

            <p>Hi Stanley_99,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question. It looks like you are not able to boot to the normal mode after the updates were installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check what were the updates installed. Use this link to check the steps:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the safe boot option is checked under msconfig:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the search box and hit enter.</p>
<p>b. Click the <strong>boot tab</strong> and verify that the <strong>safe boot option</strong> is
<strong>not checked.</strong></p>

            RE:Method 2 above, I have tried to perform a system restore from Windows Recovery with no success. I have tried more than one recovery point. &nbsp;Windows acts as if it is starting, but shows the windows logo for 30+ minutes with no success. &nbsp; I am still having
 the original issue. &nbsp;Please provide additional options to resolve.&nbsp;

<h2>            Blue screen error 0x00009086</h2>
                    When I boot my system, everything seems fine but after a while the system stops and I get a blue screen saying 0x00009086 error occured. Then it restarts the system and afterwards everything works fine and the screen does not appear anymore. But if I boot
 it again the next time, the same happens. I'm using Windows 8 and not an IT expert so I would appreciate if you could help me out. Thanks in advance!

<p><span><span>Hi ritalive,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>What exactly happens when you are trying to establish the connection from the desktop to the laptop?</span></span></p>
<p><span>First, enable the “File and Printer sharing” on both the Laptop and the Desktop machine.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
</span><strong><span>To turn on file and printer sharing</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Advanced sharing settings by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, click Network and Sharing Center, and then,
 in the left pane, click Change advanced sharing settings. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the chevron to expand the current network profile.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If printer sharing is off, under File and printer sharing, select Turn on file and printer sharing, and then click Save changes.<span>
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong>
</span></span><strong><span>To share your printer</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Devices and Printers by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then, on the Start menu, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Devices and Printers</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the printer you want to share, and then click
<span>Printer properties</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span>Sharing</span> tab, and select the <span>Share this printer</span> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>Other people on your network can now connect to this printer. All they need to do is add a network printer (your printer) to their
 computers.</span></p>
<span>Method 3: To add a network printer</span>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Devices and Printers by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then, on the Start menu, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Devices and Printers</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>Add a printer</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>Add a network, wireless, or Bluetooth printer</span>, click the shared printer, click
<span>Next</span>, and follow the instructions on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are connected to a Homegroup, follow this method.</span></p>
<span>Method 4: To manually connect to a homegroup printer</span>
<p><span>If you don't see "<span>Windows</span> found a homegroup printer," you can still connect manually by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the computer that the printer is physically connected to, click the
<span>Start</span> button, click <span>Control Panel</span>, type <span><span>homegroup</span></span> in the search box, and then click
<span>HomeGroup</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure the
<span>Printers</span> check box is selected.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the computer you want to print from.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open HomeGroup by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><span>, typing
</span></span><span><span>homegroup</span></span><span><span> in the search box, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>HomeGroup</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>Install printer</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you don't already have a driver installed for the printer, click
<span>Install driver</span> in the dialog box that appears.</span></p>

    <title>Virus broke Windows Defender &#38; Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Virus broke Windows Defender &#38; Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have been struck by a pretty nasty Trojan. It was able to remove all 3rd party anti-viruses which I had installed (Bitdefender &amp; Malwarebytes) and it broke Windows Defender and Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-installing Malwarebytes it found a Trojan.BitCoinMiner and it succesfully removed it, however, my Windows Defender and Windows Updates are still not working. This is how Windows Defender looks like for me:</p>
<p>http://prntscr.com/lfcx5a</p>
<p>http://prntscr.com/lfcx8g</p>
<p>http://prntscr.com/lfcxcz</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might think that this is how Windows Defender looks normally, but no, you can check by opening Windows Defender for yourself. Besides it looking like this, none of the buttons do anything, e.g. ''Scan now'' won't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides Windows Defender being broken, I also can no longer install updates, I will get an error message displayed. Here yet another picture:</p>
<p>http://prntscr.com/lfcxil</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in case it might help, this is what Malwarebytes found:</p>
<p>http://prntscr.com/lfcxm8</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had also installed other anti-viruses, such as Bitdefender, Kaspersky and Avast, and they all found nothing after Malwarebytes took action. I have tried searching for solutions but until now I haven't had any luck. Apparently it's impossible to ''re-download/install''
 Windows Defender, which is a shame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that re-installing Windows will solve the issue, but I really don't want to. I am a student and I need this laptop desperately every day, especially now since I have finals. Besides, I don't want to go through the hassle of re-installing all the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will I be able to ''recover'' Windows without losing all files &amp; drivers? Honestly all what needs to be fixed is Windows Defender &amp; Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to receive some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leandro V.</p>

            You need not uninstall and reinstall Windows. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            Windows 10 system image recovery can&#39;t find system image</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to restore my laptop using a system image that I made on my external hard disk but system image recovery can't find system image. The same system image could be found when i restored my windows earlier on but after resetting windows
 10 using the options in the settings, system image recovery couldn't find the system image stored in my hard disk. When I boot into windows and attach my hard disk to my laptop, the files were all there. What should I do to make system image recovery find
 my system image? &nbsp;</p>

            The only way to know if system image is corrupted or broken is by trying to do a system restore. You may want to contact your manufacturer so that they can provide you a
<strong>Recovery Media</strong>.

    <title>serious problem &#58; chinese typing suggestion is gone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            serious problem &#58; chinese typing suggestion is gone</h2>
                    <p>Windows used to have very robust and nice Chinese Input system, which comes with&nbsp;a very useful list of word suggestions, which shows the words that you may choose after typing/writing one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since Win 8, it's gone all together, making Chinese typing feel like stone age!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well to be a little fair, there is auto correct and a list of "suggestions of the next word"&nbsp;located on the top of the Virtual writing pad, however:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>the auto correct, for 99% of times, turns the words before the last one into something wrong, and in fact, turns them into&nbsp;a combination that don't make sense at all.</li><li>The list "suggestions of the next words", now only show a very few suggestions, appears only on the virtual writing pad, is crammed in the very few suggestions, and worst, is mixed with the suggestions of the replacements of the current word... so, sometimes
 the suggestions of the next word wont get shown at all, even if we click on the downward arrow that sometimes appear on the right of the list, that is too much to do as we will have to click it after we type every single word, whiles the list is, too, contains
 too little suggestions and most of them&nbsp;don't &nbsp;make sense.</li></ol>
<p>It is understandable that MS want to make Windows very robust in the touch era, but completely removing some of the most basic features that are already great, without a logical replacement is rendering it useless in the long run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users RELY ON CHNESE WRITING EVERY MINUTE WILL DEFINITELY KEEP AWAY FROM 8/8.1 BECAUSE OF THIS, PLEASE DONT UNDERSTIMATE THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BY THE WAY, I DONT TYPE IN CAPITAL INTENTIONALY, ITS THE BUG OF 8.1, ALTHOUGH NOT ALWASY HAPPEN, MAKE ME TYPE IN CAPTAL EVEN THE SHIFT BUTTON ON THE VIRTUAL KEYBOARD ISNT LITGHTN UP AT ALL.</p>

            <p>Hi Babu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your attention, please have the pic below for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the part "Next Word Suggestion", it happends to any program, however, please let me clearify that, "Next Word Suggestion"&nbsp;does present during the use of virtual keyboard, but missing during the use of physical keyboard &nbsp;(As shown in the pic below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Cap lock problem, it too seems to be system; although I mainly recall&nbsp;the it happened&nbsp;during&nbsp; the use of&nbsp;Words (2013) and IE (as happened when I composed the question).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it happened&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;was composing the question, closing the virtual keypad and then&nbsp;reopening it didn't fix it, but closing IE did. Also, as this issue is super random, I can't really reproduce it at will (although&nbsp;it "seems"&nbsp;to be&nbsp;related to the speed
 we click the virtual buttons)</p>

<p>Try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verify the desired position is available:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the wired headset from the console. </li><li>On the wireless headset, press the connect button. Lights on the wireless headset and on the controller are lit when they are connected.

</li><li><strong>Make sure the headset works:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect all other accessories from the Xbox 360 console, including any wired Xbox 360 controllers.
</li><li>Turn off all Xbox 360 Wireless Controllers:
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <b>Guide</b> button on the controller for three seconds.<br />
<br />

</li><li>Confirm that you want to turn off only the controller. </li></ol>
</li><li>Press the power button on the wireless headset. </li><li>Press the connect button on the console.
<ul>
<li>On the original Xbox 360 console, the connect button is on the front between the Memory Unit ports and the power button.<br />

</li></ul>
</li><li>Press the connect button on the wireless headset. The lights around the power button on the console will spin and blink once. The position that remains lit is the position of the wireless headset.
</li><li>
<p>If you want to test if the wireless headset will connect to the other positions, press the connect button again. The wireless headset will connect to the next position.</p>
<p>If your wireless headset cannot connect to the console, the wireless headset might be defective. You can order a replacement headset from the

Xbox Online Service Centre</a>. Product registration may be required.</p>
</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>Test the controllers:</strong>
<p>If a wireless headset can connect to the console when no controllers are connected to the console, there is a problem with one of the controllers. To identify which controller is causing the problem, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are using a wireless controller, press the <b>Guide</b> button to turn on the controller. If you are using a wired controller, connect the controller to the first position on the console.
</li><li>Press the connect button on the controller.<br />
<br />

<br />
</li><li>On the wireless headset, press the connect button until the lit section on the controller Guide button matches the lit number on the wireless headset. If this is successful, go to the next step. If it is not, the controller might be defective. Try another
 controller. </li><li>Connect a second controller to the second position on the console. Leave the first controller connected to the first position on the console.
</li><li>On the wireless headset, press the connect button until the lit number on the wireless headset matches the lit position on the second controller Guide button.
</li></ol>
<p>If this procedure is successful, repeat these steps for each additional controller. You can connect up to four controllers.</p>
<p>If you determine that a controller is defective, you can order a replacement controller from the

<p>It usually does not connect to a controller when you have had a wired headset connected to the bottom of the controller or a chat pad, what happens is the little hole that the jack goes in becomes a little blocked. You need a tooth pick to clean it out and
 open it back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have done that the wireless headset should sync to that controller again.</p>

<p>Are you using a chatpad on said controller if so try removing it</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The other thing is to keep pressing the connect button on the wireless headset as it cycles through the the controller numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a spare controller sync that one to number one then see if the wireless headset connects, if it does then connect your first controler to number 2 and see if the wireless headset will move to 2 also with the connect button.</p>

            <p>Another idea would be to try performing a hard reset EXACTLY&nbsp;like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, as whiteandshiny says it could very well be a hardware issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
