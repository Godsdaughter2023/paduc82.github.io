<h2>            Microsoft Action Pack to retail license</h2>
                    Hi, I have a 2012 R2 server that's being used for a client in a terminal server test environment, it's just running from an action pack license and they would now like to use it in real world production.<br />
<br />
If I buy them a &nbsp;server 2012 R2 retail license can I change the product keys and have this all officially licensed or will I need to reload the server from scratch with the new key to avoid being penalized from Microsoft if there's ever an audit?

<h2>            Cannot access any Yahoo or Google sites in any browser in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have Malwarebytes Premium and Kaspersky Internet Security installed on my laptop, running Windows 10. There have been no Windows updates in the past few days. Malwarebytes was upgraded to a new version a couple of days ago. When I turned on my computer
 this evening, MB ran its daily scan and found no issues. Then Kaspsersky requested a reboot to update some components. After the reboot, I attempted to access Google, Yahoo Mail, and Gmail in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Those websites would not work in any
 browser. They do not redirect, but simply time out. Thinking it was related to the Kaspersky update, I first disabled Kaspersky and then uninstalled it. No luck. I subsequently reinstalled Kaspersky. No change. Then I installed
<span>SuperAntiSpyware </span>and ran a scan. It found cookies, but nothing else. No change. What else can I try?<br />

<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>Your console is likely still in the preview program, so you're now receiving the preview updates for the next system update that will be released to the public soon. &nbsp;If you'd like to stop getting the preview updates, you'll need to unenroll your console
 through the Preview Dashboard app - the unenrollment will take effect once this update being tested is released to the public... you'll only receive the monthly public updates after that.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m being DDosed.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm getting very angry over the fact I'm being IP Flooded or DDOSED I don't know it's one of them or UDP Flooded by a person. The boy who is doing it has bad issues with some type of ADHD Or something he just loses it. I was friends with someone he didn't
 like over xbox and so he removed me, threatented me with the DDOS Attack and said he's got a group of 3 people to flood me. He sent me the names of the 3 people in a message. This is going to far.. I joined to play halo and I can't do this. I'm sick of him
 hitting me his gamer tag is Nuclear x Fire. Alot of party talk has taken place about Ddosing. I've reported and reported and reported. I've had friends heard him talking and reported him. I'm sick of this service and I demand his account is to be investigated
 or whatever you guys do.. I'm close to trying to find someone who is smart to hit him offline, I know this isn't the right thing to do but what else will I do? That's why I'm posting this. I'm sure I'm not the only one but I'm fed up. He also got my MAIN account
 perm banned. This account was never suspended or banned in the past. But I admit. My friend recovered the account and modded my avatars hair to green he said it was fine but I always thought it was a bit over the line. And it's been perm banned along with
 12 mounths. Nuclear x Fire got me spam reported by his friends. I'm sick of this. I was to be helped.</p>

<p>You or your parents agreed to a permaban being punishment for that offence when you signed up to XBL. You can't back out of an agreement like that once you've agreed to it.

<h2>            cursor keeps popping down a line instead of staying where I move it</h2>
                    <p>About 3 months ago a cursor problem began and I am not aware that I changed anything to make it happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I drag the cursor to the line I want, it frequently pops down to the line below when I lift my finger (I have a laptop and use the mousepad to navigate).&nbsp; So when I immediately click or double click it opens the line below, not the one I want. &nbsp; At
 first I thought it was a yahoo mail problem -- I try to open an email, but it pops down to the one below and opens that instead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However yesterday it kept doing it in <strong>Excel </strong>and altering the cell below the one I dragged the cursor to and messing up the wrong line. &nbsp; So now I suspect it is my laptop, not yahoo that is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it never did this before 3 months ago, and it doesn't do it on everything......&nbsp; did I accidentally turn on some crazy feature to make this happen?&nbsp; I really want to fix this -- thanks.</p>

            Hi Carol,<br />
<br />
<br />
To isolate the issue with your cursor, may we know what troubleshooting steps have you done so far? Have you tried using a different mouse and see if you're still getting the same problem? Have you tried updating you're drivers?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

                    <p>hi</p>
<p>I have an old machine that has been given to my daughter for her birthday, its running win7 which has the basic parental controls but I want to be able to get detailed activity reports like I do on my windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>I have set up an administrator account and added her as a standard user but cannot find the additional software required.</p>
<p>having had a search around all I seem to keep finding is windows live family safety but its seems like its been discontinued or no longer works as I cant seem to get a download.</p>
<p>if I could somehow link her user account on the win7 laptop to her Microsoft id account on my win 10 machine would it collect reports from the older machine also? or not as its win 10?</p>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Parental Control feature of Windows 7 and the Family feature differs in many ways. Unlike the Family feature in Windows 10, there are limitation with the previous features of the previous Windows version. The &nbsp;web filtering and activity reporting are
 not available on the Parental Control Feature in Windows 7. What we recommend is that you set up family features. Kindly check the article below for more information.</p>

Not all games will work with the controller and some may need special settings triggered in the game to allow them to work.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A corrupted game installation file or update may cause Forza Horizon 3 not to launch on your PC. To properly isolate your concern, please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can <span>
run the troubleshooter for Windows Apps on your computer by clicking the <strong>
Run troubleshooter</strong> button on this </span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a></span><span>.

<p>I have the same problem, my game doesn't start anymore :-( (by the way I never had problems downloading it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It started happening after the Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I downloaded it from the Windows Store.</p>

<p>4. No, it is the only game that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the&nbsp;<span>troubleshooter for Windows Apps but the game is still not starting, it closes after the splash screen and the very first screen with the disclaimer :-(</span></p>

            I started having this issue a few days ago as well. Where you would have been playing forza 7 or something then when you try to start it a day or 2 later it crashes to the desktop after the splash screen. Seems this has been going on for some people for
 a year or more. If you install a small app from the windows store like Netflix or sling, the games (forza 7 and forza horizon 3) will start. In a couple of days, you will have to do it again. I read it had something to do with authenticating, but that may
 be wrong. I know this needs to be fixed because I won't buy another MS game or other app from the MS Store until this is resolved.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I just wait that the FH developers are fixing the problem (https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postsm869890_-ANSWERED--Forza-Horizon-3-closes-on-startup----again-after-fixing-it.aspx#post_869890) or MS fixes it with the next Creators Update. Let's
 see :-)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update, can&#39;t do anything.</h2>
                    I did the latest update last night, Dec 14th, and when I turned on my computer today I couldn't do anything. I signed in, I'm in my desktop screen and it looks normal. But nothing will run without loading forever, can't open task manager or open start
 menu. And eventually it tells me my entire desktop isn't responding then goes to a black screen with a cursor.&nbsp;

<h3> minh tran-le  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows8.1 explorer.exe memory leak when used with &#39;sort by date&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Just checking if this happen to other people.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8.1 (9600) and I have a few folders that have a lots of files (600 ~ 2000)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the file explorer on those directory with <strong>View-&gt;List</strong> and
<strong>Sorted</strong> <strong>By-&gt;Date</strong></p>
<p>As you keep adding or removing new sub-folders and files to that main folder, explorer will refresh to display the new file order.</p>
<p>Explorer is pretty fast at first doing the refresh but then it become slower and slower and take up to 10GB until I either kill the explorer.exe task or logout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use 'Sorted By Name' then it does not have any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody knows if it is a known problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sounds like you&nbsp;need to make smaller folders if aligning by date is important to you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Eventually if you are adding folders within folders eventually you will reach the maximum number of characters in a path length&nbsp;and cause that too, if you haven't already done so.&nbsp; You will suddenly not be able to delete or move files as the name is too
 long for windows to deal with.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Same issue here (~650 files). This should not be much. And adding up memory till explorer blows up does sound like a memory leak.</p>
<p>Were you able to find a solution to this?</p>
<p>It drives me crazy having to kill explorer.exe everytime i use sort by date.</p>

            <p>I have not found a solution to this problem.&nbsp; The only work around I have been using is:</p>
<p>1- keep smaller directories</p>
<p>2- switch to sort by date, look at it, and switch back to sort by name which does not leak.</p>

    <title>recover Deleted photos a month ago from a DVD-RW - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            recover Deleted photos a month ago from a DVD-RW</h2>
                    <p>Accidentlly deleted photos from a DVD-RW about a month ago. A recovery co. and I both tried to recover from the DVD and it tells me there is no such disc as E:\ which it is on.</p>
<p>The photos were put on the DVD approximately 5-6 months ago. Any chance of recovery from the hard drive? after this length of time.
</p>
<p>Also I have a back up that I think they are on but I can't find them. I have never tried to recover from a back up so I am iliterate to this process.</p>
<p>I'm running Vista Home Basic with Windows Live. The pictures were in Windows Live photo Gallery.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            <p>You 're welcome and thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
I had my doubts that recovery from the hard drive <br />
would be successful. A deep scan may yield more<br />
results but if time has passed since the deletion <br />
the files are probably overwritten and unrecoverable.<br />
<br />
You did not mention the Original Images folder...<br />
did you find anything there?<br />
<br />
How_exactly_was the backup&nbsp;cd created?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First...there is one possibility for recovery if any or <br />
all of the files had been edited in Windows Live <br />
Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
In Vista...WLPG archives the original unedited <br />
versions at the following location...<br />
<br />
C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\Appdata\Local\Microsoft\<br />
Windows Photo Gallery\Original Images.<br />
<br />
It may be a Hidden file...change the following setting<br />
if necessary:<br />
<br />
Go to...Control Panel / Folder Options / View tab.<br />
Tick..."Show Hidden Files and Folders" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Recover From Hard Drive...<br />
<br />
Recovering from the hard drive is very doubtful after<br />
such a long time...the files would more than likely be <br />
overwritten by now.<br />
<br />
There are software programs designed to recover<br />
deleted files. The following freeware is one example...<br />
a Google search will find more.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

Recuva Downloads (builds)<br />
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/builds</a><br />
<br />
Best bet would be Portable version on a memory<br />
card or Flash Drive. (reduces chance of overwriting<br />
deleted files)<br />

<h2>            File History says running for the first time but has been on for months</h2>
                    Hello - I am trying to help a gentleman who works of a specific word document every day but some times he gets confused and this time he deleted the content of the document, the file still exists but is blank now.&nbsp; No problem, I use File History, go back
 a few days and restore an earlier version (has been working for the past 8 months) But today when I open File History is says it is running for the first time and have to wait until is was done, when it was done all I could see is today's date and NO previous
 date or versions that I could restore. So are the older version gone?&nbsp; Is there a way to access/restore them?&nbsp; There were no error messages that File History had stopped working.&nbsp; Any suggestion would be appreciated!

            Mine has not run since December 2017 even though it says it has.
<br />Apparently the March updates might have fixed the file history and have been hearing users stating so.
<br />It's been up in the air a lot if they will continue supporting file history.
<br />If you want something you can rely on many of us at MS community like Macriums solution.

            yes mine says it has been working but no backups actually happen.
<br />so even though it says "it's working" it really isn't.
<br />Also make sure that you set how far back you want to keep your file history.
<br />So start - settings - update and security - backup<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54f4898e-edd5-4073-acd0-d744c3b192eb?upload=true" />

            I appreciate your feedback but the settings were fine, every hour and keep forever.&nbsp; And we know that it made back ups because we already restored from the backups a couple of time but now File History does not see any backups other than todays.&nbsp; So why
 can't I access the older backups? And why does File History think today is the first time it has run?&nbsp; If you look at the external drive you can see older backups you just can't retrieve anything from them.

            That i can not answer then.
<br />This is why many of us don't use this method.  We turned it off on all our computers at the office and use a GPO for folder redirection now.
<br />
<br />The only thing I can think is the account that is associated with the old backups might be corrupt therefore can't retrieve the backups.
<br />Maybe recreate or create a new account to get the backups.

<h2>            XCOM 2 will not launch on my console</h2>
                    
<p>I pre-ordered XCOM 2 over a month ago now, and I have been waiting patiently to play this game. &nbsp;While it did install the game prematurely a few weeks ago, I am now currently stuck with the label for my game as "pre-ordered" as of
 9:55 am EDT, and I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game. &nbsp;Also, when I go the the Digital Deluxe Edition page in the Xbox Store, it says that I have to buy the game all over again, when I have already purchased the content and am waiting to play
 the game. &nbsp;No error codes, just a box that says, "You're too early. &nbsp;Please wait for the release day to play your game. &nbsp;Go to the store page to find the release date." &nbsp;I just want to play XCOM 2.</p>

            <p>Follow Gerry's advice, it is something that should be done at intervals anyway. I am not an electrical engineer, but I suspect that attaching an antistatic wrist strap to a PC case
<em><strong>after</strong></em> taking out the mains lead would be unlikely ground you.</p>
<p>If the offending fan continues to be noisy, which experience tells me it most likley&nbsp;will, you must first identify which fan (or fans)&nbsp;is (are) causing the problem.</p>
<p>Inside your PC there <strong><em>could </em></strong>be fans in any or all of the following places...</p>
<ol>
<li>On top of the CPU heatsink</li><li>On the rear of the case</li><li>On the front of the case</li><li>On the top of the case</li><li>On the graphics card</li><li>Inside the power supply unit</li></ol>
<p>I have even&nbsp;(once) seen a fan on a motherboard chip, though never on a Dell (I assumed this was a graphics chip but didn't check if this assumption was correct).</p>
<p>Inside many Dell PCs the rear case fan doubles up as a CPU heatsink fan.</p>
<p>Identifying the fan will almost certainly involve running the PC with the side/cover removed. If you are not comfortable doing this then take the PC to a repair shop. The cost should not be more than around £15-20 (i.e. UK pounds Sterling), maybe a bit more
 if it is the CPU heatsink fan. If it is more than that get them to justify it. If it isn't immediately obvious visually (sometimes the fan can be seen to be stuttering/vibrating), then a rubber/plastic tube, with one end to the ear and the other end pointed
 toward&nbsp;the various fans in turn should assist diagnosis.</p>
<p>Once you have identified the fan, you need to source an exact replacement and fit it. Fans are typically&nbsp;measured in two dimensions (two of the three dimensions are the same). It is important to make sure that both dimensions are the same when purchasing
 the replacement. Fitting should be relatively straightforward for a case fan, less so for other fans. Replacement of a CPU heatsink fan may involve removal and/or replacement of the heatsink too, which would also mean replacing thermal conductivity compound.
 Replacement of a power supply unit fan involves disconnecting all power leads, removing the power supply unit, disassembling the PSU, replacement of the fan and the reverse processes. Sourcing a replacement&nbsp;graphics card&nbsp;fan may prove difficult and may only
 be achievable by replacement of the whole unit rather than just its fan (more expensive).</p>
<p>If you feel replacement is beyond you my advice is take the PC to a repair shop and get a quote before authorising repair.</p>
<p><strong><u>When replacing a fan it is vital that you direct the airflow in the correct direction, i.e. the blade orientation must be the same as the way Dell did it during their manufacture.</u></strong></p>

<p>Many computer repairers have a minimum labour charge.&nbsp;This is probably&nbsp;the reason&nbsp;why I found your estimated cost so competitive.&nbsp;I should make it clear I am a&nbsp;computer user&nbsp;and do not repair computers for a living.</p>
<p>No dossiers here. I had not placed you in the UK. </p>

<blockquote>What size hard drive does Windows XP Pro SP3 support on the promary partition?</blockquote>
<p>For 32-bit XP:</p>
<p>The maximum partition (and disk) size is a function of the operating system version. Windows XP and the original release of Windows Server 2003 have a limit of 2TB per physical disk, including all partitions.</p>
