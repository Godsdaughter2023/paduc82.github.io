<h2>            Windows 10 updater using all my data allowance &#40;again&#41; even though the update was cancelled.</h2>
                    <p>I have a new windows 10 laptop and it is costing a fortune in data. I do not have access to regular data so rely on WiFi in cafes or local libraries or my &nbsp;4g dongle(not WiFi). Windows 10 updating program is using my expensive dongle data even when the update
 was canceled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously the computer has downloaded the data for upgrade then dump it when the upgrades failed. I have tried using Windows remote help, however they did not seemed to do much other than re load the windows 10 update program, and said that the computer
 would not now access data unless I used the program, and claimed the problem with failed installation of upgrade should be fixed. The help centre promised to send an email to confirm what they did, but I have not received any advice after four days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand the update is over 3Gb, based on downloading over 300Mb to get just 10% through the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently windows 10 is not a viable system for mobile computing solutions. Has any one seen recent discussing on this issue (this year please).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step if not resolved is to return the computer to get a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one know how to get someone at Microsoft to respond to these issues, the call centre staff did not seem to know that much more than I do, and refuse to communicate by email, which they have been told is the best way to communicate now that I do not have
 data to for remote connections, again!</p>

<p>Noel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I get it now - the link that does not respond is Settings, Network &amp; internet, Status, Change connection properties.&nbsp; You can also get to the same place through Settings, Network &amp; internet, WiFi/Ethernet, Manage known networks.&nbsp; Hopefully that item
 will respond correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my text in section 2 of my big post should have been this {I have also edited that post to keep everything in one place for future reference}</p>
To set the metered property, check&nbsp;you are logged in to an Admin account [Settings, Accounts, Your info] then go to
<ul>
<li>Start menu,</li><li>Settings, </li><li>Network&nbsp;&amp; internet, </li><li>Status {<em>for the current connection</em>}&nbsp;or else&nbsp;WiFi / Ethernet {<em>for other connections you have used
<strong>as well as for the current connection</strong></em>}, </li><li>Change connection properties&nbsp;{<em>for the current connection</em>}&nbsp;or else&nbsp;Manage known networks,
</li><li>Set as metered connection - On.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you get this all working the question of why the first location [Settings, Network &amp; internet, Status, Change connection properties] does not work arises.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>I have not previously noticed anybody reporting that problem &amp; nothing obvious springs to mind.&nbsp;
</li><li>I have not used a dongle for my internet connection for five years and never learnt much about it even before that.&nbsp;
</li><li>You could&nbsp;identify the cause of the problem&nbsp;the next time you go to the library / internet caf√© / ... and connect to their network.&nbsp; If the problem is the same with their network then Windows has a fault otherwise it would seem to be the dongle or its software.&nbsp;
</li><li>If Windows is at fault, I suggest using SFC-DISM procedures - see <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
SFC and DISM - ZigZag Forum article</a>.</li><li>You mentioned that you had updated the dongle's software.&nbsp; Perhaps a complete reinstallation of the latest version of the software &amp; the dingle's drivers might fix things.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>
<p>Denis</p>

    <title>cannot sign into xbox live - lost password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunshinethread7  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot sign into xbox live - lost password</h2>
                    
<p>My son created his gamertag and account several years ago. This weekend it has asked him to reconfirm his microsoft account and password in order to let him onto xbox live. Unfortunately, since the account was created we have changed ISP and hence email
 addresses so we</p>
<p>a) know the original email account linked with the gamertag but not the password</p>
<p>b) can't use the password reminder service as it sends an email out to the address that no longer exists</p>
<p>c) can't use the recover account process as the email address is so ancient that I do not have enough info on it to convince the service that it was ours.</p>
<p>Surely there is some way for me to prove the gamertag is ours and get it switched to link with one of our current email addresses?</p>
<p>I can give the credit card used to activate the Xbox live account and all recent payments, but have no idea who to contact or how to request this.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> Call support with those rejection emails that said you didn't have enough information, and at home near the console because they will also
 need the console ID# to prove ownership. If they can prove ownership and grant a password reset your WLID will still be that ISP email, then once your able to sign in you can work on changing the WLID, just remember that is still going to be your login credentials
 until you properly change it on the console. </p>

<p>Please in the future never use an ISP/School/Military emails. Once you are able to sign in you will need to create a new MSA (Microsoft Account) on account.live.com. Make sure your not signed in, and go to "Don't have a microsoft Account, sign up now!" and
 make a new MSA out of a good email that's not attached to any gamertag. I would suggest just creating your child's first professional email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or something. Then to change it

    <title>No led notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> verathijssen  say:</h3>
<h2>            No led notification</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just received my Samsung galaxy S7 with android 7.0 and I get notifications when I receive new messages, but not always. Sometimes I get new messages only when I open the app. But what I really want to know: there's no blue led notification like always.
 I checked settings and it says that it should work. I checked the internet but couldn't find anything...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback, we do not currently utilise the LED notification option on Samsung devices.<br />
<br />
I will ask the team for some input here but it maybe something we need to capture in the feature suggestions board.</p>

            I suppose the blue color for LED notification has been changed in the last version(s), because my friends have the same issue. My Huawei P10 Lite has the same problem, no LED blinking when new messages arrive. But if the smartphone gets charged, the orange
 LED (cause of charging) starts to blink when new messages come in. So LED notifition works, but the Skype blue color cannot be displayed. Please change it back to standard blue.

            The blue LED notification light always worked on my Galaxy S7 whenever I received emails on the Outlook app until several months ago. I cannot understand logically why this does not work anymore where it always worked for 2 years previously&nbsp; the time I've
 owned my S7. The LED notification light is an absolute necessity and Microsoft would not be thinking clearly to remove this facility with their already poor Outlook app. When you change things, you are supposed to IMPROVE them, not make them worse. So reinstate
 the facility that shows me a blue LED notification light as soon as I receive an email&nbsp;

<h2>            Ghost Edition Problem. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>So&nbsp; I recently purchased myself a copy of Destiny for the Xbox One and have been playing nonstop (woo level 23!). Without my knowledge, however, my brother had bought me a Ghost Edition for the Xbox 360. My question is can I somehow unlock all of the cool
 extras from the 360 version for my Xbox One? I can't seem to find anything online that says you can transfer it like this. Please help!</p>

<p>all you have to do is enter the 360 codes,since the two versions are one you will get your items.all you have to do is install them.</p>
<p>the ghost items are collected from the vendor for 1 money.</p>
<p>the main items you would want are the seasons pass,the rest are very cosmetic exept the dinglebot.</p>

<p>MY GUARDIANS, STATS AND GEAR</p>
<p>Q. Will my Guardians, progress, stats, and gear carry over when I download and play the next-gen version?</p>
<p>Yes. Whether you participate in this program or not, your Guardians, progress, stats, and gear are shared within a console family (PlayStation¬Æ3&lt;-&gt;PlayStation¬Æ4 or Xbox 360&lt;-&gt;Xbox One) and will be waiting for you when you transition to next-gen.</p>
<p>Q. When I buy the Destiny Limited Edition or Destiny Ghost Edition on Xbox 360, will I also be able to download the Xbox One version of the Expansion Pass that comes with it for free?</p>
<p>Yes, when you buy the Destiny Limited Edition or Destiny Ghost Edition on Xbox 360 and redeem the Expansion Pass by January 15, 2015, you will also be able to download it on Xbox One by doing the following:</p>
<p>- Log into your Xbox 360 and redeem the token for the Destiny Expansion Pass on Xbox Live on or before January 15, 2015.</p>
<p>- Log into your Xbox One using the same Microsoft Account (Xbox Live Account) used to redeem the Destiny Expansion Pass on Xbox 360.</p>
<p>- Navigate to the Expansion Pass within the Destiny content page in the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>- Add the item to your download queue and wait for the download to complete.</p>
<p>A physical or digital Xbox One version of the Destiny game will be required to play this content on Xbox One, sold separately.</p>
<p>Expansion Pass content (which includes Expansions I and II) will only be available for full download once released.</p>

<p>AS for the extras outside of the Expansion Pack I have seen the support refer to them as DLC and not "equipment." While your level and equipment does transfer up with you to the Xbox One, it seems from numerous posts that the Expansion Pack is the only DLC
 from the codes in the 360's physical games that go to the Xbox One. So from what I have read things like the ship, ghost casing, emblem, and Vanguard Armory only work on the 360. But if you do enter the codes and all of it transfers to the Xbox One form the
 360, please post that it did all transfer for you.</p>

<h2>            My sound is not working after a Factory Reset &#40; Windows 10 Toshiba Laptop &#41;</h2>
                    <p>After a simple factory reset ( I made more then 5 in this computer and every single one worked properly ) , 2 days ago , after the factory reset , my sound stopped working , since then i've tried every single Option , from Updating drivers to uninstalling
 drivers , from installing fresh windows , nothing worked , it might be a component mission on the registry , maybe the windows deleted it on the factory reset.</p>
<p>Sound playback shows the green bar going up and down but no sound is played.</p>
<p>Tried setting it to default , etc.</p>
<p>If someone has idea of how to fix it , tell me please , i cant do anything with no sound</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your PC will remove all your personal files, apps and drivers, and any changes you've made. Sound issues likely occur due to an outdated or corrupted audio driver. Since you've mentioned that you already tried uninstalling and updating your audio
 driver, we recommend using the <span>generic audio driver that comes with Windows. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li>Look for <strong>Audio inputs and outputs</strong>, then double-click it to expand.
</li><li>Right-click on the driver associated with <strong>Audio inputs and outputs</strong>, then click
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</li><li>A window will display, select <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64ebcf32-bd3c-43d8-9578-8c7d4d0d05ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64ebcf32-bd3c-43d8-9578-8c7d4d0d05ee?upload=true" /></a></li><li>Select <strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong><span>, then select&nbsp;</span><strong>High Definition Audio Device</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click Next and follow the instructions to install it.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, we also suggest running the </span><strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg69319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">audio troubleshooter</a></strong>. The troubleshooter will perform a diagnostic process on your system that
 will check and resolve issues related to your audio. If the troubleshooter finds any issues, it will be listed in the result with additional instructions you may need to follow. However, in most cases, the troubleshooter will find and apply fixes automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</span><span><br />

<p>You probably get an instant answer when asking Google like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What is a .fyfo file type?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unlikely to be an MS application.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Right click makes screen flash black</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I use right click on a desktop icon or item in the explorer the screen flashes black, doesn't open the menu and there is a heavy spike in CPU usage.<br />
The weird part is that it doesn't do this with all items. For example, right clicking on the desktop works just fine.<br />
</p>
<p>I've already tried several solution but none worked for me.<br />
Some of the solutions I tried are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Restarting Explorer<br />
&nbsp;- SFL/DISM</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Using Powershell</p>

<p>You could try disabling all non-Microsoft context menu handlers and then, if the problem resolves, re-enable them one at a time to see which one was the problem.</p>

<h2>            Always uses this app to open this kind of files</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Win 10 Home. When I tried to open the .bns file, I was choosing the Notepad app to open it. Then, I forgot to un-check the box that says 'Always uses this app to open .bns files'. Now Notepad is always my default app for .bns files but I want all
 of my .bns files just like what it was before, which means there was no icon for .bns files. Do I need to uninstall Notepad? Please help me.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth peripheral devices driver vanished after my windows update</h2>
                    After one of those million windows updates, my driver for&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;devices was lost. It is pretty&nbsp;annoying and if I try to install it via the device manager , it shows that it has failed to find the driver online. My bluetooth works fine.
<div>I use a Sony vaio - SVE15118FNB with windows 7 64-bit. I tried it on the sony site, but can't find it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help!</div>

            Hi Gud,
<div>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>From the issue description, I understand that you want to install Bluetooth drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the complete error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Here are a few&nbsp;methods&nbsp;which you can follow to resolve the issue:</font></span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you want to connect a Bluetooth peripheral device to a computer, you may need to download a new driver to support it. There are two approaches to this: If your Bluetooth device came with a driver on a disc, you can install the driver directly from the
 disc. Otherwise, simply connect your computer to the Internet and connect your Bluetooth device to your computer, then wait for Windows to install any required drivers automatically.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>I</strong><strong>nstructions Installing a Driver from a Disc</strong>
<div><em>Steps:</em></div>
<div>
<p>a. Open the CD-ROM drive on the computer and insert the driver disc that shipped with the Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Wait for a moment to see if the software auto-launches, as most modern software discs do. If the program does not launch automatically, double-click the "My Computer" icon and then double-click the "CD-ROM drive" icon. If this does not launch the software
 but instead opens a file folder, look for a .exe file such as "setup.exe" or "run.exe" and double-click that. You're looking for a Bluetooth peripheral device driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Follow the on-screen prompts, once the software launches, to install the Bluetooth peripheral device drivers on the disc. You may be prompted to restart your computer at the end of the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Letting Windows Install the Driver &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<p>a. Make sure Windows is up to date, as most Bluetooth drivers are included in Windows Service Pack updates. To do this, make sure your computer is connected to the Internet, then click the "Start" button in Windows and select "Windows Update" from the program
 list. This will launch an Internet Explorer window. Click the "Find Updates" button in the window and wait for Microsoft to search for available updates. If it recommends any high priority updates, follow the on-screen prompts to install them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Connect the Bluetooth device to the computer. There are three ways to do this. If you have an internal Bluetooth receiver in your computer, just make sure the receiver and your Bluetooth device are turned on and put your device within range of the computer.
 If you have a USB Bluetooth receiver, plug it into an available USB port on the computer; then turn on the Bluetooth device and put it within range of the computer. If you have another type of auxiliary cable, you may also be able to use it to connect your
 Bluetooth device to the computer without using a Bluetooth connection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Watch the system tray in the bottom right corner of Windows. You should see a notification that Windows has detected a Bluetooth device, followed by another notification that the device has been installed properly. The installation it is referring to
 is that of the driver. If this does not work as expected, proceed to the next step.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. Click the "Start" button in Windows, then click "Control Panel." Launch "Device Manager."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. Expand the "Bluetooth Devices" entry in the Device Manager by clicking the plus sign next to it. Find your Bluetooth device listed under this heading, right-click it and select "Update driver" from the list of options. Wait as Windows automatically finds
 and configures any missing Bluetooth peripheral device driver downloads. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to install the latest Windows 7 64 bit Bluetooth drivers from the link:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.sony.co.in/support/download/502759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sony.co.in/support/download/502759</a></div>

            Thanks for the reply , but you see this doesn't solve my problem. I have my&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;radios installed and they are working. The problem is - when I have to pair up other devices with computer via bluetooth. The error shown by the device manager is -
<div><br />
<div>"The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)
<div><br />
<div>There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."</div>
<div><br />
<div>And when i try to update - the windows fails to find an apt driver and asks to find it on the device manufacturer for it and as i said the driver for -&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;peripheral devices&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;be found , atleast by me.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Program too big to fit in memory</h2>
                    Just installed windows XP media center on a Dell 600M laptop, 512 Mb memory with a 50 G hard drive. Install was fine but when I try to the drivers or any executable application for that matter, it flashes on the command prompt and disappears without ever
 executing the application, file or program. I decided to try running the executables in DOS and captures the error there which was: "Program too big to fit in memory"&nbsp; It doesn't matter what exe I try running. Tried exe's from dell for video, network and audio.
 even tried various Zip extractor programs and they wouldn;t install either e.g&nbsp; winxip, winrar, 7zip, Zip reader. I also tried using a scaled down version of XP pro without the media center, same results. Tried safe mode, same results. Any ideas please?

<h2>            Logitech MX5000 bluetooth keyboard, Win 7 cant find it</h2>
                    
<p>I'm fairly new to Windows 7. My laptop has a built in bluetooth receiver and everything I have read says the Logitech keyboard can connect through that instead of using their dongle. Everything for bluetooth on the laptop is enabled and shows good (no errors),
 I go to Devices and Printers, click add a device, then press the connect button on the bottom of the keyboard. Nothing ever shows up on the laptop. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you for any advice.</p>

            Please keep in mind you are running a Windows Insider Preview build not intended for production and can sometimes contain bugs and broken features. I would recommend you file a bug report using the feedback hub and consider downgrading to a released version such as Windows 10 1803.

<br />
<br />I am sorry, in previous versions of Windows that was possible, in Windows 10, transparency is either on or off, there is no actual adjustment
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Personalization - Colors and you will that setting

<h2>            Can&#8217;t login to windows 10 after resetting the computer</h2>
                    I reseted my computer, and after is done. It asked for a login username which I don‚Äôt remember. I know the password but I don‚Äôt remember the login username cause I didn‚Äôt have to type the username before. Is there anyway to find my username? Or I can no
 longer use my computer. I saw two login options I think i use the local account one before, but i did tried the Microsoft account one. It both failed cause I didn‚Äôt remember my username

            Hi shumgordon
<br />
<br />When you reset your PC ,did you choose to keep your files and apps?
<br />
<br />On the login screen at the bottom left, can you choose a user account to log into?
<br />
<br />If you choose one of those, does the login process still ask for a username or does it just look for a password?

            Hello,
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB:
<br />Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

            That's because WIndows is trying to start and not the booted meda. 
<br />
<br />You must properly create and boot the media exactly as I specfiied without allowing Windows to start.   Windows has no say about what booted media does because it's not running and about to be wiped off the drive if you do it correctly.
<br />
<br />Go back to the top of the steps, read the Clean Install tutorial thoroughly to prepare, and then try again but this time hold the Boot Menu key provided so it interrupts Windows from trying to start and presents a boot menu.  Then choose UEFI media if you have a UEFI BIOS or plain media if not.

<h2>            Best router for connecting two xbox 360&#39;s in one residence.</h2>
                    
<p>To put it simply, I have a Linksys router...doesn't work for 2 xbox 360's in the same house. Nat errors and such. I have spent 30 bucks on Linksys to no avail. I have contacted xbox tech support to no avail. I just want to know a router that works for TWO
 xboxes in the same residence. I am also a idiot when it comes to computers (hence paying $30 to Linksys for nothing), I just want a router that I can plug my consoles into and my computer and play. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Choosing my gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Hey so my cousin recently picked up an xbox and I was helping her set up her xbox live/gamertag. &nbsp;When choosing her gamertag she wanted something to do with her name so her friends would recognize her. &nbsp;Her name is Jania, and when picking a gamertag with
 the word Jania in it, literally everything was taken. &nbsp;The only way to have Jania in her gt would be to put numbers directly after it (ie. no spaces). &nbsp;I even tried something like Jania dfj89341l22fa8, and that was taken. &nbsp;I don't know if it is coming up in
 the mature language filter or something, but I believe it is highly unlikely that they are all taken. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If all are taken then their is a chance that something is filtering it out but you could try doing gamertags that replace the letters with numbers that should be able to work ex. Jan1a or something</p>

Hi Sylvia</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can try resetting Windows Update Components and see if it resolves the issue.</p>

</p>
<p>For what it's worth, if it were me, I would get rid of Mcafee and install Microsoft Security Essentials. It's free and works well with windows. Also it has a lighter footprint in your system which means, it is less of a resource hog.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If decide you want to try it, you must first remove Mcafee using it's uninstall and cleanup utility and you can get it from the link below.</p>
