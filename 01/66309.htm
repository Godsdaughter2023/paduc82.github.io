<h2>            Surface Dock&#58; USB ports not working and Updater cannot find the device</h2>
                    I have been having problems with my Surface Pro 4 Dock -- where peripherals attached to the USB drives (keyboard, mouse, camera) and video ports fail intermittently for at least a year, despite updating the dock. Now the USB ports do not work at all. And
 when I try to run the Surface Dock Updator, I am told to connect to a Surface Dock, although I am already connected. Can anyone help, please?

<p>Hi KarenJune</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. <br />
<br />
The Surface Dock is powering my Surface Book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another Surface Book or another Dock to do the testing you suggested.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected all peripherals and was able to use the Updater, and confirmed that my Dock is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still recommend that I download the msi file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Where to register a complaint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherbolton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where to register a complaint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently had a terrible experience with my upgrade to Windows 10. Everyone I've tried to contact about this at Microsoft just gives me the runaround. Here's the story:</p>
<p>
</p><div>I wasn't sure where to provide feedback, but thought I would start here. I am usually a very easy going person and am easy to support. I work helpdesk and so I understand how frustrating rude customers can be.</div>

<div>I recently purchased a new hard drive to replace my current hard drive. I called the number for Windows 10 activation issues and was transferred 4 times, one of which I was put on hold for 20-30 minutes and hung-up
 on. It only gets better. The lady I was on the phone with for about 45 minutes, before I was hung-up on, had no idea what she was talking about.</div>

<div>She asked if I had upgraded to Windows 10 from the Windows Media Tool, or whatever software Microsoft was using for the upgrades. I let her know that I originally did, but had done a few things since then. I told
 her that I had troubles with my hard drive and had done another clean install of Windows 10. I then had further problems later, so I decided to purchase a new solid state drive. I did a clean install of Windows 10 on the new hard drive, but was unable to activate
 the key.</div>

<div>This is where her brilliant troubleshooting comes into play. She informed me that because it was a new hard drive and a new OS I had to activate the key. I kept reiterating that the key was an active key and was
 the OEM license on the bottom of my computer. She then told me that in order to fix the problem I would need to insert the old hard drive, reinstall Windows 7, activate Windows 7, and redo the upgrade to Windows 10. After the upgrade, I would then be able
 to activate Windows 10 on my new hard drive. I’m sure whoever is reading this can appreciate the magnitude of the time it would take to perform these steps.</div>

<div>I told her that there was no way I was going to reinstall two operating systems and reactivate a key for which the active key was already migrated to. I said that there has to be another way. She said that there
 was. I could input the old hard drive and set Windows back to 7. I changed the hard drive and followed her steps. When we got to the section where she asked me to set Windows back, what do you know. There was no Windows 7 because it was a clean install, I
 just want to point out that I repeatedly told her this in the phone call. She then asked if I could check if it was active, you remember me telling you I had already told her this. I told her it was active. I also pointed out to her that for both instances
 I had given her the answers she needed. At this point, about 30-45 minutes in, I decided I needed to speak with someone else. I asked to speak to her supervisor, or pretty much anybody else besides her. I had been transferred three times at this point, giving
 my product key to each person, and was purposefully asking to be transferred away from this person who had no idea what they were talking about.</div>

<div>She said that she would transfer me and put me on hold. I was on hold for 20-30 minutes and hung-up on. I know I was hung-up on because when I went and reinstalled the new hard drive again, what do you know the
 key was now activated. Somebody had to have enabled this for me. I know I had an internet connection and even the wizard up with all the numbers.</div>

<div>
<p>I can’t begin to explain how frustrating this call was to me. I haven’t been this angry in years. I was hoping to get the name of the technician that helped me so that I could lodge a complaint. Maybe you can pull up the voice recordings in your logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally had my phone number and the time that I called Microsoft, but for obvious reasons left it out here.</p>

            <p>Hi Afandi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet to be able to perhaps recover your Windows 7 product key would be to use NirSoft ProduKey, you can get it here:
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download genuine Windows 7 installation media from the below link but you will need to have your product key to do so:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, if you need more help let&nbsp;us know and, Good Luck.</p>

<br />
<br />Did you previous have it installed on your machine? This link below will get you the pinnacle studio 14 page. 
<br />

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />On the top right hand corner of the page, they have a “chat now” or a number to give them a buzz. If you’ve already purchased the software, I’m sure their support can give you a download link and a serial to activate the software.

<br />I hope this helps!

<p>There were a handful of them for games on the 360. &nbsp;I remember Halo 3 having a few Vidmaster achievements that were all 0 points. &nbsp;A couple FIFA games had achievements like "Quit 5 Times online" and "Play as a 5 star team online" that were worth 0.</p>

<p>0 GS Achievements are for "Application Discovery". &nbsp;During testing phases for the Xbox One, users were more likely to continue to learn about the app they were using when they were unlocking achievements. (Basically it is a Gold Star for those who are first
 learning) Made them less frustrated. &nbsp;Personally, I do not like them, and do not want them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If they actually added value to my GS no doubt. &nbsp;But 0GS for using the NFL app? &nbsp;Doesn't make it my experience any better. &nbsp;When my mother was using the NFL app, and she popped off the achievement all she said was "what was that for"? &nbsp;I told her, and she
 said "Ok, cool" and moved on. &nbsp;She did not care. &nbsp; But that was just a small sample size. &nbsp;But from what majority of my friends say, they do not care about them either. &nbsp;Again, just a small sample size</p>

<h2>            Connect to Windows 200 Computer</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 7 and was able to connect to older computers on my network that run on Windows XP but I have one older computer that runs on Windows 2000 that it won't seem to connect with.&nbsp; It asks for the username and password and when I put
 them in it still won't access it.&nbsp; Is Windows 7 not able to access windows 2000?

    <title>Windows Creature Feature Update Build 1703..... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yumpin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Creature Feature Update Build 1703.....</h2>
                    <p>I've got to give the little Update Feller an 'E' for effort for diligently trying to Update yesterday.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ten attempts to 'download and install' the Build 1703 as recorded in the 'History Log......'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no joy in Mudville.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>The little Update Feller never leaves any errors as to what his 'beef' is though; so I am not sure what ails it.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do supposedly have the machine (an HP 8100 Elite, 32 Bit machine; with Windows 10 Professional) set to automatically send Microsoft 'feedback' on the back channels; so hopefully they are getting these feedbacks and can decipher what the issue is.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been going on fer man-ny moons now, like months.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patience......&nbsp; Patience......&nbsp; Patience.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the key with Windows 10.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the new Build shortly due out will update instead of Build 1703......</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the HP&nbsp;computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did&nbsp;you do a clean install of Win10,&nbsp;or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Have you ever run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> and/or the <strong>
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What OS Build of Windows 10 Version 1607&nbsp;is currently installed? </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press &amp; hold the <strong>Windows Key</strong> and press the<strong>&nbsp;R </strong>
key.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;RUN dialog, type&nbsp;<strong>WINVER</strong> and press the&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong> key.</li></ul>

<p>1.&nbsp; Computer purchased New in about 2010 time frame +/-</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Believe this machine came with Windows XP Pro installed; which was later upgraded to Windows 7; which was later upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Not that I am aware of; at least I never installed either of these myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; No; never run either of these items</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; 14393.1715</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Yes, all three threads are about the same computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This same behavior was noted during previous 'Feature Upgrades' with Windows 10; it all finally worked out with 'no intervention' on my part, such as a 'clean install' etc.&nbsp; After a few months, it finally upgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to do the same thing again
 with this current Creature Feature; keep running the Windows Update ad infinitum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish Microsoft would pipe up with some insights about this; assuming that my 'automated feedback' is actually being sent somewhere within their corporate structure......</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'update behavior' has been different lately; still no 'error messages' thrown out; but the 'Windows Update' starting page has been showing up 'quite garbled and re-arranged' recently.&nbsp; By this I mean there are two (2) 'History Logs' shown (both are now
 empty; this morning it showed ten (10) 'failed' attempts done yesterday; things like that......</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the new 'Creature Feature Update' comes out in a few weeks hopefully it's install will be attempted instead of Build 1703......</p>

<p>1. Was it a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else when you purchased it roughly seven (7) years ago or was it a used/refurbished computer?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>WinXP-upgraded-to-Win7 is questionable. Most brand-new computers on the market since late 2009 came with Windows 7 preinstalled. Some came with Windows Vista SP2 preinstalled and included a free upgrade to Windows 7.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2. Assuming it was a brand-new computer which came with WinXP preinstalled, did you purchase the upgrade to Win7 or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application or security suite was installed&nbsp;in Windows 7 when you upgraded to Windows 10 on or after 29 July 2015?</p>

<li>Most HP computers came with a Norton or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it. Both applications are
<em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If you're still running Win10 1607 when Fall Creators Update [Win10 1709] is released twelve (12) days from now, I wouldn't expect the latter to be offered to the computer for many, many months - if at all.</li></ul>

</p><p>3.&nbsp; Never have bought any third party anti-virus software separately; if it came on the new Windows 7 disk I bought I don't remember explicitly installing it.&nbsp; Never have run any other than Microsoft that I can recall.&nbsp; Strictly have used Microsoft Security
 Essentials or Microsoft Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not one to jump out and quickly install every new operating system that comes along.&nbsp; I was quite content with XP and held off as long as I could from upgrading beyond it.&nbsp; Windows 8 was a night-mare from what I heard and I avoided it like the plague.&nbsp;
 Finally went to Windows 7 when it became apparent that XP was losing its support eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it became apparent that Windows 7 days were numbered I upgraded to Windows 10 at the last possible moment to get the 'free upgrade.'&nbsp; Windows 10 and this particular machine have not been the 'best of friends.'&nbsp; My other machines have reluctantly gone
 along with all the latest Creature Feature updates to WIndows 10.</p>

<p><span>Hi Craig,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You don’t have to repair Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like a program is throwing this error at the startup and as per the title of your thread, it is HP advisor.exe. I would suggest you to
 try performing a clean boot to get rid of this error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Note: Once the troubleshooting is over, reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform an online virus scan</span></strong></p>

<p>I tried both the clean boot and onecare. Didn't resolve the problem. Other issues have popped up along the same line. Here is a list.&nbsp; .NET-BroadcastEventWindow.2.0.0.ifed012.0:pcdr5cuiw32.exe - bad image, appeared when I tried to access Hardware Diagnostic.
 .NET-BroadcastEventWindow.2.0.0.0.33c0d9d.0:WindowsUpgradeAdvisor.exe- bad image, appeared when I tried to access Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor. Another one was headed WLMailHiddenWindow:wlmail.exe - bad image. WindowsLive Writer.exe - bad image. All with the
 same description as before. When HP Advisor is trying to load, an error message comes up that says "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" and in the window area of HP Advisor it is trying to make a connection to Internet Explorer,but doesn't
 ever.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Craig</p>

<h2>            How to restrict my kids account from going into settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Thanks in advance for the answers....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 5 year old granddaughter that stays with us on the weekends.</p>
<p>I have set up a restricted profile for her.</p>
<p>It works well in that it won't allow her to launch games not suitable for her age.</p>
<p>However, I cannot seem to find a way to keep that account from accessing the settings tab on the xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, although she cannot play a game like GTA V, she can see it in the Ready to install section, and can select it, and can download it.</p>
<p>If she would try to then run it, it would be restricted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to keep her from even seeing those games?</p>
<p>Is there a way to keep her from installing them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you!!</p>

<p>From what it sounds, you have the security settings for their account pretty well covered.&nbsp; There currently is not a way to block the view of those games available in Ready to Install, if it's designated as another users Home Console, automatically.&nbsp; Your
 option there would be to manually hide those titles, which is a cumbersome task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing I can recommend is to submit those ideas to feedback.xbox.com and what you'd like to see implemented in the Family security settings.&nbsp; Let others support your ideas and let the developers see them!</p>

    <title>Hard drive does not wake from sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2trak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive does not wake from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>My computer with Windows 7 OS will go into Sleep mode normally, but the hard drive will not wake up.&nbsp; Both the keyboard key and the power button on the computer will wake the computer (light on power switch activates, fans run, DVD spins) but the lights
 for the HD do not activate.&nbsp; The screen is black except that the mouse cursor is active.&nbsp;I have to reboot with the power switch and&nbsp;go through the message screen&nbsp;noting that&nbsp;Windows did not shut down properly and&nbsp;then I just choose "start normally".&nbsp; &nbsp;All
 was working properly until recently, but unfortunately I don't know what caused the change.&nbsp; I've restored the system to a point two months earlier (which I though was before this condition developed), but it did not solve the problem.&nbsp; I've changed the sleep
 settings, setting&nbsp;hibernate, hybrid sleep and even HD sleep to "never" position.&nbsp; I've run system diagnostic tools and all indicate no problems.&nbsp; Still no solution.&nbsp; I've read some comments on other forums that updates to Windows 7 can interfere with sleep
 mode.&nbsp; Do you have any suggestions as to how I might trouble shoot this problem, or better, what is a solution other than reinstalling the OS?&nbsp; Can the OS be repaired?</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you perform the following methods and check<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<div>Go through the recommended Settings for Sleep and check</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sleep saves any open documents and programs to memory only, and then puts the
<br />
computer into a low-power state.<br />
<div><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you lose power to the computer, you will also lose what is in memory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Main Setting Sub Setting Recommendation </div>
<div>a. Hard disk Set to at least 1 minute before the computer (Sleep after setting below) is set to sleep.Sleep after this is for the computer. Set to at least 1 minute after Hard disk and
<br />
b.Display is set to turn off. </div>
<div>c. Sleep Allow hybrid sleep: Set to Off. </div>
<div>d. Sleep Hibernate after: Set to Never. </div>
<div>e. USB settings USB selective suspend setting: Set to Disabled. </div>
<div>f. Power buttons and lid Start menu power button: Set to Sleep. </div>
<div>g. PCI Express Link State Power Management: Set to Off. </div>
<div>h. Display Turn off display after Set to at least 1 minute before the computer (Sleep after setting above) is set to sleep. Usually set this as the same as the
<br />
h. hard drive is set to turn off. </div>
<div>i. Multimedia settings when sharing media: set to allow the computer to sleep.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Perform SFC scan and Check a drive for errors</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Perform SFC scan.<br />

            <p>I had the exact same issue. Follow these steps to locate your missing program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Metro (Start Menu)&gt;Type "computer"&gt;click on the "computer" icon&gt;in the upper right hand corner of the window you will see a search bar, type "bitt"&gt;you will then see the installed Bittorrent program, left click once on the icon that is NOT a shortcut
 or folder icon&gt;right click the now highlighted icon and choose "pin to start"&gt;you will now be able&nbsp;to access bittorrent from the metro (start icon)&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that was helpful to you.</p>

            I had this same problem. Try looking in the following directory if you are using Windows 7 or Windows 8. C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\BitTorrent. You may need to go into your "Folder Options" under control panel and allow the viewing of hidden files.

            Typical obfuscation replay from a corporate jerk.&nbsp; Duh, it must be your fault, turn it off, turn it on.&nbsp; How can such clueless people hold a job.&nbsp; Windows now hides installed program (they call apps) in a hidden folder.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; To make life more difficult
 for us I suppose.&nbsp; One of responders below finally answers the question..., which you'd think an employee might have been able to do, but f-ing NO, they are too stoopid.&nbsp; Geez, Microsoft how can you not see what jerks your policies make you, aren't you regular
 people outside of your job.&nbsp;

            This is also happening on my Wife's computer. I have tried 6 different keyboards now and including the on screen keyboard as it has a touch screen none of them work. This is obviously caused by the latest update and this needs to be escalated. Most people
 this is happening to cannot even log into their computers.

<h2>            Far Cry 4 will not start&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Far Cry 4 was a first day buy for me since I love all of the games. When I first installed it I had no problems playing it. Now I have not played it since that first day and yesterday I tried to play it. I boot it up it goes to the very first screen that
 is the picture on the front of the box. Then&nbsp;it goes to a black screen and then goes back to my home screen.</p>
<p>I deleted the game, unplugged&nbsp;my One and then re-installed the game. It is now doing the same thing as before. Has anyone else ran into this issue? If so is there a fix that I can&nbsp;get so I can play more of this game? I installed the game directly to the
 One just incase that may be an issue.</p>
<p>Help me One users, you are my only hope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really? That is kind of lame if Live is down and I can't play single player for certain games. That will make me get rid of the One altogether. Not everyone plays MP and games should not have to be hooked up just to play the Campaign.</p>

<h2>            Trying to have Avira and Defender on computer</h2>
                    I have heard that you can't have two antivirus programs on your computer at the same time - however - this is microsoft&nbsp; and I would think that they would make their product compatible with other spyware.<br />
What do you think?

            Avira is an antivirus program and Windows Defender is an antispyware program. There is no reason they won't work together. You don't want two antivirus programs installed and you don't want two antispyware programs running resident. This is not the case
 in the situation you described. However, I think the free version of <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware</a> is better than Windows Defender on XP. Update and run it routinely manually.

            Hi Sasa
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />See this thread for a list of things you can try to see if it resolves the problem:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/618459297891958794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/...</a>
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<h2>            I&#39;m punished for my own team mates killing me on Halo Reach</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing Halo since it first came out, it was the sole reason I got an xbox and threw away my PS1, now on Halo Reach my budies and I are being killed by our own team mates because they either wanted a vechicle or a specific weapon and we got to
 it first, or got the flag or bomb before them.&nbsp; It's been going on for months now and it's getting very upsetting.&nbsp; These people will cheat by killing us, we hear the betrayed announcement and wait for the chance to boot the person for maliciously and it never
 comes. That same person or persons will do it over and over on that one map just to get that one weapon, but we can't kill them, I've tried filing a complaint against them and submitting player reviews, but nothing is being done about it, I was just playing
 Big Team Slayer about an hour ago, on Highlands and a team mate by the name of <b>
[Gt Removed] </b>killed me for a sniper rifle, he gernaded me and then shot me for it,&nbsp;he then got on top of me and T-bagged me, being completely sick and tired of this I killed him and he was able to boot me, I am now banned from playing whenever I want and
 have to wait between 10 to 15 min between each match I play.&nbsp; I know the code of conduct and I adhear to it, but I will defend myself against the idiots on my team who will seek out and kill me for a damn weapon.&nbsp; I want my online name cleared and I want that
 person banned from playing, as well as all the others.&nbsp; They make it hard to want to continue buying halo games if this is the crap I have to continue dealing with. I did save the video of that last match I spoke about if evidance is needed, I want my name
 cleared and I want to be able to go back to continue playing when I want.&nbsp; I work hard and when I come home I want to be able to connect with my budies and play with them and not have to wory about some teammate killing us cause he wants the damn rocket launcher.&nbsp;
 FIX IT NOW!!!&nbsp; Take out xbox player <b>[GT Removed]</b></p>

<p><em>You would need to report the people using the in game reporting features for this OP. I don't think team killing is something the PET would act on, but&nbsp;possibly it is something Bungie would frown upon.<br />
<br />
And being a game specific issue you would need to contact Bungie (Bungie.net) on their forums&nbsp;with any questions regarding action taken against your account&nbsp;in their games.<br />
<br />
As far as LIVE goes if you find you do not like playing with a specific individual go onto their profile and set them as an avoided player. This will reduce the chances of you being dropped into a lobby with them in the future.<br />
And if they do something that breaks the CoC or ToU be sure to report them using the tools on your console.</em></p>

    <title>Task scheduler will not run ANY task elevated - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task scheduler will not run ANY task elevated</h2>
                    <p><em>I am using Windows 7, and my computer specs can be found </em><a href="http://pastebin.com/dY1YmUiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="my specs">here</a><em>. Additional details furnished on request.</em><br />
<br />
I have been having some serious administrative problems for seemingly no reason. I just restarted the computer and then all this trouble started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've narrowed it down to the task manager. Other than that, everything administrative works as it should, so long as I elevate of course which has always been a requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, basically, I cannot seem to get my task scheduler to run <strong>any</strong> task elevated (as administrator). The
<strong>only</strong> way I can make <strong>any</strong> program run in an elevated state is to do it myself.<br />
<br />
Here are some screenshots before continuing:<br />

<br />
What you are seeing is a task to start a batch which *should* wait 300 seconds before launching a custom C# program of my own design. I find using the built in timeout is easier than any C# option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However as you can see, when the batch file is started, it says that it is not an administrator. So it is not elevated. Which means that the task scheduler isn't doing it's job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the batch does when elevated manually by me and not by the task scheduler:</p>

<br />
So far I have tried:<br />
1. Checking the filesystem with SFC /scannow, as well as manually. All files are not corrupted and accounted for.</p>
<p>2. <span>Checking if it was a corrupted task. It is not as this happens with every task. I've also created a few tasks since for test purposes.</span></p>
<p>3. Disabling UAC.<br />
4. Enabling and subsequently using the built-in administrator account. Both personally and as the user with which the task will run as. The administrator account, by the way,
<em>also</em> has the same problems I am experiencing. So it isn't a permissions issue.<br />
5. Modifying several registry entries (I put their old values back when it didn't work).
<br />
6. Taking ownership of the timeout.exe file, the cmd.exe file, and the entire system32 folder.<br />
<br />
I am certain I did other things but I've been at this since late last night so I can't remember them.<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me out here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">So I used a restore point from 2 days ago and so far everything is back to normal. I am still testing but regardless I am going to leave this question open in case someone can figure it out or has the same problem.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The restore point's description read (something) like "Microsoft Antimalware Uninstall". So I have a feeling a security definition for MSE had something to do with it.</p>

            <p>To create a task for running elevated or to edit any elevated task, you need to open Task scheduler as Admin [i.e. right-click on the Task scheduler shortcut and select
<em>Run as Admin</em>].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to enter the Admin account name in the <em>use the following user account</em> entry on the General tab.&nbsp; You will get challenged for the Admin account's password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you are always logged in on an Admin account, you need to set the checkbox for
