<h2>            Windows Live Mail puts all email in &#34;Quick Views&#34; instead of my 3 individual Hotmail Accounts listed in WLM</h2>
                    Windows Live Mail has always sent email to my ( 3 ) separate listed Hotmail Accounts, which I prefer to lumping it all in Quick Views only.
<br />
<br />
Recently Windows Live Mail shows I have email in my ( 3 ) separate Hotmail Accounts (with a "number" of how many messages I have), but when I click on my inbox there's nothing there.&nbsp; ALL the email from all ( 3 ) Hotmail Accounts is lumped together in Quick
 Views.&nbsp; EXCEPT for my "Junk Mail", that still is being delivered directly to my listed Hotmail Accounts.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Junk Mail is still being delivered correctly to the Individual Accounts (listed in Windows Live Mail), but my regular email isn't.<br />
<br />

            <p>It sounds as if you have altered your view settings. Quick views are just that - views of a selection of messages in folders, the selection being made on the basis of the Quick view definition.
<em>Unread email</em>, for example,&nbsp;is all messages in all folders (not but junk or deleted items). In your account inbox folders, check that you have
<em>Filter messages &gt; Show all messages</em> selected on the <em>View</em> tab. Check also that you are sorting messages by date and not by some other criterion.</p>

            Thank you so much for your help!<br />
<br />
I went into <i>View, Sort By,</i>&nbsp; and changed&nbsp; <i>"Flag"</i>&nbsp; to <i>"Date"</i><br />
<br />
I have no idea why <i>"Flag"&nbsp; </i>was selected, I admit I'm not a computer techie so I usually never go in and change things.&nbsp; I think selecting "<i>Flag</i>" would only help if you have important messages "<i>Flagged</i>".<br />
<br />
Anyway....It's working now, all my Windows Live Mail is sending the email to my 3 different hotmail accounts.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!&nbsp; I really appreciate your help!!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />

If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

            Yes, they are on the same floor and the router is at the same location nothing has changed<br />
<br />
the problem isn't about the router as I tried being in different places I used to be in and try on different routers but the problem is still there, I think it's something wrong happened somewhere in the last windows update.

<h2>            &#34;We&#39;re sorry, but you can&#39;t go back&#34; message when trying &#34;Go back to...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just had a perplexing and embarrassing experience. My sister has been a little reluctant to accept the upgrade to Win 10. When she was over earlier today, I gave her a little tour of my Win 10. I pointed out she had nothing to lose and the advantage of
 accepting the upgrade now during the free period gives her a free Win 10 for the life of her computer and that if she didn't like it, she could always go back to Win 8.1, or even just accept and revert back right away. I explained that Microsoft built in a
 rollback option that she could use anytime within the first month after upgrading to go back to 8.1 and that it would be as it was before the upgrade.<br />
<br />
I opened settings to the recovery page to show her the "Go back" button, clicked on it so she could see next few pop-ups and how easy it would be, but I got this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07ba9a08-5190-4fbf-a4af-4fb6a547c2a8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I tried to assure her it was just a glitch, that many others have experimented and reported that it works fine, that I must have accidentally done something to disable it and that there were other options we could use if it didn't work for her to get her back
 to Win 8.1, but she is now more hesitant then ever.<br />
<br />
Even though I have no intentions of going back to Win 8.1, that option should still be working since we are only 2 weeks into the one month period. I had checked it on 7/29 after upgrading and it was functional then. Since it said "files were removed", I checked
 to see if I still had &nbsp;$Windows.~WS, $Windows.~BT, and Windows.old folders. They were all there and all had subfolders and files. However, when I opened the "recovery" folder in Windows.old, it was empty. No one else has access to my computer and I KNOW I
 did not intentional delete/remove anything from that folder.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I can think of that may very remotely have anything to do with this, is that a few days after upgrading, I downloaded the MCT, created a disc of the ISO file, as I was starting move the files to an external drive, I accidentally double clicked
 on the ISO and got a popup saying "Windows loading". I couldn't stop it so I shut the computer down. When I started it back, it was extremely slow, I mean snail slow, but it did load and the few things I tried worked, but I didn't like the slowness, it was
 slower than Vista. I restarted it opening Recovery before boot, went into Cmd Prompt, ran "sfc /scannow" - no issues, ran "dism" cmds both offline and later online - nothing. Checked for a restore point and found one was automatically created when I did the
 upgrade on 7/29. I ran "Restore" and everything was back to normal. I then completed moving the MCT and ISO to an external drive.<br />
<br />
I realize I have other options to refresh/reinstall Win 10, but I can't see how that would have any effect on the missing "Recovery" files in Windows.old.<br />
<br />
So any ideas as to what happened, how/why are the recovery files missing? Anyone else experiencing this?</p>

            AHA!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you both <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7c4f7db9-d117-4ee1-b56a-705619000d19" title="Alan B">
Alan B</a> and <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5801baba-0fd4-4921-a759-f9aeb3ffbb9e" title="Phoebeby">
Phoebeby</a> for providing this information, it certainly fits as the probable reason for the empty "Recovery" folder under the "Windows.old" folder for the scenario above ...<br />
<br />
However (1):<br />
As an addendum/edit to my original post, I stated that I moved the MCT and ISO to an external drive AFTER the Restore, I actually moved them BEFORE using the Restore point of 7/29, which should mean the MCT should have no bearing since it was not downloaded
 and run until a few days after 7/29. I don't recall if I still had my external drive connected during the Restore operation or not, but again that should not matter either since the Restore only affected the C: drive.<br />
<br />
However (2):<br />
Even though I said above that I had no intention of reverting back, I decided to do some experimenting since I am retired and have spare time and another computer to use running a dual boot of Vista Home Premium and Insider Build 10532.<br />
<br />
My machine with the RTM Windows 10 Home is a Toshiba Satellite C55t-A that came with Win 8 preinstalled, updated to Win 8.1 through the Widows Store shortly after availability, upgraded to Win 10 via a forced Windows Update path on roll out date of 7/29. All
 showed as being activated.<br />
<br />
A capsulation of my experiment started on 8/24:<br />
<br />
1. Selected "Restore factory settings" under "Reset this PC" on Recovery page.<br />
2. As the re-install of Win 8 was completing, I received an error popup stating a .dll could not be installed. I clicked OK and install completed.<br />
3. Ran the sfc /scannow which found and corrected the errors.<br />
4. Set as current a "custom refresh image" I had made a while ago, then used the "Refresh my PC" in Win 8 recovery, in order to avoid most of the almost 200 updates.<br />
5. With "Refresh" completed, I ran Windows Update to accept the few remaining updates as well as Toshiba's Service Station to accept their software updates.<br />
6. Checked activation, was activated.<br />
7. With Win 8 now up to date, went to Windows Store to accept update to Win 8.1.<br />
8. Hit "download" in Store, received "this app not installed" with message "getting your computer ready". I gave it several hours to no avail. I didn't recall it taking that long on several previous occasions when I had gone back to 8 then updated to 8.1. I
 shut computer down, it was late, went to bed. Next morning, went to Store, selected download, same messages as night before, no advance after 2 hours.<br />
9. Decided to start over with Win 8 again, but this time I installed 8 using the Recovery DVD's I had made using the Toshiba Recovery Media Creator shortly after purchasing my computer. This time reinstall went smoothly with no error messages.<br />
10. Even though no errors, repeated sfc/scannow cmd, was given complete bill of health.<br />
11. Repeated steps 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.<br />
12. Got the same messages as previously, but after about a half an hour, received message that Win 8.1 was now ready for download and install.<br />
13. 8.1 finished install without a hitch.<br />
14. Run cmd sfc/scannow, Fine.<br />
15. Did not have a "Custom Refresh Image" to use. For some unknown reason, the "recimg" is not available for use in some Toshiba computers in Win 8.1, although it works fine when running Win 8 as documented in this and other threads:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/bad-cwindowssystem32migwizmigcoredll/2bda2cfc-e841-4fd3-9501-a0427fbec72c" title="I wanted to create a custom refresh image to be used in case I ever need to use the Refresh option again, now that I have updated to 8.1 and have removed the bloatware I didn't want and installed what I do want. I updated to 8.1 last week, but an issue with an outside driver update caused me to use the Refresh option. It took almost 12 hours to refresh back to 8, install the 100+ updates, re-update to 8.1 again, &amp; uninstall/install the various items I did/didn't want. Obviously, I don't want to have to go through all that again. As an administrator, I was using cmd prompt to create a custom refresh image but was halted at">
Bad C:\WINDOWS\system32\migwiz\migcore.dll</a>. I did have "System Image" discs that I had made for Win 8.1 on 7/29 just before upgrading to Win 10. However as I followed the instructions to a "T" using the "Restore form an Image" option through "Advanced"
 from "Troubleshoot" , I received the message "no restore image found" when the all important disc #3 was in the optical drive. I opened it up in File Explorer and found it to be void. Must not have completed making my System Image on 7/29.<br />
16. Ran and accepted all updates through the Windows Update Center as well as the Toshiba Service Station.<br />
17. Checked activation, was activated.<br />
18. The Windows icon appeared in my bottom tray. I opened it and "reserved" Win 10 again. It was now late, so decided to go to bed and deal with upgrading in the morning. My thoughts were I had 3 options: a) If upgrade available when I opened Windows Update,
 I would try that path. b) If not, I would try forcing by deleting everything in the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download folder and running the "wuauclt.exe /updatenow' cmd. which I had used on 7/29 to install Win 10 originally. Or c) Download MCT for
 Win 10 or reconnect the external drive I already had the MCT and ISO on and select the "Upgrade" option.<br />
19. Next &nbsp;day, checked Widows Update, Win 10 was ready for processing.<br />
20. Before hitting the "Update Now" button, I used the Win 8.1 System Image Backup tool found on File History in the Control Panel to create a new System Image, which I made sure completed properly this time and checked them by opening in File Explorer to make
 sure they all had the required information on them this time. I also redid the USB Repair Drive and double checked that it was bootable.<br />
21. Now accepted the "Update Now" for Win 10.<br />
22. Download completed smoothly, just as Microsoft intended.<br />
23. Checked activation, was activated.<br />
24. Checked the $Windows.~WS, $Windows.~BT, and Windows.old folders. They were all there and all had subfolders and files. The "Recovery" subfolder of the "windows.old" folder contained information. The "Windows.old" folder alone contained over 18 gigs., just
 shy of half of the 38 gigs of total occupied space.<br />
25. Pulled up "Recovery", hit "Go Back To Windows 8.1", got popup asking why wanted to revert. All looked well.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I was curious to see if the "Go Back ..." option and the Windows.old would disappear after the "month", be it 28 or 30 days, from the original Win 10 install on 7/29, or if one is given a new "month" window starting on the new re-upgrade date.<br />
<br />
I checked on the next day, 8/27, to see if "Go Back..." was still available, it was fine, as was the information in the "Recovery" subfolder in "windows.old".<br />
<br />
I set this computer aside in order to experiment with the new preview Build 10532 on my other computer.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, 8/30, I fired this one back up. I went to "Recovery", "Go Back..." only to find the return of "We are sorry,,,". The $Windows.~WS, $Windows.~BT, and Windows.old folders were all there and all had subfolders and files with information, except again
 the "Recovery" subfolder of the "windows.old" folder was empty. Windows.old was still over 18 gigs.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, as is evident above, I was very careful during the installations. I did not delete anything. I did not run any internal or external cleanup operations/utilities/tools. I did not have any external devices connected at any time nor did I have this
 computer connected to my home network during this time either. And most importantly, I did not download the Win 10 MCT nor move the already downloaded MCT and ISO file from my external storage onto this computer.<br />
<br />
Given the above, any other ideas as to what happened, how/why are the recovery files missing?<br />
<br />
I may experiment more by either doing the whole process over from Win 8 to Win 10, or try using my Win 8.1 System Image to jump back, or even try both, but use the upgrade path through the MCT to see if the "Go Back ..." option behaves differently. Unless someone
 has already tried that and wishes to report their results here or provide a link to another thread where they posted their results.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for trying to find and provide an answer.

<p>I believe you can <em>download </em>the Windows 10 MCT with impunity.&nbsp; What you must not do is actually
<strong>run</strong> it, because it overwrites at least one of the&nbsp;$Windows folders which, apparently, are needed to rollback.&nbsp; I ran&nbsp;the MCT&nbsp;on a Windows 7&nbsp;machine I have no intention, yet, of upgrading (to create media to repair a netbook I had upgraded).&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 Windows 7 computer&nbsp;now has a $WINDOWS.~BT folder and a $Windows.~WS folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Losing the contents of the C:\Windows.old\Recovery folder is something different entirely.</p>

                    I have an Acer Aspire One AOD257 currently running Windows 7 Starter (dual-booting with Ubuntu MATE) and I want to upgrade to Windows 10. The last time I tried upgrading, it went in a loop. It said "Downloading Windows 10", then it said "Verifying Download",
 then it gave me some notifications and it restarted. Is this supposed to happen? What should I do?

<p>Luckily I got the Vista install DVD but the only problem is I can't find the product key for it, is there any easy way to be able to recover it? I have Linux live discs if I can do it that way. I have&nbsp;tried a few programs via wine and neither work.</p>
<p>These are the programs I have tried under wine on Fedora:&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/</a></p>
<p>Any help is appreciated trying to retrieve the product key, thankyou :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unknown Device in Device Mge</h2>
                    <p>In Device Manager under "Other Devices" I am getting a Yield Sign. First driver under Other Devices is a&nbsp; Bluetooth Peripheral, then MAP SMS/MMS then after that is the "Unknown device" - The only things I have hooked up are external drive (My Passport) which
 I got drivers and software from WD site. Then a LG cellphone and use a wireless printer. All work fine but no clue on the other.</p>
<p>Any thoughts ?? Windows 10 ver. 1709 OS 16299.248 HP Pavilion 15 bw-0xx 64 bit&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>I tried the several of the options that you directed me too and none of them worked yet what I did learn from the report is this -HARDWARE AND DEVICES = ACPI\ASD001\2&amp;DABA3FF&amp;1&nbsp; Error code 28--- Sooo, I am not sure what that is but i think it was a AmdAS4
 device at least on my other computer which is the same I had the same issue last month. This unit is a HP Pavilion 15 bw053od and the other unit was a HP Pavilion 15 ab153nr - both Windows 10 version 1709 and 64 bit so is it possible this could be the same
 missing driver ?</p>
<p>Thank You !</p>

<p>Yes, error code 28 indicates that a driver is missing or is not installed on your computer. You may follow the steps provided under the
<strong>Code 28 "The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)"</strong> section in this

<p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>Okay, I went to the Troubleshooter and basically the info that was provided stated that Windows Update never configured to install drivers. Hardware changes might not have been detected.
</p>
<p>Potential Issue that were checked: Windows Update configured to never install drives - Issue not present.</p>
<p>Hardware changes might not have been detected: Issue not Present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issues Found:</p>
<p>PC must be restarted&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart PC to finish install drivers and updates.</p>
<p>Then it say under Find and fix problems with devices and hardware:</p>
<p>Package Version 4.1 Publisher Microsoft Windows</p>
<p>and restart to fix problem(s).&nbsp;<br />
So now I checked the Device Manager and the Unknown Device is no longer in sight.. wooweee that one is gone but,,,,, the other two devices now have question marks by them??<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d4443f2-fb42-49d5-afb3-ac9d2cbf5a23?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d4443f2-fb42-49d5-afb3-ac9d2cbf5a23?upload=true" /></a><br />
Now here's the tricky part - the other day I pulled the device mgr up and the two devices (Bluetooth Perip. and MAP sms/mms) under Other Devices were gone and only the "Unknown" was there. Today I see the unknown is gone but the other two are back. After I
 made the post I wasn't really paying much attention to it so i have no clue what happened to the unknown device and the other 2 there, I tried updating the drivers and got nowhere.&nbsp; I do use Bluetooth with my phone but I would be under the impression those
 drivers would be under Bluetooth at the top of the ladder since under that is my phone's name and drivers under it. So I am clueless as to what the unknown was for or the other two that are still present. If I uninstall those and click hardware changes they
 come right back. The only other wireless device I use is for a Brother All-in-One - MFC 825DW and I checked those drivers as well....</p>
<p>I went to AMD and downloaded the new graphics driver and software which was out of date as well so that issue was resolved and that may have been the one pulling the code which was 28 but that doesn't make sense because the hardware is already there APU
 - so I went fishing and let it be so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there it all is..... I am at the point if its not broke then dont fix it... What would your opinion be ?</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>Thank you for providing us a detailed explanation. Just to verify, have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers? Also, you are correct that one of the general rules with the driver is that if it is working properly, you don't need to change any
 of its settings.</p>

<p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>This morning I opened the Device Mgr and under "Other Devices" I have only 1 of the 3 that were present a few days ago. When I uninstalled them (3) a few days ago and then rebooted I had all three. The other day when I replied as you can see I had 2 of the
 3. Today I have only one which is this one:&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97d5085e-bc2a-4cc8-8eb7-b31f9924ccd3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97d5085e-bc2a-4cc8-8eb7-b31f9924ccd3?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So the Blue Peripheral and the Unknown
 are M.I.A and I have really no clue as to what they are ?? Yet when I looked under properties for the MAP SMS/MMS I got this information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device BTHENUM\{00001132-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_VID&amp;000100c4_PID&amp;13a1\8&amp;235a1bdf&amp;0&amp;B4F1DA07F92A_C00000000 was configured.<br />
<br />
Driver Name: null<br />

Driver Date:&nbsp;<br />

Driver Provider:&nbsp;<br />
Driver Section:&nbsp;<br />
Driver Rank: 0x0<br />
Matching Device Id:&nbsp;<br />
Outranked Drivers:&nbsp;<br />
Device Updated: false<br />
Parent Device: BTH\MS_BTHBRB\7&amp;3144ca0d&amp;0&amp;1</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thats where I am at and when I Googled this info I ended up at HP website yet it was showing a completely different unit that this one. Outside of bluetooth for phone connection and using a wireless printer I am stumped ? Especially while at HP website.
 I have been having a issues in Event Viewer with DistrubtedCOM as well and not sure if these are tied together but I followed the instructions"</p>
<p>Please try to use the below troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on Start , click Run , type dcomcnfg , and then click OK .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Expand Component Services , and then expand Computers .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Right-click This PC&nbsp;, and then click Properties .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; On the COM Security tab, click Edit Default in the Launch and Activation Permissions area.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; In the Launch Permission dialog box, click Add.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; In the Enter the object names to select box, type NETWORK SERVICE , click Check Names , and then click OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; In the Group or user names list, click NETWORK SERVICE .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; In the Permissions for NETWORK SERVICE list, click to select the Allow check box for the following permissions:</p>
<p>&nbsp; • Local Launch&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; • Remote Launch&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; • Local Activation&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; • Remote Activation</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition the ‘Local, In the security policy&nbsp; Service’ need to be configured for the following Policies<br />
- Generate security audits<br />
- Create global objects<br />
- Replace a process level token<br />
- Adjust memory quotas for a process<br />
- Impersonate a client after authentication</p>
<p>- Log on as a service<br />
- Bypass traverse checking</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I performed this: which was easy- then cause Windows 10 Home doesnt offer Group Policy Editor&nbsp; I had to download another program which gave me access and I performed the check as describe above and still am getting DisCom errors !</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/597f07f5-d0f3-4471-8182-21a102f53fdf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/597f07f5-d0f3-4471-8182-21a102f53fdf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c1921d9-5e48-4a38-af66-23489864e0b9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c1921d9-5e48-4a38-af66-23489864e0b9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>so WHEN i Rechecked Event Viewer a few mintues ago I got this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5862fb2-3321-4aa5-a6e4-314bc22b85ce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5862fb2-3321-4aa5-a6e4-314bc22b85ce?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So around and around I go - the Kernel-Power of course create a blue screen earlier.... I dont know- it seems when I track down these errors and try to correct I am not sure I am getting anywhere cause my name is DataDoctor thats for sure !&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts ? This was like opening a can of worms !</p>
<p>Thanks for any input you may have !</p>

 was for future ref. Again, I thank you for the time you have given &amp; insight.</p>

<h2>            Looking for a way to fix this error I discribed below</h2>
                    
<p>I recently downloaded a&nbsp;EA game I purchase though their site called medal of honor airborne after extensively trying to install it to my computer with no success I learned that the game download had wrote itself into a program that it identified with called
 unrealengine3 using the same directory caused a conflict&nbsp;and corrupted the game files.&nbsp;I learned online the unrealengine3's engine&nbsp;was designed by EA using the medal of honor engine as&nbsp;it's prototype. So it wrote itself into the same directory. EA only returned
 my money for the game but now after buying the hard copy of MOHA it still won't install into my hard drive. It runs the setup coping files , but when it gets to the install it stops and rolls back and says my computer isn't modified for the install, yet I
 loaned the game to my neighbor and he had no problem, all other games from EA I haven't had any problems with I've deleted everything that has to do with unrealengine3 yet still I can't get it to load. I have an error in my system information under software

</blockquote>
<p>================================<br />
The freeware Photoscape has a mole removal tool <br />
for small blemishes and a clone&nbsp;stamp for larger ones:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
PhotoScape<br />
<a href="http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php</a><br />
(NT/2000/XP/Vista/7) <br />
(the file to download is&nbsp; :&nbsp; PhotoScape_V3.6.2.exe)<br />
<br />
PhotoScape Help (Tutorials)<br />
<a href="http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/help.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/help.php</a><br />
(scroll down slightly and left click the green Tools <br />
button to see mole removal and clone stamp)<br />
<br />
Maybe the following steps will help you get started:<br />
<br />
When you open the program you will see a circle-<br />
wheel of choices...choose...Editor...<br />
<br />
When the Editor opens...find the photo you wish <br />
to edit in the left pane file tree and double left <br />
click it to open it in the editor.<br />
<br />
Go to...Tools tab / Clone Stamp.<br />
<br />
The size of the stamp can be adjusted by clicking <br />
the three dots or use the scroll wheel on your mouse.<br />
<br />
Left click a portion of the image that will blend with<br />
the area surrounding the unwanted object and then<br />
left click on top of the unwanted object.<br />
<br />
So...the method is to...copy/paste/reset...copy/paste/<br />
reset...until the problem area blends with the <br />
surrounding area.<br />
<br />
Press your Escape key to reset the tool and if you are <br />
unhappy with the edit...left click the Undo button at <br />
the bottom right.<br />
<br />
This will take some practice but you will find that you <br />
cab do some amazing editing with a clone brush.<br />
<br />
When you are happy with the edit...go to...Save / Save As...<br />
enter a new name for the edited version and choose a save <br />
location. Click the Save button to complete the save.</p>

            <p>The earlier solution is a bit tedious.&nbsp; There is a&nbsp; rather simple way to get rid of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Select an email you wish to delete it will have a&nbsp;Trashcan in top right</p>
<p>- Select all emails with "No Sender, No Subject" so that you have a multiple list</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Send to&nbsp;Trash in your original email</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All will go away&nbsp; :-)</p>

            I've found a work around until they fix it. When in Mail go to the top right of your screen to bring up settings. Select it and then select 'options' and turn off 'group conversations.' Hopefully now Microsoft should&nbsp;know the cause they can&nbsp;make a fix.&nbsp;

1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Do you get the error even when the battery is fully charged?<br />
<br />
You are getting that warning because of the battery is low or your battery is bad.

    <title>SOLVED- Can burn dvd&#39;s, data discs, mp3 cds- Can not burn audio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SOLVED- Can burn dvd&#39;s, data discs, mp3 cds- Can not burn audio cds on itunes or WMP- Itunes error 4850</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, thanks for reading. I bought a new computer a few weeks ago in part due to the fact my disc drive failed.</p>
<p>I have an HP all one with&nbsp;Microsoft Windows 10.0 x64 Home Premium Edition (Build 15063), My disc drive is a&nbsp;hp PLDS DVDRW &nbsp;DU8AESH, Rev 6HS3- The device drivers are up to date</p>
<p>My itunes is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using imgburn I burned several dvd's and data discs with no issue so It's not an issue with the burner itself. I can also rip cds with no issue and&nbsp;Itunes will burn songs as an mp3 disc oddly enough .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't tried to burn an audio cd until last night and have not successfully burned one yet. Have tried both aac and mps formats as an audio CD. None are copyright protected files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Itunes burns for a few seconds before stopping, giving me the error code 4850, and once 4251.&nbsp;On the first error itunes recommend turning on Force Optical Power Calibration, but that has not helped.</p>
<p>Windows media player seems like it gets further than that but still states it has not burned successfully. Once when I put the disc back in the drive it shows all the songs on the disc but does not actually play any of them. Just froze up when I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For discs I have been using sony cd-rs and memorex cd-rws. I have tried 2x burn speed and max burn speed with same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done googling on the issue and some of the links to solutions are no longer valid. &nbsp;I only use one profile on my computer and that is the administrator but my programs were not running that way so I did change things so that itunes and WMP run as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded&nbsp;gpedit as well and under local, windows settings, security settings, security options change restrict cd-rom acess to logged on users to enabled and devices- allowed to format and eject removable media to both admin and interactive users,. Also
 tried changing it to admin only, restarted and tried again and nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read it could also be a conflict with burning programs. All I have downloaded are imgburn and itunes, then have what was already pre-installed on the computer. Had no conflicts on my laptop that was also running windows 10. Since itunes does burn mp3
 discs I don't think it would be that but how do I tell if I have a conflict?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some have gotten that error code &nbsp;when navigating way from itunes while burning. I have had just itunes open the whole time but still get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations on where to go from here would be appreciated. I'm about ready to throw in the towel and buy an external drive, see if that would work any better</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and in reading this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT- SOLVED. Was the CD-rs after all. They work fine on another computer but they don't work on mine for some reason. Another spool of cd-rs is working fine on my computer</p>

<p>So after hours of frustration, googling and trying different options I figured out. A simple answer, the discs were the issue after all. I thought the discs were fine since they work fine on my moms computer but I guess not</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried some different sony cd-rs my mom had on my computer and have had no issues burning audios cds with them. I guess it's time to go to the store and buy some new ones. It's so strange that the others wouldn't work on my computer when they work on my
 moms but oh well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and being willing help!</p>

<p>All drivers are up to date. Ran chkdsk/f c: ... It still fails to install. Please tell me where the logs are so that I can provide you more information. I already looked at update history and it does not tell me anything of value other than a series of Kb
 installations and failed to install on each:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB4033631)</p>
<p>Failed to Install</p>
<p>Install this update to resolve issues in Windows. For a complete listing of the issues that are included in this update, see the associated Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more information. After you install this item, you may have to restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a more info link sending me here:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4033631/windows-10-update-kb4033631</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an IT professional (for over 30 years) and the user experience for this is horrible. You might want to re-evaluate what the end user experiences with this never ending series of link clicks, none of which solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failed installations should be noted and the never ending install attempts stopped as this just exacerbates the bad experience also leaving one without use of their computer for over 2 hours at each install and fail back out. You need a process to provide
 support help in these cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other failed install in the update history in the series is:</p>

</p><p>2017-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB4041689).</p>

            The problem was due to and undersized partition where the O/S resides. The existing 100MB partition was not large enough to handle this install and I had to re-partition the drive and re-install everything. Code should be added to generate an error code
 indicating the needed partition size if you want more adept software pinpointing the problem.

<h2>            Huawei Matebook X Pro Earphone Not Working</h2>
                    I just bought a Huawei Matebook X Pro, and I tried plugging my earphones in, but it isn't working. I know it's not an issue with my earphones because I can still listen through them on my phone and other devices. When I plug the earphones into the laptop,
 I get the a notification asking if I plugged in a Headphone, Headset, or Mic, and no matter which I choose, the only playback device listed is the Realtek(R)Audio.&nbsp;

            Hi Karen, you must first change from a Microsoft Account for login to a local account
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Hi john
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Epxlorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address bar and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />%temp%
<br />
<br />That is the main Temp Folder
<br />
<br />Then go to C:\Windows\Temp that is the legacy Temp folder, which may also contain temporary files . .

            Hi William, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Windows 10 recover System Image password fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincentlenngren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 recover System Image password fail</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden I am told that I type the wrong password when I try to restore my laptop using a System Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used this method several times on this computer without a problem. I have *not* changed the password for my account, I use that password without a problem when I login on the same computer. I have circumvented the problem once by using a boot USB
 to access my System Image. That way I don't get the id/pwd-challenge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I used it to do a restore I tried again to do a restore but again I get the denial of my password. Yes the keyboard setting is correct. How the heck do I get this corrected?<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

Hi,<br />
Symptoms:<br />
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You get an error that your password is incorrect when signing in on a PC running Windows .<br />
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a different PC, you can successfully sign in to sites such as account.live.com using the same email address and password.<br />
There are two possible causes for this issue.<br />
<br />
Keyboard Language Layout changed<br />
PCs configured to support more than one language will display the current keyboard language layout in the lower-right portion of the sign-in screen, directly to the left of the power icon. &nbsp;For example, EN is displayed for English.<br />
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you see a language option, make sure you’re entering your password with the correct language characters.<br />
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this doesn’t fix the problem or you don’t see a language indicator, continue reading.<br />
<br />
Webroot Software<br />
Webroot antivirus software prior to version 8.0.2.79 mistakenly removes core Windows operating system registry entries required for Microsoft account sign in. &nbsp;If you are running a version of Webroot prior to 8.0.2.79, you should update immediately.<br />
<br />
For updated information from Webroot, please visit http://www5.nohold.net/Webroot/Loginr.aspx?login=1&amp;app=vw&amp;solutionid=1397<br />
<br />
Here are several options to get back into Windows . &nbsp;We recommend you try these in the order presented.<br />
<br />
Options<br />
If you are able to sign into your computer using a local account, do so and update your Webroot software to the latest version. &nbsp; After rebooting, you should be able to sign in with your Microsoft account.<br />
If you only sign into your computer with Microsoft accounts, and they all return the ‘password is incorrect’ error, you will need to reset or restore your computer to a point prior to Webroot being installed in order to sign in to update Webroot.<br />
<br />
To Restore or Refresh your Computer<br />
Locate the power menu on the Windows sign-in screen. &nbsp;While holding down the “Shift” key, select “Restart”. &nbsp;This will put your PC into System Recovery.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Important: &nbsp;If you’re prompted for a password, enter the password that you used the last time you successfully signed in to your PC.<br />
<br />
Option 1: System Restore. &nbsp; &nbsp;This option will allow you to roll your PC back to a working restore point. &nbsp;Any system changes made since that restore point will be lost.<br />
From the System Recovery screen, select Advanced Options.<br />
Select System Restore. Your PC will restart and prepare the System Restore experience.<br />
Choose an account name to continue and enter the last good password used on the PC.<br />
In the System Restore window, click Next and select the Show more restore points check box.<br />
If one is shown, select a restore point at or before the Webroot installation and follow the prompts to complete the system restore.<br />
When returned to the sign-in screen, if you still can’t sign in, perform the same steps and select an earlier restore point until you are able to sign in.<br />
Once signed in, we recommend you uninstall Webroot until Webroot has shipped an update to address this problem.<br />
<br />
If you do not have any system restore points, you will need to do a system Refresh. &nbsp;This will restore all Windows operating system files, and also backup your files and folders. &nbsp;Any programs installed will need to be reinstalled. &nbsp;This process requires you
 provide the original Windows media that came with your computer, as well as any media you used to install other programs.<br />
Option 2: System Refresh. &nbsp;This option will restore key system files. &nbsp;It will uninstall any third- party applications, but won’t affect personal settings and files.<br />
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the System Recovery screen, select Refresh. You’ll see a screen that explains what actions will occur.<br />
Your PC will restart and a refresh will occur. When this is completed, there will be a file saved on your desktop with a list of programs that were uninstalled. &nbsp;Don’t reinstall Webroot until an update to fix this problem is released, but feel free to reinstall
 any other programs on the list.<br />
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sign in with the same password you used to start the refresh process. &nbsp;Once you’ve signed in, if you have changed your password online you’ll be prompted to enter that new password once Windows fully loads.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
--End--<br />

<br />
I use Norton Security 22.7.0.76 and I use Eng and Swe, both with Swedish keyboard layout.<br />
I am using the password to log in on the affected laptop using my MS-account. I have no problems with the password except when I try to authenticate at Advanced/System restore. Once there I tried both English and Swedish Keyboard setup. My password is correctly
 typed on both layouts. I made sure of that.<br />
<br />
What is really strange is the fact that after I did a restore using a USB boot disk I am back to an environment without Norton and that restore I could use before with the correct password. After the restore I tried to do another restore but it still complains
 on the password. I am pretty sure my problems started after I had KB3172729 and KB3172729 installed. They somehow screwed my graphics and I wanted to resore. It is the first time I had the problem.<br />
Just to clarify. I am currently logged in on the afflicted PC, no problems. I access all kind of stuff using the MS-account with the same password. It is only at the System restore-prompt I get problems.<br />
<br />
I created a local Admin account and it did have the same problem. Something is seriously wrong.<br />
I removed Norton, removed the KB3172729 and KB3172729 still the same problem. Too me it seems like another problem that these forced patches reportedly have created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't got any further reply from MS. It is really weird that this popped up after the patch but a restore from prior the patch can't get rid of the problem. I am considering a format and restart but it will eat a few hours of prep work.&nbsp;</p>
