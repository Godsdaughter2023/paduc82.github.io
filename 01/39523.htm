<h2>            Automatic repair mode does not work</h2>
                    My laptop will not start up. It goes into automatic repair mode which does not work and none of the advanced options work. I have backups saved to a hard drive and usb but my laptop would not accept them. It just keps going into automatic repair mode if
 i restart or turn it off then on. It has windows 10 upgraded from windows 8. It is less than two years old.

            <p>If the hard drive maker has bootable diagnostics, these can sometimes repair a drive but I wouldn't trust it again if it was seriously impaired.&nbsp; The way to know for sure is to run the maker's
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HD Diagnostic</a> extended bootable scan, followed by a full
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/guide-to-using-check-disk-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Check</a> from the booted Windows media Command Line or a boot disk like <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Partition Wizard.</a>&nbsp; If there is no HD Diagnostics then use bootable <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SeaTools for a USB Drive</a> but it will only diagnose another brand and not repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to replace the hard drive I strongly suggest buying an SSD, which is the best upgrade you can give your PC - better than buying a new higher-end PC without one.&nbsp; These are lightning fast and make hard drives seem like they crawl by comparison.&nbsp;
 They're easy to install with videos showing how for most PC models by searching google.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it's in place you can try applying the image we discussed earlier but if it isn't optimal do the best install one can have compiled in

            Can you try going to System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; privacy &gt; Microphone &gt; And see whether Skype is checked or not. 
<br />
<br />If not checked, check it and click the lock to make the changes.
<br />
<br />If this is already checked, uncheck it, click the lock to make the changes. Check it again and click the lock to make the changes.

    <title>Network disconnects after 30min it is connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codygraves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network disconnects after 30min it is connected</h2>
                    I want to start by saying that I have a very basic understanding of computers, so it might take a little patience trying to help me with this issue.
<div>Anyway, I'll try to explain the situation the best I can. Starting a couple weeks ago the computer in my room, which is connected to the internet through a router which is downstairs, has been randomly losing connection to the internet. The computer seems
 to recognize that the connection is there but for some reason it either can't connect back or it can't access the internet using the connection. This normally always happens as soon as I turn my computer on. If I restart my router, the problem is fixed but
 only for a short time. Sometimes it works all day, sometimes it only works for 30 minutes at a time. I know it will take a lot more information than this and I can show you guys everything you need me to as long as you tell me how to find it. One thing I can
 say is that I was using the Hamachi program for a while but after deleting that things seemed to change a bit but they are definitely not back to normal. Another thing to note is that the wi-fi doesn't mess up on anything else in the house except for this
 computer. You can probably imagine how annoying losing connection to the internet at random times can be, so any information that might help is greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks so much in advance.</div>

            <p>Hi CodyGraves </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear from you description but I assume&nbsp;that you, at least try to, work on a wireless network.
</p>
<p>If it used to work fine or works fine sometimes and sometimes not it is not impossible that an external source is causing your issue. Interference in Wifi networks from for instance your neighbours wireless router or access point or a wireless head phone
 or speakers is a likely cause. Also it could be that you have moved either router or laptop to a location where there is a less optimal reception. Also smartphones are notorious in having a bad influence on Wifi routers because of there varying quality as
 you move through the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remedy the first: try and change the Wifi channel you use to another, less occupied, one. Finding a free channel is not really possible but there are smartphone apps that give you an overview of available Wifi access points.
</p>
<p>To remedy the second cause try to establish if the problem exists in different locations. Walls can have various thickness and more or less block Wifi signals.</p>
<p>Try to switch of the Wifi on your mobile phone for a couple of days and see if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the interference going around it is surprising that Wifi works at all.
</p>

            Thanks for the response, I followed your instructions but I didn't see what you were telling me to click. I looked around a bit though and I did find the IEEE 802.1X and it seemed to be disabled already. Another thing I noticed today is I seem to lose
 connection every time I turn my computer on after it was off or asleep. The problem doesn't seem to be happening as often but it is definitely still there.

            Thanks for the advice. I do use a pair of wireless headphones and that used to cause connection problems on my game console, but I don't think that could be the issue because they are off a lot of the time the problem happens. I've tried changing my wifi
 channel before but I don't know if I was changing to a good channel.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;Also, I didn't think it would be this location because it worked fine here for months without anything like this happening, and moving it isn't really an option because this is basically the only spot in the house I can have it. Thanks again though for
 your suggestions.</div>

            <p>Sorry that didn't work for you. Wifi is a complex beast.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;thing I&nbsp;would&nbsp;try is reset the network stack.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> select your wireless adapter in the list and remove it. It will reinstall itself when you
<strong>Scan for hardware changes<em> </em></strong></p>
<p>Another thing to make sure of is that all your Wifi equipment are all on the same mode (b/g or /n) . And on the same Band (2.4GHz or 5.2GHz). If you've lately got other wireless equipment is it important to check those. I assume that you set power saving
 or output to maximum already for the time being </p>
<p>But if it worked you most likely didn't make manual changes here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far the more general things that could be tried. If that doesn't work we need to know more specific what brand both router and adapter. and all the settings.</p>

            Tried the Device Manager thing with no luck. This is about where my knowledge of this kind of stuff ends. Not entirely sure what you mean by all my WiFi equipment being on the same mode. The problem seems to be picking back up again today so I am really
 getting desperate. Just tell me what details you need and how to find them and i'll get them for you.

<p>I didn't write it in my original post, but I am talking about multiplayer titles. There are single player titles out there but those were not what I was interested on while writing this. Enjoy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Oh, video games. Us gamers have sunk so many hours into them to the point where others may believe that we’re very unproductive. But what entertainment it has brought us. For many, video games are providing endless hours of entertainment but some of us it’s
 just getting old. I am one of those gamers who is suffering from boredom when it comes to video games now and every year, and the big AAA titles just aren’t bringing what I want to the table. But I think I’ve found the reason why I am just not feeling it for
 these video games anymore and I’d like to discuss about it. Perhaps any of you reading may agree with my sentiments.</p>
The Exhaustion
<p>Yes, I am getting exhausted by video games. Now this sounds very strange as video games generally excite players when engaged. This also applies to me as well – I too get excited when playing. However it’s after playing that I really feel that exhaustion.
 Now it’s not exhaustion from playing too many hours (though I’m sure that contributes to my end result), but it’s exhaustion from being too competitive. What’s even worse is that this exhaustion from competition can happen after only one short session.</p>
The Competition
<p>Look at the big titles as of late. We’ve got Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Battlefield 3, StarCraft 2, League of Legends, etc. What do all of these games have in common? They are Player vs. Player (PvP) centric games that absolutely thrive on competitive
 play. In these games, the name on the top of the scoreboard is herald as the winner and the objective is to make sure your name is in that spot. Yes, you can argue that these games require some teamwork which is true in most cases but at the end of the day
 it’s all about your own performance. This is where I find the exhaustion building up.<br />
If I perform well in one game I feel obligated to do well in the next game. I cannot have a large drop in personal score. If I do end up performing badly I feel that I have somewhat failed myself. You may think that it’s silly to feel bad over a video game
 but because I find video games to be simple I should be able to play well; it’s not like I’m doing a difficult task. That’s how I feel: simple task, good performance. If I fail at that simple task it just feel bad.<br />
It’s rather silly that I’m just competing against some numbers on the screen, yeah, but there are also many other video gamers out there who share this competitive drive. That’s why we see these big tournaments such as the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM), and Major
 League Gaming (MLG). There is a big drive for competitive play and people are continuously buying into it so that they can see themselves at the top whether at a tournament or locally in a small session.<br />
But this competitive drive does drain me a bit but that’s easily solved by taking a break.</p>
Enough is Enough
<p>I just explained myself as a player who is competitive and won’t accept losses so why am I having issues with these competitive games? The reason is that there are too many of them. Year after year the PvP scene is growing especially with the rapid expansion
 of the internet. Just like how people get tired of eating the same cereal every morning I am getting tired of playing the same thing every year. There are very few non-competitive titles that can match the quality of development of the AAA titles – we all
 want the best so we buy the best. Then in those games, we join a short session and compete, and then join another one shortly after. However every time I play I get exhausted from competing, then I take a break, then I compete again an hour later, then I take
 a longer break for a day, then I compete again, then I take an even longer break that can go on for weeks.<br />
The lack of variety on the market is alarming to me as I can’t seem to buy two different products. Eh, that’s a bit of an exaggeration but it’s not that far off. The end product that we seem to be paying for is the ability to compete against others through
 some medium whether it be in first person shooters or via Tetris. So if I want to play video games, I must play against somebody with the small assistance of ‘teammates’. Can’t there just be a game where I can directly cooperate with others?</p>
No Demand for Co-op
<p>The best cooperative I have ever played is Resident Evil 5. I’ve seriously poured in many hours into this game; perhaps around 200 hours. Now that’s a lot of game time. So why can’t I just go back to those games? The reason why is rather unfortunate as it’s
 because there is just no demands for them. The masses are buying into competitive video games such as Call of Duty and developers/publishers are just following the herd. With fleeting player base numbers these cooperative games just don’t seem to last that
 long which further encourages developers to make more PvP based games to get that bite into the market. While you will find people still playing Resident Evil 5 it’s hard to come across a game that you want to join (I prefer joining games on Professional difficulty
 which others hardly play now).<br />
One can ask about why the cooperative gaming market is so small. I believe the reason is that cooperative play generally takes a lengthy amount of time to complete. Cooperative games tend to be games where a party must really sit down and ensure that they have
 enough time to play before beginning their session. These players construct their game plan together then execute and if they fail, they make up another plan until they get one that works. Now compare that to being able to spare 10 minutes, jump into a game,
 and compete against people for one round. This fits the palette of our modern gamer who generally has a hectic schedule. But you cannot just apply the same logic to cooperative play by shortening the length of time; that directly degrades the quality of the
 game. In game AI can only do so much so making short sessions will exacerbate their incompetence thereby making the game not challenging. One of the best examples of this would be: “Operation Flashpoint: Red River” where its short sessions made for some really
 easy game play. On the other hand real players though can quickly change their plans on the fly in a PvP session so there is always a challenge to be had.<br />
But there are more expensive options for those really wanting cooperative play. They’re known as Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) with the most notable title being: “World of Warcraft”. However these options generally carry the heavy
 price of monthly fees which a lot of people just can’t afford. Might I just mention then that this is why I am looking forward to Guild Wars 2 which is a future MMORPG that won’t have the bane of monthly fees. But if you can afford it, go for it; MMORPGs tend
 to have a lot of content that should entertain you for a long time.<br />
All in all though, the mass market is not seeking for the cooperative play that I so desire and that’s a shame.</p>
In Conclusion…
<p>My generation of gamers are dwindling as the developers and publishers follow the masses for gaming. But there are a few studios looking out for us cooperative gamers. Ubisoft is coming out with Ghost Recon: Future Soldier which in comparison to other shooters
 has a lot of cooperative play content, there’s also CAPCOM’s Resident Evil 6, and then there’s Guild Wars 2 which many PC gamers are pinning their hopes on as their flagship game.<br />
It may only be a few titles, but I really hope that they are quality games that will make gamers like me happy.</p>

<p>Interesting. Now that I really do think about it, my best Co-op experiences were probably H3 and Rainbow Six Vegas II equally.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hopefully more co-op games do come out, because you are right and it does seem to be being put by the wayside :S I wouldn't mind some Co-op RPGs, but the ones I'd like haven't done it and Fable, which is all I can think of, sucked abysmally.</p>

<p>@gameshoes3003 - I didn't read your entire post, as it was too much to read at 2AM, but I get the gist what you're saying. I too have grown tired of the current MP games and video games in general. I still enjoy a few singleplayer games and my buddy and
 I love getting our hands on a good co-op game, but they're few and far between. Most co-op modes nowadays are tacked onto games...<br />
<br />
@ChainSmokingBob - My buddy and I do a lot of co-op gaming and our favorites would probably be the Halo series and Gears of War 1 &amp; 3 (Gears 2 sucked). A few other good co-op games we've played would be Dead Island (currently playing), Crackdown, and Borderlands.
 Hopefully Borderlands 2 and Ghost Recon: Future Solider will have good co-op.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OP -- I agree with you to an extent.&nbsp; I'm just more frustrated by the lack of options.&nbsp; I've grown tired of FPS, or just shooters in general.&nbsp; Would love to see some sort of "gaming revolution" where we start to see the industry head in a new/exciting direction,
 but with CoD's &amp; Halo 4's expected figures... why would the industry bother changing?</p>

<p>There's a lot of demand for co-op and, as mentioned, that can be seen in Gears of War but also in Rainbow 6: Vegas 1 and 2, Rage and the Halo games.</p>

<p>OP: I read your entire blog article. I was pondering this on the drive home yesterday due to all of the recent complaint posts on the forums here about how bored or unsatisfied some people are with the current game market. Simply put, I think the xbox/playstation2
 generation, the gamers who started gaming on the xbox and playstation2 are rather spoiled and do not quite understand just how amazing the current gaming market is. The market is saturated with excellent games with amazing graphics, gameplay etc. PS3, 360,
 even the Wii all have some amazing fun games (I am a mario fanboy at heart and love the galaxy titles) When you compare it to games from the 80's and 90's you have to sit back and go wow! these are great times for gamers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand video game burnout, however, when a game becomes more work than enjoyment, its time to sit back and either accept the current situation or re-evaluate how your time is spent. Life is to short, enjoy everything you can in moderation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hooked on MW3, I love logging in and playing with my friends etc.. You will always run into someone who always takes the game too seriously and you have to usually kindly remind them that "you're playing a video game" its supposed to be fun. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Competition has always been a part of video games, look at pong, the most basic form of competitive gaming.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To touch base on co-op gameplay. I absolutely love co-op gameplay, heck, thinking back I think my first co-op gameplay games were contra, gauntlet, and &nbsp;Ikari warriors on the nes.. lol.. &nbsp;I thought Rainbow Six on the pc was amazing with the co-op over my
 dialup connection. =D<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are into pc gaming at all, Diablo 3 is coming out next month and will offer co-op gameplay.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got married and my new wife asked me to get her setup with World of Warcraft. I've found more enjoyment playing WoW with her as this is a brand new experience to her.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more thing, &nbsp;also highly encourage all gamers to get up off the sofa, floor, pc chair etc, and EXERCISE! Get those endorphins going! &nbsp;it definitely helps with the rut..</p>

<p>nothing personal but we need mics for this achievement as it will make the progress faster for everyone so everyone can get it so we all know what we are working with.i don't care to help out but at the same time we all don't want to be here longer then
 it should take either because it will take some time for everyone to get this.Hopefully you can understand what i am saying and understand i am not being a @@@.</p>

<h2>            I Want to Disable the &#34;mini-scrollbar&#34; that appears on my pointer</h2>
                    Using a Vista OS and Windows Office 2007, I am frustrated by a mini-scrollbar that appears at the tip of my pointer and sends the page in four different directions-- usually opposite of where I am trying to move. Often it will not let go. I want the old-fashioned
 "move it myself" vertical and horizontal scrolls that stay where they belong! (I&nbsp;miss you XP!)

<h2>            Settings and more vanished</h2>
                    <p>Today Settings and whatever else was on the Start menu vanished, apart from Power and All Apps. I do see the apps that I'd pinned to the start menu to the right, and I see my account (and picture) above Power and All Apps (with space between). But no doubt
 much else has gone, although what I couldn't tell you apart from Settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made no recent changes to the system, either in personalizing it or in installing a new program. My anti-virus program is the same as ever. I can of course get to Settings by right clicking on the Start button, choosing Search, and searching for "Settings."

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might have caused to&nbsp;due to some third party applications.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to provide some information to help you better.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Since from when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you facing this issue in Local account or Microsoft account?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Let's try the below Steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check if the issue resolves in
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking.</span></strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer this </span><strong><span>article to boot to safe mode:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
</span></span></strong></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue resolves perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into</span><strong><span>clean boot
</span></strong><span>state</span><strong><span>.</span></strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Method 3: </strong>I would also suggest you to </span>
<strong><span>try creating a new user account </span></strong><span>and check if issue persists.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

            <p>Well, while restarting hadn't helped, it turns out that powering down and starting again has. I now see File Explorer and Settings, and I'm guessing that's all that was missing. Wish I knew what corrupted the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I sign in with a local account, and I in fact resent that using the app menu to Contact Support (or, for that matter, give feedback, although curiously that seems no longer to be listed in the apps) shifts me to a Microsoft account, obliging me to
 log in. As I reported in previous posts, that was scary, as I no longer knew how to sign in.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the system maker's support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Many have software that will control the battery charge which&nbsp;is designed to extend the battery life. Right Click the battery icon near the clock
 and see if there are any selections there to set - of course the software controls could be anywhere on the system - such as App/Start menu, Control Panel, Device Manager, or other locations.<br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
The battery could be worn - <span><span>Use this method to check the battery and create a report :</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span>WinKEY&nbsp;+X -&nbsp;or Right Click in the lower left corner - Command Prompt (Admin)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy/paste or type&nbsp;:<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><br />
</span></span></strong><span>powercfg -energy -output %userprofile%\desktop\energy-report.html</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>hit&nbsp;Enter</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>That&nbsp;creates&nbsp;"energy-report.html" and&nbsp;puts&nbsp;it on the Desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>double click the file on your desktop </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Scroll down&nbsp;to Battery Information :</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Design Capacity</span></p>
<p><span>Last Full Charge<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy&nbsp;and paste those into a reply here so we can interpret them for you.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Also in a Command Prompt (Admin) - navigate to a folder where you have Write rights such as
<br />
\YourUserName\Documents</p>
<p><br />
Type or Copy and Paste each of these and press enter after&nbsp;each&nbsp;: (if C: is where your Documents folder is)<br />
<br />
C:</p>
<p><br />
CD\<br />
<br />
CD&nbsp;%userprofile%\Documents<br />
<br />
powercfg /BATTERYREPORT<br />
<br />
That puts Battery-Report.html in your Documents folder.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

quite a while ago and it's been sitting and doing nothing. I did run Intel tools on it and I also used Macrium to image the original HD and I plonked it down on the new mSATA.<br />
Laptop has been rebooted many times. mSATA seems stable.<br />
<br />
I got to the step in the article above where I'm supposed to boot to the mSATA and load easyBCD to change the drive letter.
<br />
Basically I cloned the old HD w/Macrium and put it on the mSATA.&nbsp; I will say that the mSATA was not completely clean because I also used Macrium to image the old HD and I used the mSATA drive as the destination.&nbsp; I then moved the image off the mSATA to a network
 location.<br />
<br />
Last 'successful' step was going into the BIOS and changing the boot option to the SSD.<br />
When I try to boot I get<br />
Autochk program not found, skipping autochk and then BSOD.<br />
The BSOD is very quick and unusually short. It looks like 2 or 3 lines only. The laptop then quickly reboots.<br />
<br />
The mSATA is MBR and has only one partition.<br />
<br />
The good news is that I can still boot to the original HD and Win 7 still works!<br />
<br />
Apparently this means there is a problem with the boot record.<br />
I loaded the Win 7 disc and tried a system repair. It ran but couldn't repair.<br />
Went into recovery cmd prompt as administrator. <br />
<br />
/bootrec rebuilding - found 0 windows installs<br />
/mbr and /fixboot .... both end unsuccessfully

<p><br />
Let’s first try using the <b><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/cdb4c0dd-5698-4197-b906-d6a6d413621d1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Last Known Good Configuration</a></b>, please do the following:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then
<b>restart</b> your computer. </p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Do one of the following: </p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by
 waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start, and then press F8.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On the <b>Advanced Boot Options</b> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
<b>Last Known Good Configuration</b>, and then press <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If your computer has more than one operating system installed, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system that you want to start by using Last Known Good Configuration, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>. Windows will then resume starting normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you on your results. If this method does not resolve the issue, don’t’ worry, we have other troubleshooting steps that we can try.</p>

</p><p>There is no option on Skype to have multiple chat conversations with one contact. As a suggestion, you can create a chat room for this certain contact that you can use to discuss your projects. We will take this as a feedback and let our developers know&nbsp;about
