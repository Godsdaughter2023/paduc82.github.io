<h2>            How can I get Office 2019 &#40;NOT 365&#41; to open files in offline folders when not connected to the Internet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Around May of 2019, Microsoft released an update to MS Office 2019 (NOT 365) that prevents you from opening Office files stored in an offline folder when not connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Situation:</p>
<p>You configure your computer to keep offline files from your server.</p>
<p>Office 2019 will not open the offline files without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>You move a file from the offline folder to someplace else on your computer and Office 2019 can open it without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>This defeats the benefit of offline Office files because you can't open them without an Internet connection.&nbsp; Moving the files to another folder to allow offline editing means that they won't be sychronized anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Office 2019 (NOT 365) to open files in offline folders when not connected to the Internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is your computer connected to any Domain Network?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the below steps to remove the offline files and clearing the cache and check if you are able to access the files if not connected to the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before trying the below steps, I suggest you to take a backup of all the files in the Offline Folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong>Sync Center</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Manage Offline Files</strong> on the left and select
<strong>Disable Offline Files</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart the computer once</strong>.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then, click on the <strong>Start Menu</strong> &gt; Search for <strong>Command Prompt</strong> &gt;
<strong>Right-click</strong> on Command Prompt &gt; Click on <strong>Run As Administrator</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Once the Command Prompt is up and running, type the following commands one by one and hit

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then, delete the folders under <strong>C:\Windows\CSC</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart the computer once</strong> &gt;
<strong>Enable Offline Files</strong> again and check if you are able to access the files.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you're having issues opening file explorer is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you run the System File Checker. System File Check
<span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>See this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026529/windows-using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Using System File Checker in Windows 10</a> and follow the on-screen instructions. In the event that SFC wasn't able to resolve the issue, click on
<strong>More info on System File Checker</strong> and go to DISM on the thread for the steps.</span></p>

            I also had the same problem so I contacted Epson directly, their response via email "<span>At this stage there is no indication that Epson is going to release an updated driver for the dot
 matrix product and Windows 8. As Windows 8 does include drivers supplied with the operating system Epson would suggest checking if there is a driver for your product with Microsoft directly."</span>

</span></div>
<div><span>The only other manufacture of Dot Matrix printers in OKI and they do offer Windows 8 drivers. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Given this printer is used for printing Employee payslips, and email or similar web solution are not viable for all our customers, it seems our customers either need to buy an OKI printer
 or change to laser printer payslip stationary at x3 price per payslip. &nbsp;Either way, not an expense that employers will like.</span></div>

    <title>Repair Windows Script Host &#40;WSH&#47;scripting&#41; in XP SP3&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Repair Windows Script Host &#40;WSH&#47;scripting&#41; in XP SP3&#63;  &#40;Need a true guru&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    I believe I may have a corrupted Windows Script Host installation, but I am not 100% sure.&nbsp; I'll try to provide as many details as possible.&nbsp; I try to keep my computer running smoothly and can usually fix most problems but this one is driving me nuts!<br />
<br />
About a week ago I installed TurboTax 2009 to do my taxes and noticed that every help link I tried in the program brought up an empty help window.&nbsp; I thought that was odd and in the end I ended up installing it on one of my other computers and it was fine.&nbsp;
 Yesterday I was looking around the internet and came on the idea that maybe the problem was related to Windows Scripting.&nbsp; I saw some people mentioning script errors in 'Windows Help and Support' so I opened it up and looked around.&nbsp; Sure enough, I encountered&nbsp;two
 script errors.&nbsp; For example, if I click on 'Fixing a problem' I get the following error:<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer Script Error<br />
An error has occured in the script in this page.<br />
Line: 71<br />
Char: 2<br />
Error:&nbsp; Automation server can't create object<br />
Code: 0<br />
URL: ms-its:C:\WINDOWS\Help\ntshared.chm::/shared.js<br />
<br />
Whether I click Yes or No to continue running scripts, I then get the following:<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer Script Error<br />
An error has occured in the script in this page.<br />
Line: 492<br />
Char: 10<br />
Error:&nbsp; 'xmldoc' is undefined<br />
Code: 0<br />
URL: ms-its:C:\WINDOWS\Help\ntshared.chm::/shared.js<br />
<br />
The Help window then shows information on "Fixing a problem", but here and there in the text is "XOX".&nbsp; It appears that wherever it says "XOX", it should be saying "Windows XP" or something along those lines.&nbsp; I then tried to open up some of the many CHM files
 inside the Windows\Help folder.&nbsp; Not all of them cause errors, but several do.&nbsp; For example, Magnify.chm causes the first error mentioned above followed by another script error that says "Class not registered".&nbsp; It also displays "XOX" in places as well.<br />
<br />
It seems pretty likely to me that the lack of information in the TurboTax help windows is related to this other problem I am having.&nbsp; I'm not sure when this all started but I suspect it was several months ago.&nbsp; A while back I&nbsp;noticed that Pogo games won't run
 on this computer because it says we don't have the correct version of Java installed.&nbsp; I am now thinking that perhaps Pogo.com uses javascript to determine the Java version installed&nbsp;and maybe that is related to these other issues as well.<br />
<br />
Please believe me when I say I have tried almost everything I can think of.&nbsp; As mentioned above, I can usually fix things like this but I am up against a wall.&nbsp; I have spent hours looking online for help with this and have gotten nowhere.&nbsp; Many sites say it
 is a security problem in IE.&nbsp; I have tried setting the IE security to completely relaxed and it didn't help.&nbsp; I even tried rolling back to IE6 and it didn't help (I am using IE8).&nbsp; I also tried disabling all IE&nbsp;add-ons and it didn't help.&nbsp; I have tried replacing
 as many WSH-related DLLs that I am aware of by taking them off another XP SP3 computer that is identical as far as the OS and Windows Updates go.&nbsp; Didn't help.&nbsp; I was going to do a Windows Repair but for some reason my USB keyboard didn't work with it.&nbsp; I
 suspect it is because it is connected to a USB hub, but I didn't try connecting it directly to the computer.&nbsp; I kind of took it as a sign that maybe I should try to fix it again before doing something so drastic.&nbsp; Unfortunately System Restore is out of the
 question because just a few days ago I deleted all but the latest System Restore file.&nbsp; Why, I don't know.&nbsp; I've never needed to use it before and figured it was a waste of space.&nbsp; Don't worry about the 147 GB of free space on my C drive.&nbsp; I could just about
 kick myself for deleting those now.<br />
<br />
So anyway, I really suspect that something is corrupted.&nbsp; Whether it be files or keys in the registry I don't know.&nbsp; If I knew which registry keys are related to WSH and all of the files that are related, perhaps I could get this straightened out by comparing
 to another XP computer I have.&nbsp; It could be a corrupt IE installation, but I tried rolling back to IE6 and back again to IE8 so it seems unlikely.&nbsp; Also, other than the minor Pogo problem mentioned above, I don't have problems on websites.&nbsp; It seems to be
 related to the local scripting host (as opposed to server-side scripts on websites).&nbsp; Incidentally Pogo works on all of my other computers (running identicle service packs &amp; updates) and it does work on this computer but only in Mozilla Firefox (which from
 what I understand uses its own scripting host rather than WSH).<br />
<br />
I have looked on Microsoft's site and have seen downloads for Windows Script 5.7 (I think it was 5.7) but when I try to install it says that my service pack is higher than what it wants to install so it aborts.&nbsp; I have found articles on the Microsoft website
 that mention fixing or repairing WSH but they are for older OSs.&nbsp; I cannot find any way to repair my WSH installation on XP SP3 nor any advice on doing so manually.&nbsp; I guess I can still break down and do a repair install on the OS but I've never needed to
 do that before in almost 20 years of Windows computing.&nbsp; I know I will just need to reinstall patches but I'd still like to avoid it.&nbsp; I even thought about biting the bullet and installing Windows 7 until I found out I can't do an in-place upgrade and will
 need to re-install all of my games, and dozens of other programs.&nbsp; I'd really like to fix this problem if possible, but I supposed it isn't the end of the world if I can't.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or knowledge you guys can give me on this?&nbsp; I'd appreciate it!

<p>So after we registered OLEAUT32.DLL and restarted, we was able to resolve the issue. So I would suggest the following if anyone has any scripting issues:</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe jscript.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe vbscript.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe wshom.ocx<br />
regsvr32.exe msxml3.dll<br />

regsvr32.exe OLEAUT32.DLL</p>
<p>restart</p>

            Same problem here. For a couple of months now, every once in a while my 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise (v10.0.15063 Build 15063) has been displaying a system message indicating that "SpeechRuntime.exe" is using excessive amounts of memory.&nbsp; I haven't installed
 anything other than MS updates on my system for several months now.&nbsp; When this problem occurs, I just shut down and restart the system.&nbsp; However, that is becoming a pain in the rear.&nbsp; How do I resolve this issue?

<h2>            Bluetooth continually searching</h2>
                    Is it normal in Windows 10 to see this running without stopping under Bluetooth ... "Your PC is searching for and can be discovered by Bluetooth devices" ... or is there a way to stop that? Please do not be afraid to give an answer, even if it is a repeat
 answer or throw up a link where this might have been answered before. Or your reply can even be put to music if you so wish!

            <p>Rakesh, thank you for your reply. I hand thought by turning off Bluetooth, the printer would not work, thinking the Printer worked through bluetooth.
</p>
<p>Anyway, having turned Bluetooth of, I found myself to be mistaken. The Printer still works and the "<strong>Your PC is searching for and can be discovered by Bluetooth devices</strong>" has disappeared.
</p>
<p>But my question still remains and that is, if Bluetooth is turned on, then is it normal to see this, "<strong>Your PC is searching for and can be discovered by Bluetooth devices</strong>" ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, is there no way to stop that? </p>

            I can see this when I open the "Show Bluetooth Devices" from the tray icon. My paired devices are listed directly below that but the "<strong>Your PC is searching for and can be discovered by Bluetooth devices</strong>" remains active. Not sure if it's
 meant to be like that or not. Hopefully someone from MS will give us a straight answer soon....

            That settles that then, but tbh that doesn't really bother me because I don't have to look at it. I think&nbsp;there are other bluetooth issues are far deeper than that!

            Has anyone heard whether the Bluetooth always searching is still normal? Apparently by the fact it is still doing that search when in Settings, it must be normal. Or is it abnormal?

<h3> bradymoore  say:</h3>
<h2>            LARGE Cumbersom Item Icon When Dragging &#38; Dropping Items</h2>
                    <p>Im using Windows 7 Professional on my laptop and when I select a file (PDF, jpeg, etc) in a folder and drag and drop it to another folder a large icon appears that is cumbersome and gets in the way of the destination folder. For instance if I am moving a
 PDF a large PDF Icon comes up and I drag and drop it to the destination folder. The darn icon is so large that it makes it hard to see exactly where you want to drop it. I use Windows 7 on my desktop and when I do the same function there, a very small rectangle
 or folder icon is used, which makes it very easy to see where I am trying to drag and drop.</p>
<p>How do I turn off these big item icons and use the small on in Windows 7 Professional?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Touchpad right-click functionality changed after update</h2>
                    <p>My touchpad will now right-click if I am using my left index finger to navigate, and my right index finger to click, if I am clicking anywhere above the first 1/4th of the touchpad (if you divide it into horizontal rows). This is pretty annoying, and I used
 to be able to only right-click when I was clicking on the right-hand side of the touchpad. Is there any way to change this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The update may have caused changes to the settings of your touchpad. You may check the configuration of the touchpad of your Surface Pro 3 by going to
<strong>Start </strong>then click <strong>Settings </strong>and then choose <strong>
Devices</strong>. Under Devices, you should find <strong>Touchpad </strong>and that is the place where you can change the touchpad settings of the device. Please note that the touchpad settings can’t be changed in PC settings or using the Trackpad Settings
 app with the Type cover for the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Fable III has a black screen when the game restarts in the dressing room.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I loaded Fable III but the dressing room screen was black. I went to Nvidia and downloaded the most recent driver for Ge Force 7800 GTX. I have Windows 7 with an Intel dual core processor &amp; 4 GB of Ram. I reloaded Fable III but I still have a black screen
 when the game restarts in the dressing room. The internet shows my processor will run the game. How do I solve this black screen problem?<br />
Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Fable III is a graphically demanding game designed for next generation hardware. Your computer should have both a powerful CPU (processor), and graphics chipset (video card).
 The video card should also be using the latest video card drivers for the greatest level of performance and compatibility between Fable III and your computer hardware.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is the issue confined to
<strong>Fable III for PC?</strong> Are you facing any display issues other than when playing
<strong>Fable III for PC?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following link for more help on this:</span></p>

</p><p>What I would try at this point is remove the face login for Windows Hello, then have it set up from scratch again. Once the current face recognition is cleared and readded, see if your daughter can unlock the Surface.</p>

    <title>Xbox won&#39;t boot up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tempus glacia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox won&#39;t boot up</h2>
                    <p>So to start off, I would like to say that I was playing the system just fine not twenty minutes ago. Then I had to reboot my router and when the internet came back up to my console, all of a sudden things weren't acting right. First of all, the system was
 telling me that there was not enough room for one of my games to update - despite the fact that I have an external hard drive that still has 2.9 TB of space left open. Which prompted me to hard reboot the system, just to make sure that everything got situated
 correctly and see if that fixed whatever problem it was having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, NOW when the system comes on, it stays on the green Xbox screen for a ridiculously long amount of time, and when it finally DOES change to a new screen, it's just a blank, black one and it does nothing. I've tried hard rebooting it twice more and nothing
 has changed.</p>

<p>Hello Tempus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here on the Xbox forums. In this scenario, a soft factory reset usually does the trick. Please first attempt the power cycle steps provided by parity above. If the issue persists, try this out :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.
</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>BIND</strong> button (located below the Xbox button on the console Xbox one S and X), and then press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console.&nbsp;</li><li>Continue holding the <strong>BIND</strong> button for 10-15 seconds. </li><li>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the
<strong>BIND</strong> button after the second power-up tone.</li><li>The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>From this screen, select reset console<strong> (Reset and keep my games and apps)</strong>. Please note that you will have to redownload your account after this step. Make sure that you know the email/password for any accounts you use.</p>

<h3> joe_moore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cannot Reach Network Share</h2>
                    <p>I have a situation where a Win 10 PRO PC cannot access file share on a Win 7 PC. Prior to upgrading to Win 10 PRO this PC was Win 8.1 and could access the share in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC1: Win 7 Pro with shared drives A, C, not joined to a domain, homegroup OFF, WORKGROUP,
</p>
<p>PC2 Win 7 Pro, joined to a work domain that is it not on, homegroup OFF, </p>
<p>PC3 Win 10 Pro, shared drive C, not joined to a domain, homegroup OFF, WORKGROUP. I did a clean upgrade from Win 8.1 to Win 10 - initially I could mount PC1 A as a drive, but now I get a disconnected error,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All PCs are connected by a simple Telco router. Please take careful note: PRO version of all OSs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC1 - can access the files on PC3</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC2 - can access the files on both PC1 and PC3</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC3 - cannot access the files on PC1 (P2 has no shared files/drives). I get the error - MS Windows Network: Logon failure: the use had not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.&nbsp;
<strong>I'm </strong><strong>using the exact same credentials that I use on PC2 to gain access</strong>. One of the recent updates to Win 10 has created a logon problem. Prior to late December 2015 I could get see A,C on PC2 but there were intermittent problems.
 Since the last week no access at all.&nbsp; MS has been pushing a lot of updates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>PC3 - If I go to This PC &gt; Network I can still see the old mapped drive but everything is greyed out.&nbsp; It's like there is a cache or something that I can't get flushed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Dane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed their advise on this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. go to start search for &nbsp;</span><strong>Task Scheduler</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. (scheduled tasks)</span><br />
 Scheduler</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span><br />
 select&nbsp;</span><strong>Disable</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;and exit the task scheduler window and check if its is disabled or not.</span></p>
<p>Select disable on all off the options (only one you cannot edit, it is protected) after you will disable them select delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This helped me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after an update or some time, I noticed that the settings appeared back there. But maintenance did not start (I removed them again just to be sure :D )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try that and see if it works. Keep in mind one of these task cannot be removed and I suspect that this task will create the other ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

</p><p>On 1/12/16 (last night) I checked the Win 10 settings/updates screen.&nbsp; Screen said a cumulative update was waiting and a restart was required.&nbsp; I did not record the number of the update.&nbsp; I went into restart mode last night and am still waiting for it to
 finish rebooting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After several hours of reboot, it got to the hello screen once, I could not log in, but cntrl-alt-del gave me option to power down.&nbsp; Was able to click shutdown.&nbsp; It said it was configuring updates.&nbsp; After ~half an hour or so it finally shut down.&nbsp; Then I
 restarted manually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After an hour, it got to the greeting screen, but never let me log in.&nbsp; Then it went black.&nbsp; Hard drive light alternates on and off&nbsp; 5 sec on, 5 sec off.&nbsp; Got a mouse pointer showing on the screen.&nbsp; I can move the mouse pointer around the screen.&nbsp; Mouse
 buttons do nothing.&nbsp; Cntrl-Alt-Del does nothing.&nbsp; Keyboard does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Asus motherboard running a AMD processor.&nbsp; Processor drivers have been updated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Machine was originally running Win 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I "upgraded" to Win 10 in September.Win 10 seemed to be running OK before the re-start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Hard drive light is intermittently showing, I am unsure if I should shut it down with the power switch or if I should let it keep trying to find itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, though I have no Win 10 boot disk, I have my Win 7 disk.&nbsp; Can I use my Win 7 disc to reinstall that operating system?&nbsp; I'd rather not have to wipe the hard drive.&nbsp; "FORMAT C:" is such an ugly term.&nbsp;

<p>►Connections good. (of course they are.&nbsp; The system was fine until I did the restart.)</p>
<p>►Safe mode not accessible.&nbsp; (remember: system unresponsive)</p>
<p>►The only "external devices" are the mouse, keyboard, and speakers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked at the "Troubleshoot black screen problems" link.&nbsp; It contained those same suggestions.&nbsp; But it also had a link for making a boot disk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made a boot DVD disk. Got problems.trying to run it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Turned off computer,&nbsp; Started it and booted from DVD drive.</p>
<p>I get up to the place where it asks if I want to </p>
<p>■Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings and applications, </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>■Custom: Install Windows only , (which requires reinstalling all my programs and files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to not lose everything.&nbsp; I choose "Upgrade"</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there I get a large message that says I need to take the boot disk out of the DVD drive and boot from the hard drive.&nbsp; I do that.&nbsp; (I have to do that.&nbsp; There are no other options provided.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I take the disc out of the drive and turn off the computer.&nbsp; Then I turn it on.</p>
<p>AFter about 30 seconds the screen says, "PREPARING AUTOMATIC REPAIR.&nbsp; then the screen briefly flashes white and a screen appears labelled, "select keyboard layout."&nbsp; But it does not let me select anything.&nbsp; Mouse &amp; keyboard unresponsive.&nbsp; Cntrl-alt-del does
 nothing.&nbsp; It's locked up tight.&nbsp; All I can do is switch off the box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So: Do I have to select, "Custom: Install Windows only" and lose all my other files and software?&nbsp; That's as bad as "format C:"&nbsp; (I keep a walloping load of stuff on my computer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there something I am missing?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not helpful. </p>
<p>The link in your post leads to a screen that says it is for Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Does it apply to Win 10?&nbsp; (not to worry.&nbsp; It doesn't work anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you folks would read my posts before answering with cut and paste boilerplate responses.&nbsp; I asked specific questions and you ignored them.&nbsp; You also ignored the information I supplied about my current status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot log in</p>
<p>I cannot get to Safe Mode.</p>
<p>The machine freezes in the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>I already said that in my prior post.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one video output.&nbsp; My only peripherals are mouse, keyboard and speakers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Having made the Win 10 install disk, I am unable to run the "upgrade" option.&nbsp; The "Custom: Install Windows only" option warns of application and file deletions.&nbsp; See previous post for further explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run the "Custom: Install Windows only" option, what files will I lose?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>►Will only the Windows files and settings be deleted</p>
<p>►Will it extend to programs like MS Office?</p>
<p>►will it wipe the disc nuking everything including data files such as spreadsheets and photos?</p>

</p><p>Sorry folks.&nbsp; Even as a free upgrade, I find Win 10 unsuitable as an operating system for a desktop machine.&nbsp; Even if it were stable, I still would not run it.</p>

    <title>Upgrade multiple Windows 7 keys to Windows 10 on one machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crewerjimbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade multiple Windows 7 keys to Windows 10 on one machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have 3 computers with genuine Windows 7 OEM version. I use just one from them, because other computers are broken at this time. I'm going to repair them and I want to install clean Windows 10 - upgraded from genuine Windows 7.</p>
<p>Problem is, that I won't be able to make it till 29th of June 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<p>Can I take Windows 7 product keys from broken laptops and "upgrade" them using functional laptop with "Change product key" feature? After the "upgrade" I will put the right OEM product key back to the functional computer of course.</p>
<p>Will I have an opportunity to repair broken laptop on August and install clean Windows 10 with "upgraded" product key then?</p>
<p>Will it be OK with licence policy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for your answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>Win 10 handles key differently.&nbsp; The upgrade is tied to the motherboard so even if you were to change each OEM key to "entitle" it, the entitlement would only be for the machine it was entitled on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, if your dont upgrade the hardware to win 10 before July 29 you will have to pay to do it later.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

    <title>Corel X3 will not run in the version of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corel X3 will not run in the version of Windows</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Corel X3 on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to install Corel X3 on a new laptop with Windows 10 and get the lower right of screen message that it will not run in</p>
<p>this version of windows. I have another desktop that I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.0 that already had Corel X3 installed and running</p>
<p>and it works fine in Windows 10. I have tried compatability mode installations without success. I saw another reference to
</p>
<p>this problem on this community page but someone from Microsoft just suggested that the user turn off antivirus and do a clean boot.</p>
<p>That didn't work for the other guy so I haven't tried it. The other guy went back to Corel 8.1 which I could do but it seems
</p>
<p>counter-productive. Has anyone come up with a way to install X3 on Win 10? Virtual machine software might work but that is just one more cost.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Disk Defragmentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 7th dwarf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Disk Defragmentation</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I've run the Windows 7 Disk defragmentation tool and it's running for more than 30 hours. The HDD which should be defragmented is a 120 GB Maxtor PATA 100 MHz disk, with only 1 partition (NTFS).<br />
<br />
After the analysis it made the first passage - defragmentation, then went to first passage - coordination, then went to second passage - defragmentation, then went to second passage - coordination, third passage...<br />
<br />
Now it's in the fifth passage - defragmentation... <br />
<br />
I would like to know how many passages there are in this Windows 7 defrag tool? The passages are under course or what is it called in English.<br />
<br />
I'm using Win 7 in our own language, so the translations to English in this post might be wrong, but it still should be obvious enough to understand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            OK, the defragmentation is now done succesfully. To answer my question: It took 5 passages.
