<h2>            Various Problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been incurring a number of issues with windows 10 lately:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to boot &gt; 10 minutes</p>
<p>Wifi service not starting</p>
<p>Netlogon not starting</p>
<p>Firewall not starting</p>
<p>Cannot type into searchbar or security key for network</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run gpupdate / force and sfc /scannow and get no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these issues I resolve - but then at reboot they reoccur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed msconfig to start in safe mode and now its failing to boot at all (I get bitlocker key then a black screen with the rotating wheel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally I just get a black screen and a working mouse pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I can recover the laptop? Its an HP elitebook running 1809 of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These symptoms happened before - PC support swapped the harddrive and now are happening again (3 weeks later).&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Graham
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since you are facing multiple issues, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
<br />It appears your installation is corrupt or broken. A repair upgrade is the best option you can try to see if it resolves the issue. 
<br />

<p>I don't think this option is available to me - because windows never actually boots up - just the constant circling. I've looked at refresh and reset but not sure how these interact to bitlocker. Restore to save point didn't find anything to go back to.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Thanks for all of these - they were the types of fixes that I found - and did in fact resolve the issues - until I rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once rebooted - everything was back to broken and I had to redo all of the fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore went to msconfig and switched the laptop to start in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since then - its not got as far as Windows. I get the bitlocker screen, enter password and then a back screen with the rotating cycle. If I hit ESC quick enough I get to the HP screen (sure start) but I've not found an option yet that will actually
 get me back to windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd quite like it to just start with the issues again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I've tried getting into safe mode - in fact this is what appeared to make the issue get far worse - so that it doesn't boot anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to restart 3 times doesn't appear to bring me up a boot menu - but ESC does bring up the Startup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has:</p>
<p>
</p><p>continue boot</p>
<p>system info</p>
<p>system diagnostics</p>
<p>3rd party option ROM management</p>
<p>Start Intel CIRA&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boot Menu</p>
<p>BIOS Setup</p>
<p>System Restore&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Lanaguage</p>
<p>Update System and Supported Device Firmware</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many of these - to no avail. I've just clicked the last again and its doing a System BIOS update. I've done a harddrive check previously and managed to find options to reset and refresh the OS but neither seemed to work (I think I'll encounter
 bitlocker issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging in at all would be deemed a success.</p>

            You should restore/ reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files during reset. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled.

<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)

            After creating the recovery media, try performing a Startup repair.
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Repair your computer in the bottom left
<br />
<br />This will boot into the Recovery environment 
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Startup repair
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you perform a custom install and recover your files from Windows.old.

<h2>            Bought used computer with erased hard drive and no backup media.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently bought a used Hewlet-Packard computer at a hospital auction.&nbsp; Due to patient confidentiality rules and software EULAs, the hard drive was erased, including the operating system.&nbsp; No software media was included, but a "Windows 7 pro OA HP"
 key tag is on the&nbsp;cover.&nbsp; I knew&nbsp;of this before I put in a bid, but would I be able to download Windows online using the key number?&nbsp; The only other option I can think of is buy it at Wal Mart, but all I found was Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Vista Home Basic that came with the Dell I'm using now, but I've read other posts saying factory installed OS can't be used on another computer so transplanting hard drives may not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My keyboard, mouse, and monitor are from Dell, would they work with Hewlet-Packard?&nbsp; If I had to buy new peripherals I'm afraid this is going to wind up being a money pit and I'd be better off keeping what I have or buying a new computer that has the
 proper software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>If the computer contains a valid Windows 7 Pro product key on the sticker you can download the appropriate .ISO file and install Windows 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>==============================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the appropriate Windows 7 .ISO file which includes Service Pack 1<br />
(Note: must match what your product key version is for)</p>
<p><br />
How to find out if I have a 32 or 64Bit version of Windows installed on my computer:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHA1 Hash value: D89937DF3A9BC2EC1A1486195FD308CD3DADE928<br />
Windows 7 Professional 64Bit: <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59186.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><br />
<br />
1) After downloading the correct .iso file install HashCalc and validate the SHA1 hash value<br />
is correct. If the download is not corrupt, the value HashCalc returns will match the SHA1 value I posted.<br />

ImgBurn - In addition to supporting the creation of Cds/DVDs from .ISO files, <br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free. <br />

(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================== <strong>Keyless Install</strong> ================================</p>
<p><br />
How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to:<br />
'Type your Windows product key',&nbsp; do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark<br />
to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During the grace period you can install your device drivers, <br />
run Windows Updates and resolve any other problems or issues.<br />
Once you are satisfied everything is functioning properly, then activate Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================== <strong>Device Drivers</strong> ===============================</p>
<p><br />
Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p><br />
If there are Windows 7 drivers, then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, USB, Graphics, Webcam, Etc., and so on.</p>

    <title>ALPS set mouse monitor error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jono chen  say:</h3>
<h2>            ALPS set mouse monitor error</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an obsolete thread which were 2 post posted 1-2 years ago about the&nbsp;</p>
ALPS_set mouse monitor error!!
<p>
</p><p>People responded by running a 'Hardware and Devices' troubleshooting step which does not work anymore because Windows has removed it. The second one was the uninstall all the drivers and then to restart the computer, however this does not reset the laptop's
 original OEM trackpad drivers. People either still didn't get the issue resolved or no one replied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue was caused by accidently downloading Lenovo ALPS touchpad drivers from&nbsp;<a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/au/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/yoga-series/yoga-710-15isk/downloads/ds112960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/au/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/yoga-series/yoga-710-15isk/downloads/ds112960</a>&nbsp;by
 manually picking drivers to download, in this case the one that caused the issue was one called Apfiltr.inf in the driver package. I don't know how to revert back to the original drivers and make the trackpad work again. The trackpad has not worked since I
 downloaded these drivers. I've realised that the Device Manager contained three 'HID-Compliant Mouse' and after I downloaded the wrong faulty driver, only two are present. I believe it is the ALPS driver that is missing. However, the trackpad still does recognise
 whenever i place my finger, just can't move the mouse pointer or click on anything, because my keyboard backlight lights up when I place my finger on the trackpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply as soon as possible and provide the necessary information only to solve this issue. I have a School Dell Latitude 5280. Just want to get the trackpad working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been wondering if there is a way to download Windows precision drivers on an ALPS trackpad? Because this was how I got to this error, by trying to install what I thought was precision driver upgrades for ALPS trackpads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Jono</p>

            Hi Jono 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Try deleting all mouse configurations in device manager and reboot.
<br />To do that right click start button and go to device manager.
<br />Expand Mice and Other Pointing Devices then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver. 
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software and follow the on-screen instructions to update the drivers. 
<br />If no updates were found, then right-click on the mouse select Uninstall. 
<br />Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />See if that can get it going again.

<p>Hi Sarah, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said above, I have tried both of these of what you said before coming here and the trackpad still does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I view this may work again is that there should be three HID compliant mouse under mouse and other pointing devices but there is only two. Supposedly, the culprit I think, is the missing driver for the trackpad working functionality. There are two drivers
 for the trackpad and one for the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply ASAP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Jono</p>

            Seems the image has conflicting drivers possibly.
<br />Best course of  action which might seem extreme is to reset pc and keep files.
<br />You will need to reinstall apps but you won't lose data.
<br />I had to do this on my laptop a few months ago because my wifi stopped working and reset was the only thing that fixed it.
<br />To reset go to start - settings - update and security - recovery - get started on reset.
<br />Make sure to select reset and keep files.

<h2>            Dlc not working offline.</h2>
                    
<p>Lately i bought several dlc for a couple of different games and i dont have an internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But I took it to location with internet and downloaded them. They're in my games and apps on the xbox home screen when I manage my games. But when I go to play the game itself, the dlc don't show up. The games in wich I'm having trouble with are 'call of
 duty:flack ops 3' and 'fallout 4'. Please some one help me out here. I spent a ton on dlc and I can't even play it. If anyone has the same problem with xbox one let me know.</p>

<p>The DLC may need a patch for you to actually begin playing it just downloading the DLC may not work. Its very likely the only way you can play the DLC maps is by yourself and no other players with you without an actual internet connection"</p>
<p>"Additional storage, hardware and Xbox Live may be required for some setup, some updates, and features, including retention of some gamplay settings and information."</p>
<p>Another example is you may actually need to be connected to a paying XBL account. Best thing you can try is go where ever you downloaded it and use their internet to see if the maps show up at that point. You may have not been able to complete that download
 process.</p>

<p>I also looked it up and other games the solution was setting up your Xbox as the home xbox and actually syncing the data first.</p>
<p>Then I read some places in some games the license should be transferred to THAT xbox .</p>
<p>As well as a weird one says you must be 18 to use the DLC ? (which I know I said was weird.)</p>

<p>I did what I suggested in the link above and disconnected my router and went completely offline.</p>
<p>The maps were in my game options. Are you definitely sure you actually downloaded the maps and not have them just in your list ?</p>
<p>Some games you have to MANAGE the game on the console and actually INSTALL the maps after you download them.</p>

    <title>Issue with Direct Access with Outlook 2016 Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niallmacaulay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Direct Access with Outlook 2016 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, strange issue. This does not affect users on Window 8.1 only Windows 10. Basically when connected to direct access Outlook 2016 client can not connect. Internet works fine and so does access to company shares etc, its only clients like Sykpe and Outlook
 that have the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When both Win 8.1 and 10 are using direct access you get the yellow triangle or message saying no internet access, however as stated above internet works fine and on 8.1 the Outlook client works fine as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work around on the windows 10 machines is to access outlook via OWA but i would like to get it working properly. Off the top of my head im thinking Outlook sees that Windows is saying there is no network so doesn't even try to access the Office 365 server,
 i think if i could get rid of the no internet access error then it would work, however that doesn't explain why windows 8.1 works... OK&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I can post info from a log if you advise what section you would like to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Whistle sound from the hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akhil abraham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Whistle sound from the hard drive</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion dv6 laptop, and recently, when I did a hard disk error check, the hard drive started to produce a whistle-like sound. Also, the error check was unresponsive. So, I had no option, but to switch off the laptop directly. After switching
 it on, it showed that I had to install an operating system! I switched it off again, then later, switched it on. This time, it switched on normally. But, I would like to know if any precautions are to be taken, since the sound that came from the laptop earlier
 is worrying me. I would like if all this is normal or dangerous.

<p><span>The issue might occur if the hard drive is not connected properly. I would suggest you to make sure all
 the hardware is connected and working correctly. You may also refer to the article for hardware diagnostics:</span></p>

The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more public approach to testing Windows pre-release version in comparison to previous releases under development, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.

            <p><em><strong>I am presuming you mean that your system had Windows 7 on it and your husband "upgraded" it to Windows 10.&nbsp; You want Windows 7 back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a valid usable Microsoft Windows 7 product key to activate your installation.&nbsp; If your system came with Windows 7, it should be usable on a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the system rejects it on first attempt to activate, click the phone option and go through
 that procedure.&nbsp; Explain to the Microsoft rep what has happened and they will likely give you a one-time special activation code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you "reverted" your system to Windows 7, you may have a number of problems.&nbsp; Did you re-install Windows 7?&nbsp; If not, here are the instructions on how to do that:</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Win10 back to Win7</em></strong>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit versions) KB3083710, &nbsp;KB3102810, and KB3161608 in advance, and store on a USB stick,&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; When you search for the&nbsp; 64 bit versions of these KB’s specify 64 bit.&nbsp; The 32 bit versions do not say which
 version they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3161608 and restart</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a
 precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html</span></a></p>
<p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>

<p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove all of Microsoft’s spyware that is&nbsp;already installed&nbsp;on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time. You need to wait till you see the number at the bottom of the search window exceed a few hundred.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed (the number at the bottom again exceeds several hundred), enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p><em>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>

            <p>Yea it's not great for sure </p>
<p>Not sure about the prior instructions some of the updates to manually install are a lot different than mine
</p>
<p>You might look into this it is the newest way to update after a clean install,</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is planned by M$ we must now jump through hoops to clean install,</p>
<p>This is an older way but still works just check out some of the last comments for newer KB#'s to install manually instead use these in this order</p>

            I fixed the problem by creating a new account, giving that account admin privileges, then deleting my old account.&nbsp; That also involved reinstalling apps, readjusting settings, etc. Fortunately, I did not have many docs, pics, etc. on my old account.&nbsp; It
 was a pain, but creating a new account made apps functional again.

            Hi Fuad.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. 
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            <pre>Attach an external storage device – if you have an external hard disk or USB thumb drive with a minimum 10 Gbs of free space, you can utilize it to facilitate the installation. Windows 10 setup will maximize the drive to store, archive and move around temporary files during installation. If you already have files on the drive, no need to worry, they will not be deleted; Windows 10 will move files to a folder on the drive called Windows.old. If in the near future, you decide you need to go back to your previous version, you will need to utilize the drive to restore it.
 After connecting on an external hard disk or USB thumb drive, click the refresh button or click in the list box then select the attached storage device. Thats it, click Continue to begin the installation. Please note, setup can take longer to complete if you are using a mechanical drive. Using a flash drive might be faster.
Remember, if you do decide to go back to your previous version of Windows, you must attach the external storage device in order to facilitate the rollback.
Check out our previous article to learn more about using this feature if you are currently attempting to upgrade to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.
If you are updating through Windows Update
If you experience a limited space issue through Windows Update while updating to Windows 10 1703, an error message will appear with the option to Fix issue. Click the 'Fix issue' button; this will start a wizard to help you facilitate the upgrade using an external storage device. Click the link I want to use external storage instead
Connect your external hard disk, then click in the second list box, choose your external hard disk.
Click the Refresh button to make sure that it is detected then click Continue.
Click the close button, Windows Update will pick up from where it left off then continue with the installation.
Click Restart when prompted to continue with the installation, do not disconnect the external hard disk.

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            open tray</h2>
                    
<p>I read the previous answer to the question about the open tray message, and I a novice to electronics. Sometimes I can open and close the tray several times and then it will work.&nbsp;So my question is if using a laser cleaning device in the xbox360 might eleviate
 this problem?</p>

<p>Mind you any use of unauthorized materials with your XBOX 360 could void any warranty you have with your XBOX 360, even if there is no warranty and you choose to pay the repair cost of $99 you won't be able to do that anymore if you were to open the console
 or use unauthorized methods of fixing the console yourself. Just a heads up.</p>

            Hi fawadkhattak1 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your PC and keyboard?
<br />Try running the troubleshooter.
<br />Go to search and type troubleshoot and open it.
<br />Select Keyboard and run that.
