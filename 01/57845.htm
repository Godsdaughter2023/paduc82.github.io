<h2>            Surface Pro 3 &#38; 4 External Display</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet far and wide and I am having issues with several issues at the company that I work for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been issuing Surface Pro 3 &amp; 4's (Mainly 4 now) and we are using the docking station. Now when connected to an external display the text along toolbars (in adobe or outlook &amp; more) are absolutely huge!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text is also fuzzy and no matter how much I mess around with the resolution and other settings I can't get it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, I have tried this with different monitors, different versions of Windows and different docking stations. We are using the mini display port to display port method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have messed around with the settings so much and I can't figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else come across this &amp; did they ever figure it out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>btw - what you're looking at,&nbsp;appears to me to be the Dock outputting the wrong resolution your monitor.&nbsp; The web page Content looks OK because it is manually scalable. But the fixed page elements, like address bar, margins, tabs, etc. are&nbsp;defined in&nbsp;absolute
 pixels and showing up at probably half of your monitor's native resolution.&nbsp; (Which is better than I can get out of the Dock - I can't get anything). You can see more in this thread I started re: Dock problems:</p>

<h2>            Already activated windows 7 randomly asks for reactivation and then gives an error&#33; abit odd</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, At around 6 am on 03/01/2011 I've got an error saying "the product key must be activated with new hardware" well last time I've upgraded my hardware was three month ago which I did a clean install and activated windows and all the sudden I've got this
 random error, I dont know what caused it but now every time I try to reactivate it online it gives me these option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a new product key online </li><li>Retype your product key </li><li>Use the automate phone system to activate </li><li>Contact Microsoft to help resolve this problem </li></ul>
<p>But what I dont understand is why do I need to buy a new key when mine worked fine until now and now it started being annoying and isnt the phone option for OEM, I mean I have a retail version of Microsoft 7 ultimate which I bought back in 2009 I have the
 copy of the bill and everything, If you'll need proof I'll give you proof but please hurry up with help because that has given me 3 day.</p>
<p>I've also rolled back my PC to 2 days ago just incase something has updated it self but I still get this error, I am pretty good with computers but this error dont really giving me much option to work with here...</p>
<p>My spec just incase if you wondering and if it helps in anyway</p>
<p>OS: windows 7 ultimate 64-bit (6.1, built 7600)</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD5</p>
<p>CPU:intel&nbsp; i7 980x</p>
<p>GPU: 2x Nvidia GTX480 SLI</p>
<p>6GB of corsair</p>
<p>and windows is installed on a 500GB HDD seagate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>From what I see, you have the wrong browser settings to get useful results from MGADiag.exe. You must change the following settings from "Disabled" to "Allowed":</p>
<p>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins<br />
Active scripting<br />
Script ActiveX controls marked as safe for scripting</p>
<p>Unchanged, you will always get errors like&nbsp;0x80072EE7&nbsp;(ERROR_INTERNET_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED) because no activation server can be found. As this is a DNS error, you can also have a look at<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883821</a>,
 even if&nbsp;your issue isn't Windows Update related (the "connection to server" problem is the same).</p>

<p><span>Hi tidwc</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask a few questions to help focus in the right direction:</span></p>
<p><span>Are there any other specific details that you can provide that will help us to understand and resolve your issue?
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Since when are you receiving this error?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Did you make any changes to your system?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when tries to use the external HD &amp; DV recorder?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you getting a good quality video when you try to view in the camcorder itself?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which is the program are you using on Vista to transfer the video? Try importing using Movie maker and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Disable filters in movie maker and check. Refer to this link:
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Restore-default-Windows-Movie-Maker-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Restore-default-Windows-Movie-Maker-settings</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Remove all other third party video editing softwareâs and check. Refer to the above link.
</span></p>
<p><span>Also follow the steps in the link and verify in movie maker if it works fine
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Import-video-from-a-videotape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Import-video-from-a-videotape</span></a>,
</span></p>
<p><span>This problem occurs if the camera uses the Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) standard to transfer pictures to the computer.
 Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 use the Windows Portable Devices (WPD) standard instead of the WIA standard to import pictures and videos. The WPD standard supports many devices and device connectivity options.<br />
<br />
To work around, check out the below article:<br />
<br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927836</span></a><span><br />
<br />
Most video cameras come with a Digital Video (DV) output that connects your video camera to your computer via a Firewire connection.&nbsp; Windows Vista comes with everything you need to import (or capture) video on your computer, edit the video, and burn it on
 DVD.<br />
<br />
Check if the Camcorder is compatible with Vista:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Default.aspx?type=Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Default.aspx?type=Hardware</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Connect Your Camcorder:</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong><span>What you need:</span></strong>&nbsp; In order for you to connect your video camera to the computer you need a video camera with a DV output (usually a Firewire connection), a firewire cable to connect the
 video camera to your computer, and a Firewire port or card on your computer.<br />
<br />
Make sure your Camcorder is turned off first.<br />
<br />
Connect the camera via a Firewire cable to your computer.<br />
<br />
Once the Camcorder is connected to your computer, turn the Camcorder on.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Make sure the Camcorder is turned on with the player selected instead of the recorder.&nbsp; The DV output will only activate if the player is selected on most video camcorders<br />
<br />

<p>I just recently also purchased a new computer, with Windows 10 and media player installed of course, my OLD computer could burn cd's, same program, this one just spits the discs out!&nbsp; I spoke with both Hewlett Packard and MS, my computer is only two weeks
 old, and even they couldn't manage to help me with this issue.&nbsp; Somebody suggested I try iTunes, which I did, transferred my music files over, and then went to burn a cd from a "playlist", again, disc is ejected with numerous messages, like Attempt to burn
 a disc failed - no kidding! and E:\Directory name is invalid, one also stating something about formatting the disc, and that I didn't have the correct permission to do that, etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; HELP!&nbsp; I bought this assuming I would still be able to burn CD's here,
 and yet that's not happening.&nbsp; Windows Media Player seemed to be trying to hijack iTunes at one point so I merely uninstalled it.&nbsp; Still can't burn cd's. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Party&#47;mic issues</h2>
                    Many people that are in a party with me can hear literally every bit of audio that I can hear including themselves. I use headphones and i've tried every readily available option (or at least as far as im aware) to remove this issue but it still persists.

<p>As I understand you are experiencing echo issues with your party. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, please make sure that you are using the boom mic with the headset. &nbsp;Using the internal mic can cause an echo issue at higher volumes with Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If people in your party are complaining about hearing their voice echo back or strange squawk type noises, first try adjusting your "Headset Volume" in the Xbox Guide down one notch from maximum.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If <strong>
you</strong> hear everyone else in your party echo when in party chat, it is likely due to the Xbox One being set to output party chat audio to both speakers and the headset at the same time. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To change this setting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>All</strong> <strong>
Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Display &amp; sound</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Volume</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Party chat output</strong></li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Headset</strong></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You should no longer hear the echo. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

            Also try another headset and see if the problem persist.&nbsp; I have had this happen to me in the past and the headset I was using had a bad connection in the headset itself causing a cross-talk issue where the audio was feeding back into the mic.&nbsp;

<p>Assuming your issue isn't directly related to a NAT issue, let see if we can help fix this issue.<br />
<br />
If you're using a wireless headset that uses the same technology the Xbox controllers use to connect:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">As silly as it sounds I've fixed not only this issue but also not hearing anybody in party nor game sounds by rebooting the headset and updating both the controller and headset's firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a wired headset in the 3.5 mm jack:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Check your headset to make sure the wires are not frayed or noticeably damaged. Again as above, double check your controller's firmware is updated by using the Xbox Accessories app and plugging it in to the console via USB. While
 not strictly necessary it makes sure your controller will not shut off during the fireware update, should one be required. Also make sure to keep your controllers batteries as close to full as possible as this too will provide the most power for both the headset
 and controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps and happy gaming.</p>

<p>I am assuming that you have both game and party chat Coming through the headset and not TV speakers. Some mics even on a boom are extremely sensitive and will pick up even sound from the headset. If your mic is flexible, try to bend it further away from
 the ear pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which headset are you using?</p>

            Check your volume/audio settings if they are at max turn then all down 1 notch. turn mic monitoring to lowest. i sometimes find that you can run into some party problems when batteries are running low on power and some plug and play kits seem to cause
 some problems while using some headsets. just a couple of things to think about.&nbsp;

<p><span><span><strong><span>Hi
 asank,</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><br />
1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. What changes have been done prior to the issue?</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Method
 1: </span></strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
<strong><span>You may disable and then enable</span></strong><strong><span>Windows Media Player</span></strong><strong><span>on
 expanding Media features from the Windows on or off features option and check if this resolves the issue. You will have to disable the feature then click ok. Now open
</span></strong><strong><span>Windows Media Player</span></strong><strong><span>and check. Again you may enable the</span></strong><strong><span>Windows
 Media Player</span></strong><strong><span> and check if you face the same issue.</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Refer the below link to view the window
 for disabling and enabling windows media player - </span></strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to use the below mentioned links and use the troubleshooters present with Media
 Player and check if it lists any issues â<br />

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Method
 3:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You
 may perform a SFC scan and check. <br />
<strong>To</strong> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Perform
 a SFC Scan</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;-<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>All Programs</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click&nbsp;
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click &nbsp;<strong>Allow<br />
</strong><span>b. </span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp; </strong><br />
A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time.<br />
c. If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue.<br />
d. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".<br />
e. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for
 further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

    <title>Is this normal or do I have a defective Surface Pro 4&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathansloan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is this normal or do I have a defective Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just got my surface pro 4 and I'm delighted with the design and the concept, but it is SOOOOOOO buggy that I'm wondering if I'm going to have to return it. I've had it for about a week and not a single day of use goes by without several problems. Here
 is a list of what I've experienced so far:</p>
<p>1) Type cover caps lock key reversed (when the light was on I typed lowercase, off and it typed caps). When it did this it also wouldn't allow me to use any of the number keys, I could get the symbols on the number keys, but no numbers.</p>
<p>2) Type cover track pad randomly stops working. The keys work fine, but there is no response when I try to use the track pad - and no, I wasn't in tablet mode. This has happened a couple of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) IR light next to cameras comes on and just stays on. Glowing red while I continue doing regular PC things on my Surface. It's like it just never shuts off after "hello" sign in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Windows Hello screen says "Looking for you" with the little eyeball animation but the red IR light isn't on so it isn't actually looking for me! I can hold it at any angle but it won't see me so I have to revert to using my password. Very often, shutting
 it down and restarting it again doesn't fix this issue. Randomly it will decide to start working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Waking from sleep is terrible. If I put it to sleep by hitting the lock button it seems to do better, but if I just close the type cover and it goes to sleep - boy howdy. It can take upwards of a minute for the screen to come on. Sometimes I get the black
 screen with Surface logo as if it has shut down and rebooted.</p>
<p>6) When it does come on it does so very "glitchy." What I mean by that is I'll be staring at a black screen for a while then it will quickly show me the sign on screen and jump right to the desktop like it had already happened and just forgot to show me.
 Don't know if that makes any sense. It's like it sits black for &nbsp;while and then fast forwards through the visuals for the sign on process. I think about 30% of the time sign in happens smoothly.</p>
<p>7)Clicking pen button once brings up One Note, then I can get NO pen input by drawing with the pen tip. No weird settings, I wasn't accidentally on eraser. It's just like the tip was dead. No hover animation or anything. Restarting fixed this issue and it
 only has happened once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all of these issues I have been restarting the computer to try and resolve them. Most of the time a restart works, but it's just a matter of time before something else starts misbehaving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been using Macs for the past 10 years so maybe I've just been spoiled - is this the way all windows PCs act? Are these just software or firmware glitches that Microsoft is aware of and developing patches for? Are these hardware issues and if so do I
 need to send it in for repair or replacement? Just want to see if this experience is normal for Surface Pro 4 owners. If there is not a better experience than this for me to look forward to I will have to regrettably return it for a refund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I would suggest returning it for replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had almost all of the same problems you have, in addition to my pen not working at all. When I took the machine back to BestBuy, they wouldn't exchange the pen only. I had to exchange the whole SP4 as well. I thought that was stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I didn't have much installed on the SP4, so I erased it and got a whole new unit as a replacement. My pen works great now and&nbsp;most of the problems with my SP4 went away with it. It seems my SP4 might have been defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have switched from iPad to SP4 and have not yet sold my iPad Air until I get through the evaluation period. I love the SP4 when it works well as it does right at the moment. It seems that all of the above problems have been fixed except with slow wakeup,
 but there is a work around for that at the following post:</p>

            <p>1) Not normal.</p>
<p>2) Not normal.</p>
<p>3) Not normal.</p>
<p>4) Not normal.</p>
<p>5) Lots of people have this. Software issue. Will get fixed.</p>
<p>6 ) Related to 5.</p>
<p>7) Can happen if Bluetooth was turned of and reactivated. Unpair, pair and restart fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion : Perform a full refresh. If it does not fixes point 1 to 4, have the device replaced. You paid for a fully working product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            5-7 are definitely normal. I am experiencing what you described in 2 also, I think it is a software issue that will hopefully be fixed.

            <p>I received my Surface Pro 4 a couple of weeks ago and have experienced 2 + 5 and other problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Boot time after hibernation is 2.5 min.! Putting it into sleep drains the battery (common error that is supposed to be fixed), so I made it automatically go into hibernation when I close the lid. However, I don't know what's worse - to wait 2,5 min for
 the surface to boot or loose battery when not used...</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Same problem with track pad as you mentioned in no. 2. It happens mostly when going from tablet mode (with the keyboard still attached but folded behind the screen) to normal mode again with keyboard in front. Problem is usually solved by disengaging
 the keyboard and attaching it again - but REALLY not acceptable to pay so much for a keyboard that doesn't work smoothly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) Scrolling function on the keyboard trackpad sometimes stop working randomly or in situations as above. The keyboard works but scrolling doesn't... The scrolling is bad as it is (not smooth at all and way behind any Apple product) so this is just unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) Microsoft Edge browser causes the screen to glitch and sometimes turn black! Only Edge causing the problem. When scrolling on Edge the screen changes color at specific points while the screen flickers - scrolling up and down on that point makes the color
 go back and forth. Once, the screen went all black. The surface was still on and clicking on the far right buttom corner made me able to exit Edge and go to the Desktop. Going back into Edge meant the screen went black again... So had to exit Edge and I'm
 not using the browser anymore...</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) A more graphic fault is that when I enter my pin at the start page the screen flickers shortly and the pin box bounces once. The system always starts but it is an annoying "feature" that happens each time I boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I remember right now. I feel that I've forgotten many more bugs...</p>

            <p>Thank you for the responses. I do believe that the keyboard errors occurred after I had it in tablet mode with the keyboard on reverse and flipped backward. Maybe I'll just stop doing that, even though I should be able to. I really don't understand what
 causes the windows hello issues but maybe I'll test it out without monkeying around with the keyboard for a while and see how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I FORGOT ONE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I wake it up from sleep or restart it I have to reconnect to my WiFi router manually even though I have the "Connect automatically' box checked. Read something about this being a driver error? How do I fix a driver error?</p>

            <p>Oh, and light internet browsing use is seeing the battery drain at a rate of just over 10% every 30 minutes. This would give me a practical battery life of 4 hours and a little change. Is that what most people are noticing?</p>

            <p>It seems though, that the ads infest Edge badly and result in the bad battery usage, since the ads are constantly updated, forcing the internet connection to be a lot more active than one would think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Adblock for edge can remove ads from Edge and possibly cut down battery usage. I've found it cuts down processing power so it will probably work on battery as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>adblock can be found at edgeadblock.com</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing your concern in the Surface community. We are sorry about the troubles. Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot the screen glitches and let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down the power button, then perform a two button shutdown if holding down the power button doesnât resolve the issue then proceed with the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds. </li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. Once the Surface is back on, run Windows Update.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi AnuragSinghas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be something on the background that might be hindering the update you're performing on your
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. For me to have a better idea on what troubleshooting, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Just to clarify, are you getting the same error message when performing the update on a different user profile?</li><li>How are you getting the update for your Windows, is it through the <strong>Windows Update</strong> from the
<strong>Settings</strong> or is it through the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a></strong>website?</li><li>Is this the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> that you've used?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can use these steps as reference in performing the update by click the link on
<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQPhpKng5Cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/eQPhpKng5Cc?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/eQPhpKng5Cc?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></strong>.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I understand that Windows updates failed to install, you get the error: "WindowsUpdate_800B0100" and "WindowsUpdate_dt000". This error will occur when the file needed by
<span>Windows</span> Update isn't registered with <span>Windows</span> correctly.<br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<b><span>&nbsp;</span>Letâs disable antivirus software temporarily and install the updates.</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer to this link: </span></b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

            Method 3 was able to fix &nbsp;error code <b>WindowsUpdate_dt000.</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>
<span>Error code </span>WindowsUpdate_800B0100 <span>
&nbsp;still persists.</span>
<div>I ran the latest System Update Readiness tool, as well as the M$ Fix IT download.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fix It claimed to solve the<b>&nbsp;</b><span><b>WindowsUpdate_800B0100</b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>error code, but that is a lie.</span></div>
<div><span>The <b>SURT</b> program had run 'successfuly'. not coming up with any notifications other than 'completed' with the option to close. So I must assume it did its thing.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>After several restarts and clean boots, and running the programs, nothing helped alleviate this error.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font>I noticed that the pc had the update icon near its shutdown button, so I allowed it to do the updates on shutdown. After installing 2/2 updates&nbsp;</font>successfully<font>&nbsp;on shutdown, I tried the update wizard again. This showed
 that the 2 installed were security updates, and the SP1 was once again not installed. Attempting to install va the wizard popped the icon back on the shutdown button, So I tried that. Once again, to no avail.</font></div>
<div><font>Upon checking the Update Wizard it seemed, at first, that everything installed correctly, the SP1 and 2 security updates vanished from the update page. I gave it a minute of just idling on that page, and they miraculously reappeared, despite
 being 'successful' on the shutdown sequence. I checked update history, and it said 'failed' once again (my update history is now about 200 lines of failed updates, with only the KB976932 - SURT tool being the 'successful' updates.)</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>Going to do a safe-mode boot and see if that helps, but I doubt it given the past 2 months of not being able to update.&nbsp;</font></div>

<span><br />
You may perform In-Place upgrade (repair install) and check. <br />
</span><span><br />
Detailed steps are suggested in the following link.</span> <b><span><br />
How to Perform an In-Place Upgrade on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 &amp; Windows Server 2008 R2</span>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><span> Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information,

    <title>Windows 7 does not detect multiple External Hard Drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not detect multiple External Hard Drives</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a HP Pavilion laptop Winndows 7 Home Premium. I have two 500 GB external Hard Drives. When I connect them individually to the system, they are recognized and I can copy files from/to to these external Drives. But when I try to
 connect both at the same time, Windows 7 does not detect the drive I connect second. Any help is greatly appreciated.
                </div>

If you are still having the problem detecting the 2nd external hard drive, then I would like to share with you that I have also experienced the same problem when I tried to connect 3 external Seagates 500Gigs each, and each of the HDs with their own power supply.<br />
<br />
I would like to also share with you, if you are still having the&nbsp;problem, that I have been able to connect and my Windows 7 Pro has been able to detect all 3 external HDs and each drive has its own letter assigned to it.<br />
<br />
Each external drive (ED)&nbsp;is accessible like if nothing ever happened.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be a conflict of IDs assigned to each&nbsp;(ED)&nbsp;when we connect an (ED), then when we connect a 2nd (ED), then the 2nd (ED) is trying to use an ID that has already been assigned to the 1st (ED), therefore, the 2nd (ED) stays "offline" to avoid
 a conflict with the 1st (ED).<br />
<br />
The technical term is "The disk is offline because it has a signature collision with another disk that is online"<br />
<br />
To make the 2nd and 3rd, and 4th (ED) to be online, then you have to go to:<br />
<br />
- Computer Management<br />
- Disk Management<br />
- Scroll down so you can see your external drives<br />
- You will notice that the 1st (ED) is "Online"<br />
- You will notice that the other (EDs) are "Offline"<br />
- Right-Click on "Offline" and a shortcut menu will give the option to turn (ED) "Online"<br />
- Wait for a few seconds and now that (ED) will become available to be used.<br />
<br />
I hope these findings will help you guys minimize your frustrations as I had them before I found this solution.<br />

            If the drives are powered by the USB bus and do not have their own external power supplies the problem is&nbsp;that the laptop is not supplying sufficient USB power to drive both.<br />
<br />
The USB specification is that each port should supply 500mA at 5V. To conserve their batteries, laptops usually provide 500mA to be shared between all the available ports. If you need to use several USB devices with significant power requirements you need either
 an external powered USB hub or to provide the devices with their own power supplies.

<p>
</p><p>I am talking about MS Windows 10 Edge browser only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary problems&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>Tthe Font Size &nbsp;[the default is too small for my reading] </p>
<p>And may be style also [I normaly like Times New Roman]</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched in the internet many said go look for a section in the settings that you get when you click on the three dots on the upper right hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They referred a section&nbsp;..Reading...that is above the... Advanced Settings...section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I see in my Edge browser [No reading section] is different from what they have showed in a picture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell how to adjust the Font and Style in the edge browser.</p>
<p>

<p>No sync is no Sync is mean you dont get notfications or update the messanges when somebody post with out first open the app and manuell sync it with draw finger frome top and down for refresh the app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But if you have the standard Skype app you get it, but if you only run Preview app and not the basic Skype is just stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Messanges for me show up on both devices.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But the Preview app dosent make notfication when app is closed need to open the app for the messanges to reload into the app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is not like the basic Skype app where you get notfication both into the phone and the PC and messanges is there and can also read messanges notfication frome app notfication center.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But i dont have that probs you talk about anymore hade it when skype was in P2P old clients version where you was need to add same contact in every device and echo messanges only show in that device you write and recived at, but that has ben removed for me
 now i have crosssync.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But the sync and notfication one the Preview app is not like the basic app preview app am relly need to open the whole app for see messanges and no sound with make it very hard to know that man get a messanges when you not close to the pc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your quotes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I finally found a solution, by linking my email and skype accounts together... I didn't want to do so at first because if you have a problem with your email account then you can still use your skype account...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, skype sync is working well now.</p>

                    Program is open and running but I cannot access its operations window. &nbsp;If I had a functioning monitor to the left of my main monitor, that's where the program would be. &nbsp;I know there is a simple solution but I cannot remember it.

    <title>Completely locked out of my computer thanks to Screen Time settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Completely locked out of my computer thanks to Screen Time settings</h2>
                    <p>I am completely locked out of one of the three computers in my home that uses the "screen time" settings of MS Family Security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three computers use the same account, and when I disabled screen time two of them worked fine. However, this third one tells me there are still restrictions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled screen time on these computers before and it has worked fine, but not this time for some reason. Multiple reboots and tinkering with the screen time settings have no affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the computer that is not working ONLY has that one child account, so I now have no access to it at all. I may have to re-install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I see that even disabling the screen timing under family safety, you're still not able to access&nbsp;one PC. Suggest you
 to test this issue by setting up the screen timing again to see if works fine. I mean, go online using Microsoft account, navigate to Screen time settings and set the time unlimited for all days for that particular account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now reboot all your PC's and then try to login with the problematic PC to see if it allows you to login.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted the outcome.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following (completely tuning off the computer after each action):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Turning off and on screen time (many times)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Setting all times to unlimited</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Removing the account completely from the Family, and adding it again</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Requesting more time (the button that appears when I receive this message)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Disconnecting the internet and reconnecting it</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Disconnecting the hard internet wire and trying wireless</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Waiting 2-3 days and doing all of the above again</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the computer is absolutely convinced screen time is still on, even though it is clearly off (and works fine on two other computers).</p>

            I had this EXACT problem. &nbsp; But luckily the logon screen said my son could log back in at 7:00am 3 days later. &nbsp;When I was able to log into his account, I found the problem. &nbsp;It was his outlook email account. &nbsp;The program kept saying that there was a problem
 and it needed to be fixed. &nbsp;I hit the fix button, but the computer said that there was a problem and I had to remove the email account and set up his outlook account again. &nbsp;Luckily I just had to change the password on his account and once I did, outlook and
 Microsoft family starting communicating again. &nbsp;The computer was recognizing my changes to the MS Family time settings, and was actually sending my personal email the requests for more time. &nbsp;I don't know if I would have been able to fix this if I was not
 able to log in eventually. &nbsp; But now that I know what the problem is, I will login in safe mode and fix the email. &nbsp;I hope this helps someone else out.

<h2>            Windows 10 CIM server connection error.  How to solve the error which does not allow to connect internet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I solved the problem to start Windows 10 afer numerous attemps and using USB Windows 10 both bits installer, but when I try to make internet connection I get answer no hardware connection. I checked status by configip/all on cmd and the internet is in place.
 IP routing is disabled. There are also problems with sound configuration. So I went to device manager I looked in help how to connect to internet. In Microsoft Management Console/Contents/Get Connected/ there is Connecting to the Internet procedure. I will
 go through it step by step if not there is no other option like to reinstall Window s10 package. &nbsp;So I followed connection description and first command get logical error explanation:</p>
<p>Get connected/Verify and repair network adapters C:&gt;Get-NetAdapter. t-NetAdapter: Cannot connect to CIM server error. The service be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.So I search google Windows
 10 connect to CIM server error.<br />
</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2723674/<br />
<br />
After you start the client connector on client computer, you may receive the following error message: Cannot connect the computer to the server because either another software installation is in progress or, the computer has a restart pending.<br />
Either complete the installation process, or, restart the computer and try to connect it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Registry Editor/Session Manager there are is&nbsp;<span>PendingFileRenameOperations&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to
 delete. How to proceed in Windows 10 to correct CIM server connection error?</p>
