<h2>            Apps Won&#39;t Open and Phantom Clicks in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>From the beginning, I've had problems with my version of Windows 10 (build 10240). Whenever I power on my laptop (a two year old Lenovo ThinkPad) I get a bunch of popup error messages. I don't know if any of those are relevant to my problem or not, but they
 basically say that Energy Management and MuteSync have stopped working, as well as about two additional popups each in foreign characters. I have a screenshot I can upload, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot open any of my apps. Any of them. The Start menu closes and the little wheel cursor comes up, like it's loading, and then nothing happens. Like it got halfway through loading the app, then changed its mind. This is true of any app -- anything from
 the App Store to Photos to Calculator. Unfortunately, this also includes Settings, or I would have simply reverted back to Windows 7. Interestingly enough, I can use the Control Panel just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to get into anything "the back way" (i.e., searching for it on my computer and then clicking on it from there; for example, "Manage Your Account") it comes up with another error popup. This one says "RuntimeBroker.exe Element not found." I can also
 get a screenshot of this, if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also been, more and more often, having a problem with phantom clicks. Every four and a half seconds, like clockwork, my "working in background" cursor starts spinning, and any windows I have open go grey, like I've clicked off of them. If I'm typing,
 it pauses for a moment, then resumes. (I've learned to time my typing around those pauses; I'm a bit of a speed demon when it comes to typing, so if I don't, I don't always catch that it hasn't registered four or five letters in there.) If I'm typing something
 into the address bar, it pauses, then highlights the entire bar, like it does when you click on it. Any fullscreened videos (like on Netflix) get taken out of fullscreen. I cannot tell you just how annoying this is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Settings do not work, I can't just revert back to Windows 7. Nor can I download any updates, with possible fixes. Nor can I do anything with any user accounts. Nor can I do anything through the Store to repair any broken apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've opened up the CMD window and ran these commands: "dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth" and "sfc /scannnow". I've set the priority for RuntimeBroker.exe to high. I manually uninstalled and reinstalled all the apps I could through the PowerShell
 (using the "Get-AppxPackage *appname* | Remove-AppxPackage" command). I typed the following command into PowerShell: "Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}" (it told
 me that it "Cannot bind parameter 'RemainingScripts'. Cannot convert the "Get-AppXPackage" value of type "System.String" to type "System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock".") Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to keep Windows 10, as it seems to be a really solid system. However, if the bugs cannot be fixed, I would just love to find out how to revert back to Windows 7 without being able to do it the "official" way through Settings. Suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Foxy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am sorry to know that you are facing this issues.</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have tried. I'll be glad to&nbsp;assist you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Try to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows
 from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span><span>: </span></span><span>I would suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check if it helps. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications/drivers
 or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>After clean boot troubleshooting steps, follow the section
</span><strong><span>"How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</span></strong><span> in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Run SFC/SCANNOW </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Left click on <strong>Start</strong> button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Admin) option which will let you run
<strong>'Run as administrator</strong>’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Command Prompt Window pops up.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;/SCANNOW and hit Enter.</span></p>

                    When I plug in my Nook color it's not recognized and is shown as unknown&nbsp; USB device. I tried updating the driver but I got a failure note for installation: HID non-user Input Data Filter (KB 911895). What can I do next?

            <p>Hello Mcmay0460,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you try connecting the device on a different computer and check?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the other USB device get recognize on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Device Manager and disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent
 the USB ports in Device Manager. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then click
<b>Run</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>devmgmt.msc</b> and press
<b>enter</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right-click</b> the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Repeat step “c” for each USB controller that is listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

<h2>            Missing chat history</h2>
                    I received an update on my gmail saying you should update the Skype version you have on your pc as the previous ones are going to be obsolete. Upon updating i saw that a chat history i had with someone important ,2 years ago is completely missing right
 now. Just a couple months ago ,the last time i used skype there was no such&nbsp; issue.&nbsp; But&nbsp; now the only remaining chat is a missed call i had with them,with the remaining texts all being blank. What can be done to remedy this?&nbsp;<br />

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

<p>Does sending feedback even help? I have seen on facebook and all when my associates&nbsp; had issues ,they essentially send a reply stating they were thankful for the customer feedback but since it's not an issue effecting multiple people they can't help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If i reinstall the old version(does the chat history return?) wont i have to reinstall the newer one soon after as well?</p>

            Thanks soo much for your help. The chat history has returned, when i reinstalled&nbsp; the older version. I have never specified anything like that before(on keeping my history beyond a month)&nbsp; but before today i was able to access all my previous chats from
 3-4 years ago as well,which i always found to be very useful.<br />
<br />
Though now i fear this issue might recur if i were&nbsp; to reinstall 8.25 once again. Have there been many such complainants about the newer version? Have they reportedly taken any measures yet to improve it's functionality?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Xbox One S 2TB Console - Gears of War 4 Limited Edition Bundle - Release date?</p>

<p>I thought this game came out early on 10/7/16 but gamestop.com and amazon.com say if you pre order the console bundle you get it 10/6/16 even a day earlier can anyone confirm this?</p>

<h2>            Cannot install Update KB2868626 - No Error Message - Windows reverts changes</h2>
                    <p>I know that this is an identical subject to another question, but there doesn't appear to be anything of help in the other thread and the answer relates to a completely different update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeatedly installed this update through Windows Update and each time it fails and rolls the changes back. It also keeps trying to install on shutdown. There is an error detail if you look at the update history which quotes Code 80070490 which simply
 leads to generic problem solving for Windows Update. I have tried downloading the update manually and this has done the same thing (although it lists in the update history as Security Update for Windows instead of Security Update for Windows Vista and the
 error was Code 80073AA2 - same generic help though). Apart from this one everything is up to date. This is on a 32 bit installation of Windows Vista with SP2.</p>

<p>1. Is KB2962872, KB2971850, KB2973201, KB2961072 and/or KB2972280 listed in <strong>
Installed Updates</strong> (<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes bar the first one (KB2962872). This isn't being offered through Windows Update so I've not come across it (except I have visited the page when searching for this problem, but I've spotted no details on how it relates so haven't installed it without a
 clear understandable reason). I'm saying it isn't installed, I have been through the installed updates carefully twice, but there is no easy way to search for it or sort by KB number, etc. - oh for a decent pipe through grep!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to the puzzle, I have just been offered KB2962872 through Windows Update even though it as never been offered before - and that has been checked before the Java and Flash updates below. Update KB2868626 has failed to install again though as did KB296287.
 I'll have to try downloading and installing this new update manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How about KB2893294, KB2892075, KB2887069 and/or KB971029?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes to all of them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Update 51 which is dissapointing since it should be auto updating, but that is updated now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v14.0.0.145</strong> (or higher) installed?

<p>
</p><p>Yes, for Firefox, no for IE, that is reporting 9.0.115.0. Not using IE I assumed that if it was installed it would be auto updated along with the Firefox version. The Flash section of the Control Panel doesn't report an ActiveX version installed at all though,
 so perhaps it is just so old it isn't supported. That is also updated now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is IE7, IE8 or IE9 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 9, although historically upgraded through Windows update from IE7 through IE8 to IE9. Currently version 9.0.8112.16421 Update Versions 9.0.28 (KB2957689)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the very latest Firefox, I don't like, use or trust IE I'm afraid. I've spent too long clearing malware off a fully patched Windows machine with the latest AV running to risk IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;<em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; Glary Utilities; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser;

<em>Registry Cleaner </em>component)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not in the habit, no, but I have used CCCleaner to sort out a problem in the past. I've also followed MS guidelines to clear the Windows Udate history to get Windows Update working again, which it has been up until now.</p>

            <p>I was expecting my reply to have the quotes indented or marked so my comments were easier to read - never mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've tried installing both KB2962872 and KB2868626 manually and both are rolled back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried Windows Fix It. Last time I tried it I was told that the service had been discontinued by the web page I was directed to - hence resorting to CCleaner and a manual reset of Windows Update. This time it seems to have been resurected, but unfortunately,
 apart from fixing a selection of other issues, the one I am particularly interested in "Problems installing recent updates" has not been fixed! It has reset Windows Update though, so I tried again, but after multiple reboots everything has been rolled back
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to have flashbacks to a problem with a new nVidia graphics driver that was installed through Windows Update and rolled back to the generic driver. That resulted in a reformat and reinstall to fix things (I put the money Microsoft wanted to
 fix it into new motherboard/cpu/memory to upgrade the hardware and do it myself - full retail license before anyone complains).</p>

<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Vista 32-bit computer?<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

</span>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Have you ever had occasion to do a Repair Install or a clean install of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Is KB2962872 listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong> now and if not, what error number is associated with the failed install according to
<strong>Update History</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. When (exact date) was KB2957689 installed according to <strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6c. When (exact date) was <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9</strong> installed according to
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is <strong>Java Version 7 Update 65</strong> installed now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Can you successfully upgrade to Flash Player v14.0.0.145 (or higher) by opening Internet Explorer (<em>ONLY!</em>) to this page? =&gt;

<ul>
<li><strong><em>BEWARE any pre-checked options to "drive-by" install unwanted, third-party software (e.g., Google Toolbar; Google Chrome)!</em></strong></li></ul>
<p>9. May we assume that Firefox is the system's default Browser?</p>

</p><p>10. Do you have backups of ALL the changes CCleaner's Registry Cleaner component has EVER made to the computer? [1]</p>

            <p>1. Good question, around August 2008 I think.</p>
<p>2. The latest version of AVG Free and Clamwin; no subscription on either</p>
<p>3. NO, I've never used Norton on my own computers, even when I could use it free because my employer had a license back in the 90s; McAfee I haven't used since the 90s</p>
<p>4. There's no trace of anything on there, and I don't remember there being an install, possibly an icon to download a trial that was never used (this is a Dell after all)</p>
<p>5. No</p>
<p>6a. No; the error in update history is 80073AA2, the help for which is so generic you end up in an endless loop if you follow it</p>
<p>6b. 12/6/2014</p>
<p>6c. 18/9/2011</p>
<p>7. yes</p>
<p>8. already done, direct from Adobe and avoiding Ask and/or Google provided additions.</p>
<p>9. yes it is</p>
<p>10. yes I do, I have one that looks to coincide with the IE9 install, and one from March last year</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help, btw. I've been doing this sort of thing since Windows 3.0 (and before on other systems), but every once in a while there comes an issue where finding the key piece of information to resolve the issue proves elusive.</p>

            <p>It does indeed unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had two AV products installed for some time, but in this case it isn't an issue. I'd never install Norton and McAffee together for example (bad example, I wouldn't install them individually!), but Clamwin does not have an on access scanner, it just
 scans when you tell it to, so will have no impact on any other AV software on the computer. It is a handy check and balance if I happen to have a suspicious file I want to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to try the Windows Fix It again, but although it claimed to have fixed the Windows Update issues (amongst others) when it came to installing these two updates and rebooting, they both rolled back as per usual unfortunately</p>

            <p>Most Dell computers come with a Norton or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Chances are the "leftovers" is the cause of your problem.

            <p>No sign of any directories for Norton or Symantec, but one registry entry for NortonSystemInfo under DirectDraw - which is still there after running the removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No sign of any directories, but a few McAfee entries in the registry referring to something to do with a virtualstore - not investigated, but they are still there after running the removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unistalled Clamwin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully remembered to temporarily hide the failing updates during these reboots otherwise it would have taken forever to install and roll them back each time! (this mentioned for reference for anyone trying to follow this at a later date from a search).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the ie8-rereg (after checking the script), reset default browser, reset IE including personal settings (nothing there anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Fix It 50202 but this failed due to a problem with the registration of the script engine (error code 2738), so I've run Fix It 50181 first then 50202 worked fine in default and agressive with reboot between (no Windows Update history there anyway now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted, checked that the updates were no longer listed as hiden (config reset), ran manual check, installed the updates and rebooted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and the changes were reverted as usual (and boy does it take a long time to install, configure and then revert each of the two updates with the reboots at each stage!).</p>

<h2>            One install two licences for native boot and virtual machine.</h2>
                    I have a native boot windows 10 install that I sometimes use in a virtual machine as well. Would having two licenses allow me to have both configurations activated or does windows only hold one key per install?

            <p>Good question. Activation is tied to the machine on which Windows 10 is installed. A virtual machine is its own machine and needs its own license for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same free upgrade rules also apply to a virtual machine, so if you're upgrading a Win 7 SP1 or Win 8.1 VM you can install Windows 10 without a license, i.e., free.</p>

            <p>That sounds reasonable enough but it doesn't answer my question. If I do have two licenses will I be able to run the same the vhd on two different machines at once or will I constantly be reentering the license keys in order to keep activated on both machines.
 If the later is the case then it is not even worth it to buy the second license because the use will be the same as having one license.</p>

            <p>Agastya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the things you mention will achieve what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To accomplish what you want, you need to make a "system image".&nbsp; There is some guidance in Windows Help and in
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5495-system-image-create-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Image - Create in Windows 10 - Windows 10 Forums</a>&nbsp; If you restore a system image then the system drive will be in exactly the same state that it was when the image was made&nbsp;- Windows, applications, drivers, settings, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows installation is ever so corrupted that you cannot get it to run well enough to restore that system image, you will need to boot the computer using a Recovery drive, System repair disk or installation disk.&nbsp; So make one of them now if you
 have not done so already.&nbsp; There is also some guidance on these in Windows Help and in

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can't sign in to a game on Windows 10, this may be due to an issue with your Xbox profile or in-game account. Another factor that we have to take into consideration is the Xbox Live server status. For us to determine the root cause of this issue, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried playing other games and check if the same thing occurs?</li><li>Are you able to access your Xbox account?</li><li>Are you using the same email address to sign in to the Xbox app and the game?</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check if there are any ongoing service alerts, kindly visit the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Status</a> page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We also need to verify if there's something wrong with your Xbox profile. To do this, we recommend that you sign in to
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a> using the Microsoft account associated to your Xbox profile. If you can sign in, that means your profile is all good. Otherwise, follow the on-screen prompts to update your account information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We'll be waiting for your response. We'd be glad to provide you additional assistance.

</p><p>I've formatted and reinstalled windows a number of times, updated the drivers to latest, but it always eventually freezes and forces me to power it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most often I can force a freeze by starting a game of Battlegrounds and playing for a couple of minutes. The fans are still running and the CPU isn't hot, but the screen freezes and the audio has a buzzing sound. If I have the task manager up, I sometimes
 notice that the wifi stops working first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rule out the wifi card being the issue, I tried connecting to LAN, but still had the freeze issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for suggestions to fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a diagnostic software I can run which logs events leading up to the freeze? Event viewer does not indicate anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>2. This is a huge gaming CPU. Can I take it into a Microsoft store and have them look into it for me? I'd feel stupid to walk in there with this thing and have them tell me no!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there's any other information I can provide.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This PC was running Windows 7 (with no problems) prior to me installing Windows 10. Ever since I installed 10, it freezes after some time.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you get any error messages?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No error messages, just freezes and I have to hold down the power button to turn it off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far aside from reinstalling Windows and updating drivers?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Initially there was some trouble with Windows starting up every now and then. I tried unplugging the wifi adapter (Netgear A6210) and plugging in the LAN cable instead. This worked and windows was starting up and updating fine. However it still froze
 on LAN. I updated the wifi adapter drivers and that fixed the startup issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I disabled unneeded startup programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; No antivirus installed except Windows defender</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; sfc /scannow returned no integrity violations</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ran HWMonitor to monitor temperatures. Everything was normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased virtual memory to 1000 mb</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; changed Visual effects to 'best performance'</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I tried most of the things on the link you posted. It still freezes.</p>

<p>Hey Gogojello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Perfmon /report</strong>&nbsp; from an elevated command prompt explained in this Tech Republic article&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-windows-10-system-diagnostic-report-to-gather-troubleshooting-info-on-the-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a></p>

<p>Hardware Device and Driver Checks seems to be the area in question as you previously stated.</p>
<p>1. Motherboard devices</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Plug and Play Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Survey the entire report by expanding all of it.&nbsp; You can make a complete copy by going to FILE and saving it.&nbsp; Then import the entire file in a later reply.</p>
<p>But I see what you see here...&nbsp; I'm not an expert in analyzing the Perfmon Report but it's not that difficult.&nbsp; #1 and .#2 above need further investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning your Windows 10 license is it OEM or retail.&nbsp; Generally OEM doesn't allow for mobo swaps but I'm not sure about updates to the mobo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">chat support </span>can be very helpful and accommodating after changing hardware on a device.&nbsp; You must request a live human chat after talking with the bot chat.&nbsp; Then explain your situation to the live human
 chat..mobo update, etc.&nbsp; Chat Support is found&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have worked with people that MS granted a free license even when the mobo was swapped out on a OEM license.</p>

<h2>            After I installed Windows 10, I can&#39;t disable the touchpad on my Dell Inspiron N5030 laptop. Please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
This past weekend I did a full clean Windows 10 install on my laptop. However after the install, I went to Dell Support website to download the Touchpad Driver for my N5030, but Windows 10 told me this driver software is not supported by the OS.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I also tried going to "Mouse &amp; Touchpad Setting" and clicked on "Additional mouse options". However, in the "Mouse Properties" box, I can't find "Touchpad" or "Clickpad" tab, so there's no way for me to turn on/off my touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I know my laptop is a bit too old for Windows 10, but I still have a gut feeling that this touchpad should be able to be set somewhere!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thank you very much in advance for you help!!!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help. I tried every step of your above instructions by selecting "Run this program in Compatibility mode" and by choosing "Windows 7", but when I ran the setup in compatibility mode, it didn't actually start the installation and no dialog
 box was shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think even though Dell Insprion N5030 doesn't support Windows 10, the previous driver should still work in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other solutions you want me to try, please let me know!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues with the above mentioned error message. We will surely help you with the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some more information on this issue to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do you get this error message while, using one particular application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Apart from installing Windows Updates, do remember making any other changes in the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is your computer connected to a Domain Network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>You may try to put the computer in safe mode and test the issue because,
</span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Follow the link below to boot to safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issues doesn't appear in safe mode try </span>
<span>putting your system in Clean Boot state because, it helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>Note</em></strong></span><span><strong><span><em>: </em></span></strong><span><em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" under more information to reset the computer to start as normal
 after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, </span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Open the link and follow the instructions in to get the event logs so that we can see which application is faulty.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>a) Open<strong> Control Panel</strong>, Go to<strong> System and Security</strong>, Click
<strong>Administrative Tools </strong>and select<strong> View Event Logs.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>b) Select <strong>Windows Logs </strong>on the left side of the window.</span></span></p>

            <p>1) Do you get this error message while, using one particular application?<br />
No. &nbsp;It first appeared after I did the Windows Updates. &nbsp;It appears after start up before I open any applications or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Apart from installing Windows Updates, do remember making any other changes in the computer?</p>
<p>I did install several programs but the error appeared before I did any of that. &nbsp;As mentioned above, it first appeared after doing Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is your computer connected to a Domain Network?</p>
<p>It's connected to wifi and there are other devices also connected to that wifi. &nbsp;But I don't think it's connected to a domain network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When starting in Safe Mode the error did not appear after start up.</p>

            <p>I apologize - apparently I didn't wait long enough in clean reboot. &nbsp;I forgot to switch back to normal start up today and the error appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went back into msconfig and switched back to normal. &nbsp;The error was still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the third part of your suggestion was to look at the error log, which I did, did the above cited errors provide any additional insight to the problem?</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the above given event logs we got the below information: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>An attached device is not working</strong> for one of these reasons: (1) it is switched off, or connected improperly; (2) the floppy disk and drive types are incompatible; (3) the floppy disk is not properly inserted in the drive; (4) the drive door
 is open; or (5) the floppy disk is not properly formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to disconnect all the external device and test the issue if persists. Also if you are connecting a modem, try to restart the modem and check.</p>

<h2>            people wont connect to facebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I cant seem to get my people app on my surface pro to connect and sync to Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened all of a sudden when I set my device to be trusted and allow syncing. (or maybe its coincidence). Every time I click add account, and select Facebook it just says '' you are ready to go'' but non of my&nbsp;contacts are synced and it still won't
 show Facebook on my connected account list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have contacted Microsoft and they apparently have never came accords such problem before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me.</p>

            <p>yeah I realised that. seem like it still has not been solved yet. because my windows phone is stil unable to connect to facebook chat trough the messaging app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the problem I stated is with my people app. it would not sync my facebook if I synced my Hotmail to people app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>just prior to getting my surface, I renamed my primary Hotmail alice to a outlook alice and made my Hotmail into the secondary. which means my Microsoft account now is a outlook.com alice. how ever when I put both Hotmail and outlook into my peoples hub,
 it all goes crazy. my facebook, google, skype will suddenly stop synchronising and will only leave me with my outlook and Hotmail contacts in the people hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can you explain to me what happened? I had to reset my surface a few times to find out the problem.</p>

<font color="#0072c6">Nyx.Jawad,</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I do not have a Facebook connection I've been suffering of this Messaging issue - still unresolved as I write - with the Windows 8 Mail, People and Messaging&nbsp;app (Skype is also impacted on my side for contacts that do not have a Skype but a Messenger
 only account).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After spending significant time investigating how all these apps are connected together I came to the conclusion there is nothing I can do on my side to make them work as expected until the Microsoft/Facebook messaging issue is resolved. Making too many
 changes on our side while they work on a solution is probably going to cause for problems IMHO. Although this is quite frustrating - we have workarounds though - I'm gonna wait the resolution of this issue before spending any more time on this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I'm not an expert in all of this I strongly believe your problem somehow relates to this Microsoft/Facebook messaging issue and that it's going to be virtually impossible to fix until this latter has been fully resolved. Having that said I would
 suggest you move your thread to the appropriate&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive">Microsoft account, Outlook.com, SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;forum where there are people with much more expertise than mine with regard to the problem you're facing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my sincere apologizes for not being able to help you more.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>it was reported on the 23 of June and this is already 28th. Does it really take this long for microsoft to fix it?</p>

            Hi yankeejoeychan,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
You can install the printer driver in Windows Vista compatibility mode and make your printer work.<br />
Use this link : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
<br />
<br />
But if you want to uninstall the Vista compatible drivers for Windows 7 drivers, you may follow these steps given below<br />
<strong><br />
To uninstall a printer driver manually :</strong> <br />
<br />
Click on start &gt; type in devmgmt.msc in search box, hit enter&gt; right click on the printer drivers from the list of devices and click on uninstall. And restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Once you restart the computer, you can download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website install the same on the computer.<br />
<br />
Once you install the drivers on the computer, then you may have to restart the <strong>
Printer Spooler service.</strong> <br />
<br />
A print spooler is software that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please follow the steps below:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type administrative tools, and then click Administrative Tools.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click Services. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Multiple Xbox Ones and profiles for children</h2>
                    <p>Hi I was wondering if someone could clarify for me something which I am having trouble understanding since its quite complicated and revolves around the licencing of games Ive bought through the Xbox Store.</p><p>I recently upgraded my Xbox to the new X version which Im very much enjoying so far but as this has liberated my old Xbox One I want to give it to my youngest son. My elder son already has an Xbox One so that makes 3 in my household. My eldest sons Xbox is marked as my Home Xbox so that he can share my games without needing to sign in my profile&nbsp;and I can also purchase games for him through my account and they are usuable for the both of us. This means that on my Xbox One X I need to be signed in to play my own games which is fine, but now my 3rd Xbox will be given to my other son and he will want to play all the lego games of his which I have bought for him under my account.</p><p>How can I go about getting my games playable on the respective consoles of my children witho

<h2>            Typing delay and unresponsive keyboard after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This computer has developed a problem, that has introduced a keyboard delay/lag shortly after upgrading to windows 10 rendering the system nearly unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried disabling services. Deleting/updating drivers. Different keyboards. Have not reverted back yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if this has been addressed or solved previously. Attempting to perform multiple searches without a functional keyboard is infuriating.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the consideration!</p>

            <p>Thanks Anna for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not get any error message, but the game would turn off after I completed one round, and the score was not changing. &nbsp;I ran the troubleshooter before I contacted the community. &nbsp;I also ran a system restore to an earlier date. &nbsp;When I opened the game
 after the restore, it still showed the game as installed, but it did not open the game at the same level or completion. &nbsp;It opened back to the very beginning of the game.</p>

 for ten minutes while playing a game digital and disc copy. Ive done all the troubleshooting suggestions but to no avail more crashing. Im sure i cant be the only one to have this issue. And if this new console i am receiving doesn't fix the problem. Im just
 going to give to console and games accessories we purchased for it to goodwill or better yet a dumpster . This has been a terrible experience for us as users of the product to buy a brand new console only to be burnt twice in un

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Sorry you're experiencing these issues. &nbsp;I see Killa2306 has said NBA2k14 seems to be causing his "crash to dashboard", is there a particular game causing problems with you CHi3FxBLuNtZ??</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The crash to dashboard is usually bugs in the games.. Battlefied 4 used to do it all the time, but after some recent patches (and more expected) they ironed out a lot of the crashes. &nbsp;I have had no problems with Dead Rising 3, Forza 5 and Peggle, I'll have
 Assassins creed tonight to try as well.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If its a particular game you're experiencing this issue with, please hop into that games forum here and post your details or respond to an existing thread with your feedback.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Game on!</p>

<p>well blahism my issue happens with every game! and my system doesn't dashboard it completely shuts of the only way to get it back on is to unplug to power supply from the outlet and wait a min then plug it back in and it works until i play a game. right
 not its weird because with the kinect unplug it doesn't crash the system right away it a lil longer. I've tried a new console and new power supply the only thing i haven't tried is a new kinect. and xbox support isn't even taking the time to really hear what
 I've been going thru. you can see when i made this post its been almost a month since this problem and i have yet to find a solution and microsoft is taking there sweetest time and finding me a solution aswell. all this is making me regret purchasing this

<p>Do digital downloaded games do it too? If &nbsp;so then I would call it a faulty system . If it only does it with game discs then I would assume it's the disc player .</p>
<p>Either way &nbsp;something aint right and you should use the warrenty or if you bought it at a brick and mortar store see if they will replace it. Gamestop for example gives you 30 guarentee.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 activation after update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l0rd z3us  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 activation after update.</h2>
                    <p>I have this very interesting, and also very frustrating problem.<br />
<br />
I was running windows 7 (all activated and legitimate) on a number of PC's for some time, all were successfully (and very reluctantly) upgraded to windows 10 and then the fall creators update and were working (well.. as well as windows 10 works), but they lost
 their activation.<br />
<br />
When the last big update came out after the creators update, essentially a stupid in place upgrade (aside from a few blue screens which were a result of windows pushing graphics and audio drivers that were incompatible and were sorted by uninstalling and using
 older drivers) each pc and laptop seemed to upgrade with little issue. (Don't you love it when windows blue screens then tells you it's your hardware and your just thinking.. no, your just rubbish windows 10, you've installed another bad driver silently haven't
 you windows, bad windows bad!)<br />
<br />
However, 3 of them i noticed had very limited options in the settings and then informed me that windows needed to be activated (windows isn't activated did not appear until i clicked on settings or tried logging into the store), i left it a couple of days as
 advised in the win 10 documentation to allow the license to filter down but with no joy as it won't even update!.<br />
<br />
I have worked in IT for over 26 years and windows 10 (and it's random problems due to dep, or security, faulty updates, drivers or permissions etc) is driving me to frustration. I have checked the security, i have run the troubleshooting tool, there are licenses
 for the PC's and I have the correct version of windows 10 installed. It is not a hardware, network or driver problem.<br />
<br />
I have run sfc/scannow, i have checked the hdd for bad sectors, I have run chkdsk /x /f /v /r and also run the dism tools. The hard drives and windows files are intact and fine.<br />
<br />
On 2 of them running the least apps out of sheer frustration I decided to format, re install windows 10 from scratch and all the apps I had on them with the latest windows 10 iso version downloaded after the creators update, and my original fall creators update
 dvd made using the windows tool. but when windows 10 finishes installing and loads, the same problem. All necessary services are all running and have been uninstalled and re installed and restarted, re registered, there is literally no resolution I have not
 tried.<br />
<br />
By default I only ever have a local log on, When I logged in to my windows store account via the troubleshooter failing and saynig to buy a key or see if it could retrieve my key (as it thinks i have changed hardware, and troubleshooter couldn't find any problems).
 (Then told me i had no key for this pc on my account, yet tells me it has a key for the device... WTF microsoft?, then changed my log in to using my Microsoft account (which i wouldn't on these pc's) and would not let me change the login back to local due
 to limited settings), it won't allow windows updates to install as it isn't activated which limits things even further updating the license or logging on with other fmeans which may have the license, I have never before dealt with an operating system that
 generates so many unnecessary and stupid problems.<br />
<br />
I have tried all the advice from the Microsoft help pages, the forums and windows 10 tech pages i can find and nothing resolves this for me.
<br />
<br />
The only way i have found online that i haven't tried, or on other people's computers i have been asked to repair and come across, is a third party windows 10 activator. Having never used illegal or third party software I don't want to go down this route as
 you shouldn't have to use third party software to be able to use your legitimate copies of windows.<br />
<br />
Windows 10, There has been no changes in hardware, i have a key for the PC, what is wrong with this picture!, and it's really insulting when troubleshooting fails then tells me to go to the store and buy a key!.<br />
<br />

            I am going to reroute your question right back to Microsoft because anything we would suggest sounds like it has been done and we don't have access to Microsoft licensing to verify licenses.
<br />I am sorry you are going through this problem and the activation team will be able to sort you out.

<h2>            touchsmart 320 touchscreen not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As indicated in another post: Windows 8 loader clearly indicated that the touchscreen functionalities would be "limited"... instead such obvious feature on a TOUCHSCREEN PC simply DO NOT WORK and neither HP nor Microsoft do anything about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not matter who I go to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1- HP:</strong> they wash their hands by essentially indicating that upgrading to Windows 8 its done at the user's risks as they say "<strong>Windows 7 PCs with touch will not have full Windows 8 touch capabilities after upgrade</strong>" (<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c03457468&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=5157096&amp;softwareitem=cp-112060-1&amp;sw_lang=es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c03457468&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=5157096&amp;softwareitem=cp-112060-1&amp;sw_lang=es</a>).
<strong><u>WHAT?!</u></strong> (I cannot even go back to Win7 as HP charges me for shipping to me recovery disks!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2- Microsoft:</strong>&nbsp;the "compatibility mode" is useless&nbsp;as when used the installation for the Win7 drivers end up failing with the error message "Your system does not meet operating system requirements (9998)". Also, Microsoft refuses to refund
 the purchase of Windows 8 because the license has been activated...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- NextWindow: as the manufacturer of the touchscreen, they have generic drivers ...but none clearly support my model (<a href="http://www.nextwindow.com/nextwindow_support/Windows_8_Touch_Screen_Driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nextwindow.com/nextwindow_support/Windows_8_Touch_Screen_Driver.html</a>).
 I have reached out to their support center... no response</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel as I have wasted&nbsp;$40 in this "upgrade" just to have my $800 become useless for its selling feature: TOUCHSCREEN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who in Microsoft will address this issue and provide a definite&nbsp;fix to this problem? ...or like many other frustrated users,&nbsp;do I have to spend more money and go with fancy Apple products?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

Which model?&nbsp;&nbsp; Search with your Product number.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like some even have Windows 8 support already.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, like my tx2 you may have to find W7 compatibility to be able to use W8.</p>

            am afraid to say this but I think Microsoft mess up in this one guys. I tried most operating systems and the touchscreen does not seem to work on any of them, I tried all sorts of sites and forums for answers but plain answer is "use the system restore."
 so no windows 8 that I am aware of so far.
