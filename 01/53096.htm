<h2>            hard disk is being accessed all the time &#40;aka &#34;constant spinning&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    I have a problem. I'm running Win XP SP3 on a Toshiba laptop, on a WD Scorio hard drive. Of late the drive never stops spinning - the noise it makes when accessed never stops, even when no applications are running. I switched off indexing, and I removed

<p>Does the Laptop Slow when you open programs/files/directories?</p>
<p>It can be the laptop is overheating and the CPU fan trying to cool down the system or the CPU clotted with Dusts and hair, and need to be cleaned by blowing the Dust out by using Anti-static Air Duster.</p>
<p>Also, if it is grinding noise, it can mean the HDD is going bad, please backup your sensitive Data and be ready when the day come!</p>
<p>Use these tools to get a clear idea what is running on your system and may causing the HDD to spin fast causing the Noise if that true!</p>

            Hi Nathan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) First try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Multiple Accounts, Multiple Troubles</h2>
                    <p>Over time I have somehow created at least three Skype accounts, compounded when Skype was acquired by Microsoft, and my multiple attempts to login to Microsoft got me blocked (for life?).&nbsp; Every time I need to access Skype for job interviews there are problems,
 even when -- as just happened recently -- I beg the recruiter to make sure it will work before the interview.&nbsp; She contacted me from her device, from her car, with no issue, but when it came time to do the actual interview they could not connect with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.&nbsp; How do I delete accounts so I have just one?</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; How can I assure employers that I am not Skype Kryptonite, and that it may, eventually, one day, actually work for me?</p>

<p><span>Kindly go through the reminders provided before proceeding with account deletion.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>B. For Skype to work for you, you just need to sign in using the same credentials you have utilized when creating the account.
 If you have used a Skype name, use the same Sype name. If you have used your email address, then log in using the said email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You also have to provide the exact Skype name or Skype ID to your contacts for them to be able to locate your correct account.</span></p>

    <title>I only did Part I to recover from a corrupt registry&#33; Help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgmcmanus  say:</h3>
<h2>            I only did Part I to recover from a corrupt registry&#33; Help</h2>
                    <em>A couple of weeks ago I got a Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM .&nbsp; I did a recovery using the following</em>
<br />
Part one<br />

In part one, you start the Recovery Console, create a temporary folder, back up the existing registry files to a new location, delete the registry files at their existing location, and then copy the registry files from the repair folder to the System32\Config
 folder. When you have finished this procedure, a registry is created that you can use to start Windows XP. This registry was created and saved during the initial setup of Windows XP. Therefore any changes and settings that occurred after the Setup program
 was finished are lost.<br />
<br />
To complete part one, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Insert the Windows XP startup disk into the floppy disk drive, or insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then restart the computer.
<br />
Click to select any options that are required to start the computer from the CD-ROM drive if you are prompted to do so.
</li><li>When the "Welcome to Setup" screen appears, press R to start the Recovery Console.
</li><li>If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.
</li><li>When you are prompted to do so, type the Administrator password. If the administrator password is blank, just press ENTER.
</li><li>At the Recovery Console command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:
<div><span>md tmp<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\system c:\windows\tmp\system.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\software c:\windows\tmp\software.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\sam c:\windows\tmp\sam.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\security c:\windows\tmp\security.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\default c:\windows\tmp\default.bak<br />
<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\default<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\system c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\software c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\sam c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\security c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\default c:\windows\system32\config\default<br />
</span></div>
</li><li>Type <span>exit</span> to quit Recovery Console. Your computer will restart.
</li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong> This procedure assumes that Windows XP is installed to the C:\Windows folder. Make sure to change C:\Windows to the appropriate windows_folder if it is a different location.<br />
<br />
If you have access to another computer, to save time, you can copy the text in step five, and then create a text file called "Regcopy1.txt" (for example). To use this file, run the following command when you start in Recovery Console:
<div><strong>batch regcopy1.txt</strong></div>
With the <strong>batch</strong> command in Recovery Console, you can process all the commands in a text file sequentially. When you use the
<strong>batch</strong> command, you do not have to manually type as many commands.
Part two
To complete the procedure described in this section, you must be logged on as an administrator, or an administrative user (a user who has an account in the Administrators group). If you are using Windows XP Home Edition, you can log on as an administrative
 user. If you log on as an administrator, you must first start Windows XP Home Edition in Safe mode. To start the Windows XP Home Edition computer in Safe mode, follow these steps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Print these instructions before you continue. You cannot view these instructions after you restart the computer in Safe Mode. If you use the NTFS file system, also print the instructions from Knowledge Base article KB309531. Step 7 contains
 a reference to the article.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Shut Down</strong> (or click <strong>
Turn Off Computer</strong>), click <strong>Restart</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong> (or click <strong>Restart</strong>). </li><li>Press the F8 key. <br />
<br />
On a computer that is configured to start to multiple operating systems, you can press F8 when you see the Startup menu.
</li><li>Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate Safe mode option, and then press ENTER.
</li><li>If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot system, use the arrow keys to select the installation that you want to access, and then press ENTER.
</li></ol>
In part two, you copy the registry files from their backed up location by using System Restore. This folder is not available in Recovery Console and is generally not visible during typical usage. Before you start this procedure, you must change several settings
 to make the folder visible:
<ol>
<li>Start Windows Explorer. </li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Folder options</strong>. </li><li>Click the <strong>View</strong> tab. </li><li>Under <strong>Hidden files and folders</strong>, click to select
<strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)</strong> check box.
</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when the dialog box that confirms that you want to display these files appears.
</li><li>Double-click the drive where you installed Windows XP to display a list of the folders. If is important to click the correct drive.
</li><li>Open the System Volume Information folder. This folder is unavailable and appears dimmed because it is set as a super-hidden folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> This folder contains one or more _restore {GUID} folders such as "_restore{87BD3667-3246-476B-923F-F86E30B3E7F8}".<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You may receive the following error message:
<div>
<div>
<div>C:\System Volume Information is not accessible. Access is denied.</div>

</li><li>Open a folder that was not created at the current time. You may have to click
<strong>Details</strong> on the <strong>View</strong> menu to see when these folders were created. There may be one or more folders starting with "RPx under this folder. These are restore points.
</li><li>Open one of these folders to locate a Snapshot subfolder. The following path is an example of a folder path to the Snapshot folder:
<div>C:\System Volume Information\_restore{D86480E3-73EF-47BC-A0EB-A81BE6EE3ED8}\RP1\Snapshot</div>
</li><li>From the Snapshot folder, copy the following files to the C:\Windows\Tmp folder:
<ul>
<li>_REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM </li></ul>
</li><li>Rename the files in the C:\Windows\Tmp folder as follows:
<ul>
<li>Rename _REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT to DEFAULT </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY to SECURITY </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE to SOFTWARE </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM to SYSTEM </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM to SAM </li></ul>
</li></ol>
These files are the backed up registry files from System Restore. Because you used the registry file that the Setup program created, this registry does not know that these restore points exist and are available. A new folder is created with a new GUID under
 System Volume Information and a restore point is created that includes a copy of the registry files that were copied during part one. Therefore, it is important not to use the most current folder, especially if the time stamp on the folder is the same as the
 current time. <br />
<br />
The current system configuration is not aware of the previous restore points. You must have a previous copy of the registry from a previous restore point to make the previous restore points available again.
<br />
<br />
The registry files that were copied to the Tmp folder in the C:\Windows folder are moved to make sure that the files are available under Recovery Console. You must use these files to replace the registry files currently in the C:\Windows\System32\Config folder.
 By default, Recovery Console has limited folder access and cannot copy files from the System Volume folder.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> The procedure described in this section assumes that you are running your computer with the FAT32 file system. For more information about how to access the System Volume Information Folder with the NTFS file system, click the following

Part Three
In part three, you delete the existing registry files, and then copy the System Restore Registry files to the C:\Windows\System32\Config folder:
<ol>
<li>Start Recovery Console. </li><li>At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:
<div><span>del c:\windows\system32\config\sam
<br />
<br />
del c:\windows\system32\config\security <br />
<br />
del c:\windows\system32\config\software <br />
<br />
del c:\windows\system32\config\default <br />
<br />
del c:\windows\system32\config\system <br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\tmp\software c:\windows\system32\config\software <br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\tmp\system c:\windows\system32\config\system <br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\tmp\sam c:\windows\system32\config\sam <br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\tmp\security c:\windows\system32\config\security <br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\tmp\default c:\windows\system32\config\default </span></div>
<strong>Note</strong> Some of these command lines may be wrapped for readability.
</li><li>Type <span>exit</span> to quit Recovery Console. Your computer restarts.
</li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong> This procedure assumes that Windows XP is installed to the C:\Windows folder. Make sure to change C:\Windows to the appropriate windows_folder if it is a different location.<br />
<br />
If you have access to another computer, to save time, you can copy the text in step two, and then create a text file called "Regcopy2.txt" (for example). To use this file, run the following command when you start in Recovery Console:
<div><strong>batch regcopy2.txt</strong></div>
Part Four
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>All Programs</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Accessories</strong>, and then click <strong>System Tools</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>System Restore</strong>, and then click <strong>
Restore to a previous RestorePoint</strong>. </li></ol>
<div><br />
<br />
But after&nbsp;Part I, my system was up and running so I did not do parts 2 3&amp;4.&nbsp; The other day I had the same error message when I booted so I thought no problem I will try this again.&nbsp; Except when I get to the part in Part I that say type md tmp enter, I get the
 message that file already exists.&nbsp; Can some help me with this problem please, I have tons of pics and music that I need to save!&nbsp; I had windows xp professional with all service packs.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the folder tmp already exists then you can either remove it with command "rd tmp" and then create it again or you can just create a different name like tmp1.&nbsp; If you keep having registry errors you may want to consider backing up all your data and
 then doing a clean install.

            <p>Why is it that every time someone asks a question about the Windows 8 music or Video apps, the solution is always a link to a solution to apps not running. The question has nothing to do with the app not running. The problem is that auto playlists are empty.
 Do the support personnel every do any actual checking into these issues before copy and pasting canned responses?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaleb, the Metro music app does not support auto playlists. It's an obvious oversight, but there it is. The playlists imported from WMP or Zune are empty because the playlists files don't actually have any songs listed in them; all the playlist files actually
 are are sets of instructions. Instead of a saying to WMP/Zune "here's a list of songs, play these" auto playlists tells the WMP to scan the library for songs that meet your criteria and play them. Since the music app doesn't do that, it can't open the auto
 playlists you already had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really, the app needs some work. A good chunk of my songs don't display album art (even though I meticulously embedded it), it doesn't support auto playlists, and it doesn't have a rating system.</p>

            I don't understand what's so hard for Microsoft to understand. Let me give the support people steps taken to produce the problem.
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Xbox Music is updated and that the Windows Phone app is installed.</li><li>Start the Xbox music app.</li><li>Download some music if you don't already have some in your collection.</li><li>Create a playlist using Xbox downloaded content and maybe some already existing content.</li><li>Plug in phone. The Windows Phone app will start. If the app doesn't start go ahead and start the Windows Phone app.</li><li>Now you can see that the playlist created in Xbox Music does NOT show up in the Windows Phone app. Therefore you CANNOT sync it.</li></ul>
<div>The problem is a simple one. Microsoft failed to test the standard process in which someone would use only Xbox Music and the Windows Phone app to manage their music. I'm not sure how this could be explained but coming from Zune to this is just unacceptable.</div>

            Bobby, that's not the same issue. It's not even remotely connected. The issue here is that autoplaylists created in Windows Media Player are not working in the Windows 8 music app. Windows phone has nothing to do with this.

            <p>Actually my theory is that it is the exact same root issue that we are both experiencing. I think the root problem is&nbsp;that Xbox Music does not&nbsp;store it's playlist in the "music" path. The music path is where Windows Media and the Windows Phone app both try
 to save to / sync&nbsp;from. This is why I can create playlist in the Xbox Music app and they won't show up in either Windows Phone sync apps. This is also why you can create playlist in Windows Media player yet the Xbox Music app won't show them.</p>

<p>Am I off track? Maybe I'm wrong? hum...</p>

            Except that the music app DOES show playlists you create in Windows Media Player. That's not the issue. The issue is that the
<b>auto</b> playlists -which show up just fine- are all blank under the Music app&nbsp;because the autoplaylists files don't actually have any songs listed in them; they're just sets of instructions. Instead of a saying to WMP/Zune "here's a list of songs, play
 these" auto playlists tells the WMP to scan the library for songs that meet your criteria and play them. Since the music app doesn't do that, it can't open the auto playlists you already had.

            OK, I see your point. I wasn't trying to hijack your issue either. I see where you are going with that and I'm not sure how long it will take them to fix that one. The fact remains that currently they are not supporting even basic playlist via Xbox Music
 and Windows Phone app so who knows how long it will take to support more advance playlist like the auto playlist. I should not have to create playlist in WMP. Sorry to intrude on your thread.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you are like me and don't use the Microsoft music pass:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Don't use the Windows 8,
<p>2. Don't use XMBOX Music App</p>
<p>3. Install Windows&nbsp;Phone App for
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already had synched with the metro Windows Phone app from my Windows 8 laptop, so I:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Wiped my phone (settings, about, reset phone), keep in mind this will wipe all data, so if you have anything you need on it then back it up first</p>
<p>2. Went through setup steps on my phone, but did not connect it to my computer</p>
<p>3. Removed the Music metro app (XBOX Music) and metro Windows Phone app</p>
<p>4. Downloaded and Installed the Windows Phone App for desktop</p>
<p>5. Recreated playlists I had deleted in trying to fix this issue by using my zune software and auto playlists, then closed the Zune software.</p>
<p>6. Plugged in my phone to my computer</p>
<p>7. Launched Windows Phone app for desktop</p>
<p>8. Selected the music and playlists I wanted and clicked synch button</p>
<p>
9.&nbsp; Now my playlists are on my phone, but have no songs</p>
<p>
10. I clicked sync again and I noticed it still said I had 6 songs to sync, I clicked again a couple times and got down to 3 songs and an error popped up that these 3 songs couldn't be synced.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
11.&nbsp;I closed the windows phone app</p>
<p>
12.&nbsp; I moved the 3 songs out of my music library to another location ( I used downloads)</p>
<p>
13.&nbsp; I opened the WP 8 desktop app and synched again.&nbsp; Now it said synching my playlists at the bottom
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I now have all my playlists populated.&nbsp; It must be the last thing that is synched and the error on the 3 songs prevented it from ever getting to it.</p>

            that's not true.&nbsp; Autoplaylists are not empty.&nbsp; The Zune software does the auto-population, but the playlist is actually a standard playlist.&nbsp; I was able to get mine on my WP8.&nbsp; The actual problem is likely either the app you are using or that you have
 errors synchronizing.&nbsp; Since the playlists synch last, they will be empty if your sync stops on an error.&nbsp; This was not visible to me in the metro app and in the desktop app I have to try sync a couple times before the error displayed.&nbsp; See my post further
 down this thread.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Typically, this error occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include an
 incompatible device driver, a general hardware problem, or incompatible software.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps in the following article:</span></p>
<p><span>“You receive a "Stop 0x0000000A" error message in Windows XP”:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314063</a>

            If you did a factory restore (of any computer), that will put it into the out of the box or when it left the factory condition and that could be something that is old and outdated.<br />
<br />
Manufacturers and vendors frequently come out with updates to drivers, so what you have after your factory restore may not be the latest stuff.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, you will find that you may need to update certain drivers or other things so your restored system has the latest and greatest files and drivers.<br />
<br />
I sincerely doubt you will get much satisfaction from the Microsoft Support Engineer advice since it is just a&nbsp; reference to a KB article...&nbsp; it is in fact the first Microsoft KB article to come up in a Bing search of your error message and that is a very weak
 troubleshooting method that involves no analysis.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Besides, the KB is too complicated and is unlikely to help you, but it is a MSE reply with a link to a KB article!&nbsp; But you can sure "try" those steps and see it helps (as they say).<br />
<br />
If your HDD is failing, there may be nothing to help you.<br />
<br />
Here is what is more likely to help you if you are not having a hard drive issue:<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>Please provide additional information about your system:</div>
<br />
<div>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?
<div><br />
<div>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<div><br />
Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?
<div><br />
<div>If your system was working okay, what do you think might have changed since the last time it worked properly?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

            <p>Hello fjcamacho,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is occurring after a factory restore and the hard disk failed a diagnostic test, we have no recourse but to believe that this is a hardware based issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, we can take a look at the dumps as well to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Can you zip up the contents of the C:\windows\minidumps folder and post&nbsp;the resulting .zip file&nbsp;in a public folder on
<a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.live.com</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>After doing so, post the link on this thread so that we can look the dumps over.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows10pro after upgrading the motherboard.</h2>
                    I have a problem activating windows when i switched my motherboard, processor and ram memory.<br />
I decided to upgrade my hardware and i was using windows7, for some reason my mouse and keyboard wasn't working after bios in the new motherboard.<br />
Windows7 didn't support usb 3.0 so i was forced to upgrade to windows10pro, coudn't do it with the new motherboard because my mouse and keyboard didn't work.<br />
I switched back to my old motherboard to be able to use the usb devices and do the upgrade.<br />
I purchased and installed windows10pro in my old motherboard(asus z77) to have support for usb3.0 and be able to use the new motherboard(gigabyte aorus pro wifi).<br />
I activated windows10pro with the key provided with the purchase, the price was 259€ that i found a bit excessive but i had to do it to have something as good as windows7.<br />
When i had everything set up with the OS in the old motherboard i switched to my new more powerful hardware and then the surprise got me.<br />
I had a message that my windows10pro wasn't activated, i used the key code from the purchase and said it wasn't valid.<br />
I didn't understand why it needed to be activated again when i activated already, isn't this supposed to be to activate the OS in the SSD? If so i already did it.<br />
I saw that there was the option to troubleshoot and to put that i had a hardware change but it still didn't work, it shows the code 0xC004C008.<br />
I tried everything from logging in to all my accounts, do it by phone with the automatic system, nothing helps and i don't feel like wasting another 259€ again.<br />
Please help.<br />

            Hi JavierNH, 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Since you have changed your motherboard, this is a hardware change.
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />For problems in activation, you can also reach out to Microsoft Support for activation help. They can work with you on this to resolve activation issues.
<br />
<br />By Live Agent Chat - <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />By Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need to verify whether it is OEM or Retail or Volume and other details, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Javier
<br />
<br />Since you purchased Windows 10, that is a Retail licence, and it does have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC
<br />
<br />The Activation Troubleshooter rarely resolves this, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

<p>I have two webcams, I could no longer use my integrated because it tells me that it's (somehow) a USB when it's not.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b16a7e88-824d-4461-8b86-ab3a08a0133c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b16a7e88-824d-4461-8b86-ab3a08a0133c" /></a></p>
<p>So i bought a USB camera online and I plugged it in and went to update the drivers (no, it did not come with a CD)<br />
and it still tells me access denied and the weird thing is it will shoot it down to "other Devices"<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bd36ddf-8249-4401-93d4-c653db9905c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bd36ddf-8249-4401-93d4-c653db9905c0" /></a></p>
<p>When it's in the imaging devices it will say error code 1 but when it goes down to the other devices it will say error code 28.&nbsp;<br />
I'm getting really annoyed with this.&nbsp;<br />
I have tried deleting the folder it told me too on a microsoft page but that tells me access denied too.&nbsp;<br />
and my account is under the administrator type.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've thought about factory defaulting my computer to see if that will restore it back to the way it was but I don't want to do that since I have a lot on this laptop.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything and still can not seem to get it to work...&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Imaging devices
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Disconnect each camera. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />Connect each camera then set it up. See instructions how to do that:

            tried this as well.... it did not pick up any issues. . . . I called MSI and they told me that i may have to factory default through the image burn software on the computer. . . but if that is the case then i might as well go back to windows 7 which is
 possible.&nbsp;<br />
I'd have to do it the hard way... but im tired of windows 10 and their BS...<br />
they should have never sent out this operating system with as much problems as it's got!

<br />
<br />Were you able to find a newer webcam driver or software on the MSI Support Downloads webpage for your model?  If so I'd try installing that.  It may even be the Unknown device - if you will click on it in Device Manager, then on the Details tab, dropdown the menu to Hardware ID, you can google the short string hardware ID and it will tell you what that unknown device is.  Post it back here along with the full MCI model number and we an help you more.
<br />
<br />Before you go back to Windows 7 since you would need to do a Clean Install anyway, I suggest trying a Windows 10 Clean Install.  No one who has done the Clean Install in this link who has come back with a single issue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />This is because factory and Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh which reinstalls Windows 10 while leaving out the Factory bloatware:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

Windows 10 Home 64 bit<br />

the model of the webcams I am not sure. . . My integrated says Microsoft but I can't seem to find the drivers online anywhere without an installation of a drivereasy, driver booster or etc.&nbsp;<br />
I have driver booster though.&nbsp;<br />

I'm thinking about purchasing a windows 7 ultimate disk and just factory resetting everything... as much as I hate to do this.&nbsp;<br />

but im unsure of it right now. because I'm currently in school and need it.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to install Windows 10 in a newly bought Surface Pro (processor i5). The system indicated that an update was available and I agreed to install it. It took around 3hours to download the 3Gbytes and now it has taken more than 8 hours for
 the installation, for the last 2 hours it has indicated on screen: 99% completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that normal?</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />In these cases, even if the progress percentage appears stuck, the upgrade is still running. An error message should be displayed in case of actual failure.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to please read this for more detailed information.

<p>
</p><p>If you use it often, you can right-click your desktop, point to "new" to create a shortcut, and put the command there so you have an icon for it.</p>

</p><p>I have the same issue as above.&nbsp; I have my original Skype account with my credit on it and all my contacts, and a new one, which appears to be linked to my Microsoft account, but which doesn't have all my profile data, call history, my credit or contacts.&nbsp;
 It is intensely frustrating as I use Skype for business and this transition is causing chaos.&nbsp; Please can someone hep me link the accounts?</p>

    <title>USB Mass Storage vanishing Kb on Windows 8&#47;10, but not on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendan merna  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Mass Storage vanishing Kb on Windows 8&#47;10, but not on Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with a bootloader program for a product with my company. The code designates the USB connected product to act as a Mass Storage Device with 64Kb of memory. This is important because the image to be loaded is exactly 64Kb. This process works perfectly
 for Windows 7. On Windows 8 and Windows 10 when looping at the properties of the Mass Storage Device there is 1Kb of (1024 bytes) of used space when the device should be completely free. I'm not sure where this mystery 1Kb comes from. Does anyone know the
 differences between Windows 7 and Windows 8/10 with regards to initializing a Mass Storage Device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make this problem even weirder I discovered that if the computer goes into Sleep mode and is woken up from Sleep mode. The the Mass Storage Device is fixed. It shows 64Kb of free space and the mysterious 1Kb is gone. What happens to the USB drive in sleep
 mode? Is there a reset that occurs that causes the computer to reread the correct storage space?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I unplug the USB and re plug it back it the problem returns. And is again fixed by a Sleep mode cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated! Thank you!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 and User Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelfitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and User Profile</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 SP1, Asus P5WD2 motherboard, with an Intel Pentium 4 Socket 775 LGA 955X, 3.8GHz CPU. The system has been OK for a couple of years but began slowing down over the last six months. I have done all the usual things like chkdsk, defrag,
 etc. After looking through all of the Microsoft help it mention looking at the user profile for corruption. To my surprise it has grown to 40.1GB in size and still growing. I tried creating a new user account and was going to copy my old profile to the new
 user. Unless I logged into the new user account once it didn't appear in the list or under the "c:\windows\user name". When I went to try and copy my current profile to the new user it was grayed out. Both accounts are set up as administrators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 help told me to do it manually after making the hidden files visible. I copied everything under the c:\Windows\User Name\My Documents except the .ini and .dat files. I got an error about a path being to long to copy and skipped it. Needless
 to say it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss as what to do next. If I start fresh I will be forced to send all of my password information under Norton to the cloud. I don't trust the cloud and won't do it. Beside that, I have a massive volume of needed programs installed and it would
 take me close to a week to get everything back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone make a suggestion as what I need to do? I am almost unable to even access the web or download files. The rest of my system is slow as well. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

            <p>Yes, I ran disk clean-up and defrag and every other clean-up known to man. I had this same issue about a year after I first installed Windows 7 Pro. I didn't think at that time to try and recreate the user profile so I just rebuilt the whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried safe mode and there was no change. As for the size not being too big, I have never had anything larger than 20GB at most. In fact when Windows stopped holding my folder settings (large icons) and coming up with detailed list, that's when the profile
 began to grow and things began to go crazy. I have been told by Microsoft that anything over 20GB is way too big so I'm confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I tried to plug in my laptop into my system as I have a small home network and I couldn't get it to connect. Whatever is wrong is preventing me from accessing the network and the web at times and when I do connect it takes forever to d/l anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About fours months ago I had a hard drive fail and was able to clone it to the new one. That decreased the user profile size to around 28GB. Also, I forgot to mention that the space on the C: drive is being depleted by something. On occasion the space will
 recover. It's usually the same amount of space that the user profile changes. I have a feeling that the profile has become corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why won't the system allow me to copy the profile to the new user account as Windows help says it will. It's simply greyed out.</p>

            <p>I wanted to let you know that I downloaded the file and it looks like the hog of the system is the Microsoft updates. Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary so now I'm wondering if I'm going down the wrong path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is that my web performance is suffering the worst. Perhaps some setting got changed. It took about 10 minutes to download that small "tree size free" file. I'm so frustrated right now that I'm ready to say the heck with it and just rebuild the
 system. It certainly would be faster than try to troubleshoot this. And no, my ISP is not throttling my service. That was first thing I checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not a corrupted user profile, does anyone have any suggestions? Again the part that is suffering the most is anything to do with the web. Sometimes it tells me it cannot find the server for "msn.com" and when I refresh it comes right up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a thought but could it be a hardware problem and not software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!! LOL</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looks like I just can't troubleshoot this issue. I'm going to have to wipe out and rebuild the system again. At least it has been more than two years since I had to do this. Even then, no one could figure it out.</p>
