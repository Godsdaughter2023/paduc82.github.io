<h2>            How can I install a fresh copy of Windows XP using my own product key&#63;</h2>
                    I have an older computer with preinstaled windows xp home edition,but don't have the disk to reinstall it, can I download fresh copy of windows and use my number from that computer?

            <p>firstly, it is unlikely you can download a fresh copy of windows xp since it is old and not sold anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if you could download a fresh copy of xp from an old site, then it would have its' own product key which is encoded in the setup files and requried to activate the o.s. after the installation..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you are thinking that you might be able to switch out the product keys, then this is not possible because the fresh product key is required to activate the fresh copy of the o.s. and you would have to&nbsp;buy that fresh&nbsp;o.s.&nbsp;to obtain its product key and
 activate the o.s..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if you did proceed to buy the fresh copy and the new product key, then trying to replace the new product key with the old one is not logical or necessary..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>perhaps, since your computer came pre-installed with xp, you might look up its make and model number on the internet and see if the factory that built it has any suggestions on re-storing the operating system on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>try looking up "factory restore" or "obtaining recovery disks" for you system.</p>

    <title>Error with bad block and shdocwv.dll on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craigjolley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error with bad block and shdocwv.dll on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After a Windows 10 auto-update a few weeks ago, my computer has never been the same. The first thing I noticed was that Windows Explorer would often crash when I double-clicked to open some file formats (especially PDF and XLSX), or when I attempted to move
 files by dragging them from one window to another. This never happened to me before the update, and began immediately afterward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Event Viewer, each crash is accompanied by a bunch of identical errors (in the "System" logs): "The device, \Device\Harddisk0\DR0, has a bad block." When I look in the "Application" logs, I also see that Windows was unable to access&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\shdocvw.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like the windows update caused shdocvw.dll to get moved onto a bad sector, and now seemingly simple operations crash Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I'm not the first person to get a bad block error; the advice I found
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/the-device-deviceharddisk0dr0-has-a-bad-block/2ce37433-3762-4f64-b4cc-ef866dd09115">
here</a> was to run chkdsk. After waiting a really long time, the problem seemed to be exactly the same as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also looked <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/chkdsk-stuck-hangs-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, where I was advised to run "sfc /scannnow", followed by "<span>Dism</span>&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth"; after waiting &gt;30min for dism to finish, it announced that it wasn't
 able to restore system health. Since my laptop is a Lenovo X220, I even tried downloading Lenovo's
<a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/lenovodiagnosticsolutions/tools/diagtools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
diagnostic tool</a>, which confirmed that I have a bad sector but declined to try and fix it "for safety reasons." (I'm guessing this means that the bad sector hosts important Windows files, like shdocwv.dll.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where do I go from here? I feel like the glitches are getting more frequent -- Windows now takes a really long time to start up, and when I check the event viewer I see the same bad block error coming up during the startup process. This is a persistent
 inconvenience, but nowhere near what I'll be looking at if my hard drive is on the verge of failure. My biggest concern is knowing whether I urgently need to start shopping for a new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Alas, it's been more than 10 days since the update, so it won't let me roll back. This is an old-ish laptop with only one physical hard drive, so just switching to a different HD would be non-trivial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of doing a system reset, but would want to back up some software first to make sure I don't lose anything that would be difficult to re-install.</p>

    <title>SoftAP WEP solution for Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjclarke4  say:</h3>
<h2>            SoftAP WEP solution for Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there, I'm new to these forums, but I'm really hoping for a solution to this problem:<br />
<br />
I'm desperately trying to find a way to host a wireless WEP network from my current wifi network. I'm on a Windows 7 laptop, and have the ability to host a WPA2 using the "<em>Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport adapter" &nbsp;</em><span>but unfortunately,
 I need a WEP network in order to connect with a Nintendo DS/DSi. The Nintendo WiFi USB Connector is discontinued and isn't supported for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I've scoured the internetz for a WEP solution, but it seems to be too outdated, which is understandable. If there isn't a virtual way of hosting such a network, I'm extremely open to buying any sort of USB dongle or peripheral device (other than an actual router).
 I'm looking for something simple enough that a child can know how to plug in to play, or unplug when done playing and I don't want to be consistently running a WEP from an additional router for security sake.<br />
<br />
Is this possible, with or without a device? And if there's devices that could simplify this, can you please recommend something specific, because "a USB dongle that supports SoftAP and WEP" is the only answer I see scattered across forums.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to answer this question once and for all, for the sake of all the DS users out there wanting to play online.<br />
Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer!</span>

<p>You want to host a wireless WEP network from the wifi network you are using.</p>

<p><span>This isn’t supported in Windows natively.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the best you could search for a device that supports the SoftAP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Third party software including hardware drivers may cause issues and you may not be able to start the computer. Using them is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You could change the wireless encryption to WEP but that might not be desirable since WEP is less secure than WPA/2.</span></p>

This is the same reply I've read on every forum. I'm thankful for the time you took to offer input, but could you please provide me with some examples of devices that may work? I haven't been successful with searching on my own, as this isn't a subject I fully
 understand. Any additional help would be appreciated! Thanks!

<p><br />
</p>
<p>WPA2/PSK in 7 is standard encryption, available in all bridge drivers. Doesn't matter if you use e.g. hostednetwork with ms wlan miniport or wn321g to broadcast your signal. It's all in drivers. So one and the only way is to try older drivers, which allow
 to use WEP. Installing XP drivers in compatibility mode (64/32) isn't an option, cause it won't work anyway. The only way is...&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows XP Mode via Virtual PC + your XP´s Drivers for your USB Wifi Adapter</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There's small catch. You must have a CPU with virtualization (some Intels and AMDs) to run MS Virtual PC. Also Windows XP Mode is downloadable only for 7 Pro/Ultimate/Enterprise (however there are methods to get it work on lower versions, just google it)<br />
<br />
So all we have to do is:<br />
1. Download and install VPC and WinXPMode from MS <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
website</a><br />
2. Run Windows XP Mode</p>
<p>3. Install USB Wifi Adapter drivers with a Wifi Manager utility (don't forget to turn on USB under virtual machine)</p>
<p>4. Run your Manager in AP mode and set up an access point (preferably open = no encryption or shared with WEP, it is also possible to turn on mac filtering)</p>
<p>5. You don't have to enter manually IPs, gateways etc. Your NDS should do it automatically, just find AP and enter WEP key (if one was set).<br />
6. And that's basically all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Also there are other virtual machines, not provided by MS, which doesn't need VT, however I haven't tried them out.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Acer Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers.<br />
<br />
Acer - USA - Service and Support - Drivers<br />
<a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support</a><br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />

<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
&nbsp;So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for Timeout Detection and Recovery. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and
 Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
<i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.<br />
<br />
2. Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
GPU testing: Furmark<br />
<br />
RAM&nbsp; testing: Memtest86+<br />
<br />
3. Corrupt hard drive or Windows install / OS install resulting in corruption to the registry or page file.<br />
<br />
HDD diagnostics: http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html<br />
<br />
To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:<br />
<br />
a ) Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
-Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
-then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
-then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
-then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
b ) In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
c ) Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
d ) Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
b ). Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
e ) Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Run System File Checker:<br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
-Incompatible drivers of any sort (either GPU, sound, etc)<br />
<br />
-Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
-Bad direct x files (uninstall, then reinstall DirectX)<br />
<br />
-bad system files (System File Checker - was run above)<br />
<br />
-Bad driver (some drivers will cause an event due to internal bugs, however these are not nearly as common as many think due to all of the previous things causing the same symptom) - (remove all 3rd party programs and check to be sure drivers aren't loading.
 Then install only the necessary 3rd party stuff, and ensure it's the latest version).<br />

<h2>            No sound randomly Windows 7 64-bit</h2>

                    <span><span><span><span>I have no audio in my computer. No sound from anywhere let it be Winamp, Windows Media Player, Youtube,
 system sounds, etc.<br />
<br />
-Sound is NOT muted.<br />
-Rebooting has not fixed the issue.<br />
-I installed and reinstalled the Realtek HD Audio driver.<br />
-System restore didn't fix the problem.<br />
<br />
There was an error screen one time when I tried shutting down my computer, but it disappeared before i could see what it said and on the next boot up, there was no sound.<br />
<br />
Everything in the computer says that the driver and sound is working. When I try to configure the speakers, it just says "Failed to play test tone."<br />
<br />
Someone told me to enter the BIOS to check for audio...not too sure how to enter it. When I press F2 to attempt to enter the BIOS, it just takes me to setup and there is no option to check for audio devices or anything. It just tells me things about booting
 up.<br />
<br />
I have a Sony VGN-FW510F/B. Realtek soundcard.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</span> </span></span></span>

            Hi AlecksShoe,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum site.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you installed 64-bit Win 7 the 32-bit driver absolutely will not install.&nbsp; You need 64-bit drivers for 64-bit Windows.&nbsp;
<br />
<strong><br />
You may uninstall the existing driver from device manager before installing the new one.</strong>
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel , clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the sound card, right click on it and select properties .<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to driver tab and click on Uninstall button to uninstall the driver associated with the device.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the uninstall completes, restart your computer and install the new driver which you downloaded from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
This should solve the sound problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Additional information:</strong> <br />

<h2>            Error 0x800F0908 in  Windows 10 Pro Build 1511</h2>
                    <p>I am a UK user. Why does Cortana work on my Windows 10 Home computer and not on my Windows 10 Pro after updating to Build 1511.</p>
<p>Both worked with the previous Build. Windows 10 Pro is now stuck with English USA Speach where it had both USA &amp; UK Languages, so I deleted the USA, (as I also did for my Windows 10 Home, which worked). Now Windows 10 Pro cannot download the UK settings
 to fix Cortana because of error code 0x800F0908.</p>

<h2>            3 Gift card orders stuck in progress</h2>
                    <p>I had over 22,000 points saved so i decided to redeem 6 $5 gift cards. I was successfully emailed 3 codes but 3 are stuck in progress in my order history. I just ended a call with xbox support and he confirmed that the 3 pending orders have actually failed on your end so i am stuck. I was told to post here about this to have it resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>I have also spent a silly amount of time on the phone trying to solve this so hopefully it all works out. Thanks<br /></p>

    <title>Help with Error&#58; &#34;Display driver stopped responding but has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tal_xi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with Error&#58; &#34;Display driver stopped responding but has recovered.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, my setup is a Dell XPS 7100, Windows 7 Home Prem. 64bit, Visiontek AMD Radeon HD&nbsp;6850 Video Card w/ version 9.2.0.0 driver,
</p>
<p>AMD Phenom II X6 cpu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that when I try to&nbsp;play any game (more specifically: Minecraft, SimCity, World in Conflict, AOE3)&nbsp;on Windows, the screen will freeze for about 5 seconds then go black for 1 second then come back up with an error message saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Display driver stopped responding but has recovered</strong></p>
<p>Display driver AMD driver stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This only started after I upgraded my video card from a AMD HD 5670&nbsp;to a Visiontek AMD Radeon HD&nbsp;6850, which at the same time&nbsp;I upgraded my&nbsp;power supply&nbsp;to a 500w unit like AMD recommends. After this occurred I updated all my drivers, deleted and reinstalled
 the video driver and that did not help. I then searched all the forums talking about this problem and found that it is more than likely&nbsp;a problem with Windows Power&nbsp;Management.&nbsp;So I followed the instructions from this site to change the registry data to help
 with this. This did not work, the&nbsp;same problem at the same times. I then contacted&nbsp;AMD Support and they pretty much told me it was either the power supply or windows power management that was causing the crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a loss now, I'm not sure what to do. I haven't tried any third party programs to try and manage the&nbsp;power.&nbsp;But if anyone has used one that works or has any ideas for me to try&nbsp;please let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I've found a fix that helps! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make a backup of the registry before doing any editing in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When editing the registry go to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</li><li>then HARDWARE</li><li>then DEVICEMAP</li><li>then VIDEO</li><li>within the "VIDEO" file there is an entry with the title: MaxObjectNumber - REG_DWORD</li><li>this has a value at the end that looks like 0x00000006 (6) or 0x00000005 (5)</li><li>double click on MaxObjectNumber and an edit box comes up</li><li>put&nbsp;0 into the Value Data&nbsp;and click OK.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will disable Windows GPU Timeout Detection and Recovery. Which stopped it from crashing on me.&nbsp; The only problem is that windows does not save this and it will reset after the next reboot so it must be changed everytime you start up the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to save the changes to the registry, I would be very thankful for your advice.</p>

            <p>hey Kadir,</p>
<p>you need to go to AMD's website in order to get the drivers.</p>
<p>go to</p>
<p>support.amd.com.</p>
<p>Or additionally, you can download a driver Pack solution like software which detects and installs drivers in your system automatically.However it needs a 4GB+ hard drive space to run.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Monitor driver disabled after upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Win 10 Pro x64 my two Dell Monitor drivers are disabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c428273b-72d7-4351-9124-31146fb59bd1" /></p>
<p>They can be enabled easily enough, but on the next reboot will be disabled again. The monitors function, but Spyder5 Pro calibration data can not load and the software returns an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uninstall and delete the drivers and then search for new hardware, the drivers will reinstall. All is fine until the next reboot.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that installing the display adapter drivers did not help.
</span><span>Normally these issues are caused if the updated drivers are not installed OR if the recent Windows updates are not installed.</span></p>

            All that "stuff" is taken care of. Dell says "not officially supported", which on some level is understandable - but still annoying. The computer has functioned for an entire 4 years.

            <p>It seems that I solved the problem on my computer. Before installing my old graphics card back as a last resort I tried the Display driver uninstaller (DDU) from Guru3D.com. I ran it in safe-mode and was surprised to see it detected AMD drivers still on
 the computer although I had uninstalled them from the "Programs and features". I ran the DDU and it removed the remains of the AMD drivers. After multiple boots my monitor driver stays enabled in the task manager and also the color calibration settings stay
 in effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This implies that there might be a driver conflict somewhere that causes the problem. In my case, it was the transition from AMD to Nvidia that caused the issue. It is also possible that Windows 10 with its automatic driver updates might have something to
 do with this, although I have the updates disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is that you should run the DDU and do a clean install of the display drivers. It might just work.</p>

            My PC is custom built by myself. My motherboard is an Asus Rampage IV Extreme. However, you seem to have misunderstood my question, specifically:
<div><br />
<div>"SecureBoot is supported but disabled on my motherboard as I boot into operating systems/bootloaders that don't support UEFI or even SecureBoot therefore enabling secure boot is not an option."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have intentionally disabled and have no intention of turning on SecureBoot. I want the watermark removed, I am fully aware of what SecureBoot is and it is not appropriate for how I use my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft has no place in forcing me to enable SecureBoot nor do I need a silly message on the desktop. All I want to know is how to disable this watermark without turning on SecureBoot.</div>

            They are not going to get back to you on that. Like always once you tell them what you want to do that is not their policy forget it. You need to search yourself online to do it. They won't help.......

            It's funny how the "Expert" looks like he completely missed the whole idea of your post, that we disabled it intentionally to boot other operating systems. We realize that anything that happens to our system is out of your hands when we customize it like
 that, but this is stupid. At least give us a reg fix or some instructions on where to disable it in regedit (WE'RE COMPETENT! WE PROMISE!).

            <p>This problem seems to be applicable to many PC brands. I have a&nbsp;Toshiba laptop.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even I have a new PC that came with preinstalled Windows 8 (I hate), I also intentionally disabled Secure Boot, and I had no problem until I upgraded to 8.1 (for only one main reason -- to get a START Button, boot directly to Desktop (without seeing those
 ugly tiles),&nbsp;and being able to disable those&nbsp;annoying all the time unexpectedly popping side charms (or whatever MS calls them).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want that watermark to be removed, and I have no intention to enable Secure Boot. If&nbsp;my PC was able to&nbsp;work under Windows&nbsp;8 with a&nbsp;disabled Secure Boot, it should&nbsp;work under Windows 8.1 the same way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, Microsoft, when do you address the issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am glad that I did not upgrade another ASUS PC to 8.1, because it is nothing worse that having the issue that cannot be fixed (to our liking).</p>

UNACCEPTABLE answer,<br />

We know what secure boot is, and we CHOOSE not to enable it. Personally I find the message on my desktop rather aggressive. So my response will be aggressive. REMOVE IT !<br />

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.

<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

<h2>            Broadcom and Windows 10 issues</h2>
                    <p>Each time Windows 10 updates, it disables my TP-Link network adapter and reenables the Broadcom wi-fi adapter on my HP desktop.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; How can I stop this from happening??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:&nbsp; When I allowed windows 10 to be installed on my HP desktop my network issues began.&nbsp; Subsequently, I discovered the issue</p>
<p>to be the Broadcom Wi-Fi Adaper integrated into my HP desktop, it apparently is not compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I disabled the Broadcom Adapter</p>
<p>and installed a TP-Link Network Adapter - and network now works perfectly.</p>

    <title>Multiple Xbox Live Accounts on Same Email &#40;Conflicting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Xbox Live Accounts on Same Email &#40;Conflicting Accounts&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, so I seem to be having a bit of a problem with my Xbox Live Gold account. Y'see, waaay back when, I purchased Age of Empires III through Microsoft marketplace on the day it was for sale for $0.10. And as such, it required me to make a (silver) Live
 account on the computer. So, I did, using my email. And so, I ended up with the account I'm currently using to create this post: "SizedFoot877940". No problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast Forward about 5 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an Xbox 360 (yay!) and 3 months of Gold. So, when I start it all up, I have to make an account on my Xbox/use the one from before that I had online. Makes sense. But for some reason, it says that there is no such account. Huh. Nothing at all. So I
 use the same email to make a different account, "ArmoredSun192". Time passes and I enjoy Live quite a bit, no issues to speak of. HOWEVER. For some reason, since about December on, there seems to be an issue- my hard drive in other Xbox consoles does not recognize
 my login information. Whenever I turn it on and try to log in, it prompts me for my email and password. No problem, right? THEN it says my login information is incorrect. I know the information is correct, I have it written down clearly, [and I even tried
 various other things that it somehow might've been]. No luck. So the only way I can use my hard drive is in MY console. Otherwise, no Xbox Live for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then when I try to log in on this site to get help, it comes up as my free "SizedFoot" account (with the SAME email and password) and doesn't recognize my Gold account (the ArmoredSun) one at. All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the two emails I sent to Support have basically come back saying "Sorry Sir, &nbsp;but what you describe isn't possible. And/or we don't know what it is."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does <em>ANYONE</em>&nbsp;else out there have a similar experience? Any possible solutions/suggestions? Thanks for your time, everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">What you will need to do is use another e-mail for the account you do not use as much. Then once you change that you should have no issues logging in with the correct account. If you do you may want to contact phone support so
 the can assist you further. Remember only one account per e-mail address. Otherwise you end up with issues such as this.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response, just a couple of questions: 1) how do I change emails? I can't seem to find it on this site despite looking around a fair bit, and 2) when I *originally* signed up for the Gold account, how come it didn't recognize my email address
 as already being linked to an existing Windows Live ID after I entered it as prompted? (which is what caused all this to begin with)</p>
<p>Again, thanks for all the help!</p>

<p>Hey there Foot! First, if you need to change your WLID, please follow the steps found in this Guide (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/t/153168.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../153168.aspx</a>). That said,
 can you simply let us know what you would like to accomplish here. Do you want to use your original account (Foot) or your new account (Sun)? If we understand where you want to go, we can help you get there. Let us know, thanks!

<p>With regards to the first solution, I cannot do that because my hard drive wont let me connect to Live to begin with. But I see what youre getting at.
</p>
<p>Anyway, what I'm trying to accomplish is I want to be able to use my new account (ArmoredSun192) and fix whatever error is keeping it from accessing Live when in other consoles. Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Hey Sized, so when you try and log in with the information that's logged under both this account and ArmoredSun, you're being told your login info is incorrect? It won't bring up any account at all? Also, have you tried calling phone support as suggested
 earlier, to have them confirm what email is listed on the account? They should be able to do so once you provide the necessary account information. :-)

<p>Im having a similar problem. This account "CloakingJet" is a ghost account; it has no information on it what so ever but it has been tagged to my email and now takes priority over my acctual account on this same email address. I want to be able to view my
 actual profile since it has all my downloads on it but for some reason I can't figure out how to change it. I want to get off CloakingJet and back to my main.

<p>hey there maredvirus62, &nbsp;these forums work best if you build your own thread. &nbsp; if you are entering in an email address and password and it's taking you to THIS gamertag then you are using the correct credentials for it. &nbsp;If you were expecting a different
 gamertag then you will need to learn the email and password that belong to it somehow.</p>
