<h2>            Do you have to have full windows 7 to download Cyberlink Youcam&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I brought a laptop with 3 a little while ago, and they told me there was Windows 7 on it, but didn't tell me it was only Windows 7 starter but it's not that bad as it's only for school work, and I don't really want to buy full Windows 7 if I don't
 need it at the moment, and I would like to know if I need to buy full Windows 7 to get full Cyberlink Youcam, as they also didn't tell me that it was only a trial Cyberlink :/ anyone to help?

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

<h2>            System_threat_exception_not_handled &#40;dxgmms2.sys&#41; ERROR ON NEW PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I bought a laptop from HP Pavilion in a store in Andorra (with, obviously, a Spain provider). Since day one, the screen of my laptop turned blue and gave an error which said (I'm translating this from spanish to english, so it won't be exactly
 the same):</p>
<p>
</p><p>:(</p>
<p>An error was been produced on your PC and must restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're going to recopilate some informationabout the error and then the PC will restart automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to search for information of the error later on:&nbsp;System_threat_exception_not_handled (dxgmms2.sys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I did, was stopping the automatic updates microsoft does, this didn't stop the error. Then, my father restored the PC, &nbsp;this didn't stop the error either. Finally, I took my laptop to the shop where I bought it, where the error didn't appear,
 but they found two random "errors" which they "fixed".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't go to the shop next week, but my laptop needs a solution fast. Â¿What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much, have a nice day.</p>

                    <p>So i got home from work today get on my xbox to see that I have a message saying I got suspended. Come to find out that I have been suspended for something I did in looking for group posts. Confused I remember that I can check my posting history and not one of my post nor any post I showed intrest in said anything inappropriate. I tried to file a case review and of course I cant. I know that if the ban is 24 hours that you cant so can someone tell me if it is just a 24 hour ban or if there is a way I can check. I have been everywhere looking for answer. I dont have access to the email tied to this account because I didn't think I would need to. please dont respond with check the xbox live enforcement because every post you guys reply to is that so can someone please provide some useful information. now im very livid about this so please dont do what I know youre going to do and just try to redirect me to the enforcement page thank you.</p>

                    today I cannot get onto some websites no matter what browser I try.&nbsp; Other friends are able to get on, so the sites are not down.&nbsp; I have tried system restore but that did not help, cleared cache and cookies...still no help.

    <title>Failed Cumulative WUs -Is the current approach for helping Users - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Failed Cumulative WUs -Is the current approach for helping Users &#34;fit for purpose&#34;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Iâm one of many users who have experienced major problems with the failure of Windows Updates, usually Cumulative ones. For example, the December Cumulative Update for Win10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (failed twice) and the October Cumulative Update
 for Win10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems. The January 2016 Cumulative Updates completely screwed up my Win10 (free/forced upgrade from Win7 and I also major problems with the Anniversary Update in August 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems appear to me to have hit users across the spectrum â users with different makes of PC, different OS Builds and versions â Iâve only seen Win7 and Win10 problems but Iâd bet others too have been affected - and with different Security/Firewall
 products (not just McAfee and Norton that some are blaming). Further, the failure of those updates have also affected other MS products such as Edge and Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluntly these issues must have been programming faults - not run-of-the-mill problems that should be dealt with via individual threads.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iâm simply a User, not an expert, but itâs obvious to me that the current procedures for getting help have failed. Some Users have added their complaint to an existing thread eg
</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/cumulative-update-for-windows-10-version-1067-for/80d9bef1-f959-4ca1-ad15-309087fd24b9">Cumulative Update KB3206632</a>&nbsp;and (edited at 11:01 to check this link:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/update-kb3206632-stuck/394260ce-3137-4089-8571-859cae8927df">
Update KB3206632 stuck.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Users there, myself included, felt it was sensible to group our problems together but if you dare to do that you get a curt âCreate your own threadâ reply (usually followed by a request to the Moderators to split it off to a new thread&nbsp;plus unfair.unprofessional&nbsp;criticism
 of those who have posted eg we are&nbsp;no more than "Me, too! F*** Microsoft!" gripersâ.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how can it possibly help to force Users to create their own threads? Search for KB3206632 and you'll see at least fifty users saying the WU won't install - on the first screen alone three of the twenty have had no reply and it gets worse on later pages.
 Creating separate threads simply lengthens the queue of âhelp neededâ and increases the number of threads to which no expert replies.
</p>
<p>And bear in mind Iâve only looked at Win10 problems with KB3206632 â now many more similar threads are here with no reply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, the solution is for the Moderators/Forum Owners to create a thread in such instances as this when there is such a major problem caused by programming flaws, as they did with the Missing Start Menu/Cortana issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Bear in mind that in a few monthsâ time we should expect the Windows 10 Creators Update âalso known as Redstone 2.
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/278132/whats-new-in-windows-10s-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
3D and many new features!</a>&nbsp; Will that go without any problems? = more individual threads created?]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So </strong><strong>please reply here to let the FOs/FMs know if you agree with the current âCreate your own individual threadâ or whether you too would like to see a single FO/FM thread created.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know they are extremely busy at the moment what with personnel changes and the current dreadful performance problems with the Community but we do need their help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Are any of you still having problems with failed WUâs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited rather late (16:21) to say (Edited&nbsp;at 23:40 25th Jan to strikethrough the following.&nbsp;For those who haven't been following Performance Problems - see link below -&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Reply with quote"&nbsp;appears to have been mainly fixed:)&nbsp;&nbsp;<del><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>When
 you reply, please do not use the Reply with Quote, especially at the present time when you're likely to see from 2 to 13 copies of the reply!!</strong></span></del>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and also to mention that underneath my thread it says that "I and someone else have recommended it". I
<strong>didn't</strong> do that - that's dishonest. It's the crazy new process that's just been introduced.

            <p>OK, Since I last checked in, I got into a Microsoft Chat session, with a Microsoft Engineer.&nbsp; He took control of my PC (the one that is failing).&nbsp; This is what he did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; First, he removed TEMP files (%TEMP% under RUN) and removed them all but two of them that could not be deleted. I observed this entire routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; PREFETCH was also invoked under RUN and those files were deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened SERVICES.MSC and found two processes that needed to be RESTARTED.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this is where I was lost as I got a phone call right in the middle of this procedure, unfortunately, but he did invoke CRYPTOGRAPHIC services for one.&nbsp; There was one
 other service that he RESTARTED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN, we went into UPDATE and RAN the update again and it failed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my latest:&nbsp;&nbsp; Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3213986) - Error 0x800703f1</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, now note that my KB number has changed to KB3213986.&nbsp; I do not wish to start another thread as my original complaint was not this number but the 6632 one, the one that is being discussed here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I asked the Engineer for a link to get back with him next week so he can take another look and possibly find my issue.&nbsp; When I see that happen, and HOPEFULLY we get one to stick, then I will be back here with another report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the type who NEVER gives up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will keep pushing and pushing until my Acer PC updates and sticks!</p>

            <p>I don't consider myself an "expert", though I prefer to be in the helper, rather than helpee, category.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the usual ( <em>update auto-restarts freeze the system at the **** stage and I have to kick it a few times to get it going again: probably related to a botched dual-boot setup, and I'll fix it eventually, no worries</em> ) I haven't had any insurmountable
 problems with updates apart from prefering to do it myself rather than letting the machine decide when and how. (<em>hack-fixed by "metered connection" to stop autoupdating.&nbsp; That's a copout, though</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think you'll find that most of the "experts" have things in common:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- installed clean rather than an upgrade</p>
<p><em>With an upgrade you're inheriting any hidden problems and anomalies from the previous installation, including settings and hacks which might have been useful then, but aren't now</em></p>
<p>- don't rely on 3rd party AV's</p>
<p>- don't rely on 3rd party disk/registry cleaners</p>
<p><em>As well intentioned as they may be, both are by definition invasive (Mcafee and Norton are featured rather prominently in troubleshooting because they're the most common bundled programs)</em></p>
<p>- unlikely to install crapware</p>
<p>- keep up with system maintenance</p>
<p>- backup anything that isn't easily replaceable or reproduceable</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which means that they don't generally have issues in the first place, and anything that does crop up is more of an annoyance than a problem.</p>

            <p>Yes, Pa Bear, one of the Pro's here, had me run Mcafee and Norton cleaners..even though I am a user that NEVER invokes Norton or Mcafee and in fact, I remove them immediately upon initial boot-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I ran those cleaners, re-booting according to the instructions from Pa, and STILL I am seeing the failures.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To give custom diagnosis to develop custom answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;If everyone is adding their different details and expecting it to be analyzed just for them it becomes ridiculous and (often) does a disservice to the OP.&nbsp; It probably helps to have a single thread where
 users can add their Me too! to discuss and collaborate without expecting any other help.&nbsp; I would agree that sometimes such possibilities get derailed by good intentioned "splitting".&nbsp; E.g. if you come upon a thread that you think applies to you and would
 like to collaborate with the OP, it would probably be best to be circumspect about your case's details when "helping".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

            <p>I would prefer a single repository for each KB Failure (does that make sense?)...I am beginning to understand that there may be (possibly???) many W10 versions out there, which if if true, leads me to believe that MS is out of control.&nbsp; So long as I have
 sufficient:&nbsp; a) Disk space&nbsp;&nbsp; b) CPU&nbsp; c) Ram&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then why not have ONE version of W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be confused on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my interactions with PA Bear when NO WHERE FAST so I started searching the Community forums and came across your and may others' experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally WHY is there not a FORMAL MICROSOFT Engineer on this&nbsp; for we users having this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; OR, are community experts ACTUALLY MS employees or are people like PA BEAR spending his personal time **UNPAID**???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really interested as a Power User, as I use my Networked W10 PC's to make a living.&nbsp; I am not an idle browser, reading up on The Election or using Facebook to peruse Pics and Ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my PC's to trade Futures and Options, so I MUST have updated and secured PC's as I am on for hours at a time.</p>

            <p>thank you RickT, DJ and Robert Aldwinckle. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rick - I can see the difference in quality of User/more professional approach and why experts are likely to have far fewer problems but this laptop was a clean, made for Windows PC. I don't visit dubious sites, always searching using Norton to rate any site
 I'm thinking of looking at and SuperAntiSpyware Free does a brilliant job of stopping crapware. But I've still had major failed Cumulative Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DJ &amp; Robert: I can understand why with a 'normal' problem, it's good to check out the User's individual PC such as checking Norton &amp; McAfee. I'll be the first to publicly&nbsp;thank PA Bear for finding out that a major issue I was having last year was caused
 by a McAfee free trial that I didn't even know I had. All I'm saying is that when there is a major programming problem - as these clearly are - then a single thread works better for the reasons that Robert has mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to be honest and challenge something I've just said -<em> "when there is a major programming problem - as these clearly are".</em> If these are programming problems, wouldn't that also affect the experts or might it be that they're all probably
 Insiders and so use Builds/versions far ahead of ours?</p>

<p>
</p><p>THIS is a great question and I doubt we will see an answer to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have actually considered applying to be an insider so I can have SOME input as to which version I am allowed or can download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The assumption I have here is that insiders might be able to secure insider help?</p>

            <p>yup, you're a little "confused on this".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pro and Enterprise have a couple more programs than Home, a couple of the licensing and Activation settings are different for Education, Charity, OEM, System Builder, Full Retail, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that they're the same: the real difference is for different categories of processors: x64(64bit) and x86(32 bit).&nbsp; So there's only two "varieties" of OS at a machine level : the one for x86 and the one for x64.&nbsp; And x86 stuff will generally run
 on x64, so there's some overlap as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, there is only one Windows10.&nbsp; The version and build numbers are chronological in nature.&nbsp; If you can get the CU to install you'll be at version 1607 (refers to the Anniversary Update), build 14393.693, same as me (and everybody else).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(okay, I lie: the smartphone versions are different, but all desktops/laptops/tablets are the same)</p>

<h2>            Photo Viewer displays In High Contrast Needs Fixed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I noticed the Windows Photo Viewer in Windows 8 has a white background in high contrast mode, it needs to be a black background as it was in previous versions. It defeats the purpose of high contrast when viewing pictures which hopefully can be corrected
 at some point. thanks</p>

            Im not sure you understand the problem, the background color of windows photo viewer does not change from white regardless of the color I set the background to. To test it, set windows background to any high contrast (black, most are black backgrounds)
 and open a picture in windows photo viewer, thats it. You should see white around the picture even with a high contrast black background, which is wrong as it should have a black fill around the picture instead of white.

    <title>Windows have small gaps between edges of screen and each other when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> subject096  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows have small gaps between edges of screen and each other when using edge snapping</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated Windows 10 to the most recent version. After doing so I have noticed that when using edge snapping to displays two windows sides by side that the windows for some applications have a small gap between them and the edges of the screen and
 each other. This is most notable with Google Chrome and the Setting app.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74ddf86e-9688-4a4b-959b-c65e3a87aa6c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74ddf86e-9688-4a4b-959b-c65e3a87aa6c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 on a Mac using Bootcamp and have made sure that my display drivers are up to date.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pixel gap between snapped windows in Windows 10, is by design, to let the users easily resize windows. If there is a variance in the gap from
 one application to another, it could be due to the invisible application borders. You may want to adjust the
<strong>border padding</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry
 before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. To backup and restore registry key, refer to

            Your suggestion to edit the registry didn't solve the problem. I also have never had a problem resizing windows before this gap started appearing. This also doesn't explain why this is only a problem with certain applications. I did submit log a feedback
 report in the feedback hub as you suggested.

<p>Hi <strong>Morgana Vhidow</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, can you tell us if you have third party antivirus software installed on your PC? If so, try to temporarily disable it, run the game and see if it helps. There are some instances that anti-virus software blocks or prevent ads from happening,
 and this may be the cause of the issue. Try it out and let us know the outcome.&nbsp; Reply to this post so I will get notified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

                    Although Windows 10 printer drivers have installed properly the Epson r320 refuses to print on a Cd/Dvd. Epson do not have any drivers for Windows 10 and they say the OS automatically installs them. I am reduced to keeping an XP computer just to print
 on CD/Dvd's with this printer.

            Yes. I have the Cd print program installed. When i click print, it says the printer driver is not installed. This was the same error when using Windows 7 and a manual print solved this problem. However with Windows 10 this fix doesn't work.

<p>Well after a day of trying to get my son to log into Xbox live with no joy, no help from support site and unable to speak to technical, finally got him on tonight, by taking&nbsp; work around&nbsp;instructions from a 12 year old girl.</p>
<p>Poor information on Microsoft's and Xbox site, absolutely shocking support, but that's what happens with a company as big as them. A complacent attitude towards there loyal customers (in my opinon)&nbsp;poor poor poor.</p>
<p>Funny how they can send adds and rubbish you don't want but cannot send everyone an email to say there is a problem!! Now looking for a playstation to run alongside to compare and if its better bye bye xbox</p>

<p>What was your workaround? I am tired of this problem! 2 days ago when my son tried to log in, he got a message that said he needed a parent to authorize his access to Xbox Live. This after having no problems for months. I went through the process of authorizing
 him only to run into the next issue where it said my account was invalid. So I then went through the process of trying to change my account and entered all of the information only to get an error when submitting my information hat their system wasn't available.
 This is absolutely ridiculous! I know they did a change because I did get a message saying they have a problem with child account logging in after a system update. But nothing new on that issue. I'm curious what you did as a workaround?</p>

<p>On your sons account go through the process of entering the email and confirm password. When the error message 8318853 comes comes up, press the xbox button on the controller quickly (less than half a second). This takes you back to normal screen. He will
 not be signed into live but then go to play a game, it will then promt to sign in, enter the email and password and when you get the error code screen press the xbox button on controller briefly (less than half second) it should then go back to the game where
 you be signed in. Bear in mind untill this is fixed he will have to do this everytime he turns on the box. Hope it works for you.</p>

<p>Hi there Rikkidees! </p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that you were having trouble with the child account system. Feedback for the support articles is best left at the "Feedback" link from the bottom of Xbox.com.
</p>
<p>This said, perhaps I could provide some guidance for users experience similar issues. Was the "8318853" error the only one you were getting? Also, is your son able to log into
<a href="https://account.xbox.com?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com?</a> There may be an issue with the terms of use. Are you able to try any other accounts on the console? If the child's account is new and nothing seems to be resolving
 the issue, there may be a glitch on the account itself. The best step for a resolution on account specific issues would be to reach Microsoft Account support here:
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=306268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
go.microsoft.com/fwlink</a>.</p>
<p>If the account is new, it may be easier to simply make a new account for the child. I always recommend creating the account from
<a href="http://signup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://signup.live.com</a> (you need to be logged out for that to work), this way no information on the account is skipped. You can have the new account sign into Xbox.com from there and it should
 begin the process of generating the Xbox Live profile. Note that children under the age of 13 may have difficulty participating in Xbox Live, I think this has to do with Federal Child Safety laws but I'm not 100% sure on that.</p>

    <title>Some characters replaced by symbols &#40;&#65533;&#41; in Windows mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex &#40;e.t.&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some characters replaced by symbols &#40;&#65533;&#41; in Windows mail app</h2>
                    I am troubleshooting a Windows Mail issue for a family member.<br />
Windows Mail seems to be unable to decode some characters and replaces them with symbols like &nbsp;ï¿½ in many received mails. The problem is mostly in sender names and email subjects but does also&nbsp;affect the body of some received mails. I have so far confirmed that
 the problem is in windows mail and does not manifest itself in Outlook which seems to be able to handle character encoding/decoding with no issues. The junk characters basically replace letters with accents in french (Ã©ÃÃ¨ÃÃ§Ã¢ etc.) and does not affect all mails
 (i assume this is dependent on the encoding used by the senders). I have also replicated the issue in a VM with the windows 8.1 evaluation freshly installed. As Windows Mail seems incredibly basic and I am unable to find any options regarding encoding (UTF-8
 etc) I am at a loss as to what to do to help this person as currently the only solution I have to offer is for them to use Outlook instead of Windows Mail and i know they enjoy the interface of the mail app.<br />
<br />
<br />
re-installing the app or removing the account does not help (also obvious since problem replicated on fresh install)<br />
Is there a patch/fix or a hidden option i might have missed ?<br />
Please let me know if another thread i might not have seen contains a solution. I have seen some similar problems in some old threads but never a solution regarding the Windows mail app

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that you have an issue with your Windows mail app.</p>
<p>This issue might have occurred because of Mail app corruptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I need some information in order to go ahead.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2. Which email account have you configured with Windows mail app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that mail app will not be able to decode certain Unicode symbol as this feature is not available on mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that, this problem occurs mostly in sender names and email subjects.</p>
<p>I suggest you to send an email to a different email account or to your own email account and then try to access your email account on web using web browser and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods to check if it resolves the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p>Run the Windows 8.1 App Troubleshooter. </p>
<p>The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>I would suggest you to update the mail app from Windows store.</p>
<p>Refer to the link given below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/automatic-app-updates-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/automatic-app-updates-help</span></a></span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you are busy and I appreciate your reply. Please read my first post again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will re-iterate a few points more clearly :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No changes were made other than Automatic updates being enabled on the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstalling the mail app and re-installing it did not resolve the issue. Also, I have mentioned that i replicated the problem on a fresh install of windows in a virtual machine. The problem is therefore not restricted to one install being corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Installing all updates did not resolve the problem, &nbsp;The apps are set to auto-update. There are no updates available for the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The mail account configured is IMAP for a Cogeco account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have used webmail and everything looks fine there. something seems to be going wrong during the message sync in the mail app. It might be how the mail server is transmitting the mails...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- As i said everything looks perfect in Outlook. The problematic characters are nothing special, simply accents in french...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have actually already tried the app troubleshooter, of course it did not find any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time</p>

    <title>Intel 2600k, ran beautifully until an update, can&#39;t roll back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swingchop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel 2600k, ran beautifully until an update, can&#39;t roll back drivers</h2>
                    <p>I was overjoyed with the performance of my 5 year old Sandy Bridge processor, It's playing even the most intense games (Star Citizen)&nbsp;coupled with an Nvidia 680, thanks to Windows10.&nbsp; I saw roughly a 30% increase in performance, and for the first time, I
 had seen 4k graphics in the same game getting 30fps, 80fps on 1080. &nbsp;Sometime after 5 August, an "update" broke my HD3000 drivers, and now I have trouble running even moderately active games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Driver Download 2.2 is futile; uninstalling, loading old drivers, also no luck.&nbsp; Before I installed Windows10, the scan said I was good to go.&nbsp; I guess that's not the case.&nbsp; Intel says they will not support windows 10 on the Sandy Bridge, because it
 is too old.&nbsp; This chip still clocks better than all but the newest Skylake.&nbsp; </p>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-034343.htm</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>This sleight of hand is absurd.&nbsp; The consumer is left holding their tech, while Intel and MS are pointing the finger at each other.&nbsp; Intel has been known to use planned obsolescence, but this chip is still going very strong.&nbsp; To make matters worse, configuring
 Windows to NOT update a driver has confounded me, despite searching forums and google.&nbsp; LGP.exe, control panel settings, and regedit all fail.&nbsp; The worst case is regedit, which has an option to load into&nbsp;the old control panel "windows update"(which allowed
 choosing updates) but that key is locked, and admin can't even access it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found 3rd party drivers, beta drivers, &nbsp;or at least an article saying Intel will in fact make good on their promise to support the Sandy Bridge on windows10?&nbsp; Intel 15.28.24.64.429 current install.&nbsp; I've tried drivers I had saved all the way back
 to 2010.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a "learning curve" issue, and this is not from a neophyte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest version of Skype is worse than bad.&nbsp; It's completely unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There aren't enough synonyms in the dictionary to describe how bad this update is.&nbsp; And it's not just me saying so.&nbsp; Everyone I know.&nbsp; All my STUDENTS are completely at a loss as to how to make the D**** thing work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TERRIBLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have de-installed it, and re-installed an old version.&nbsp; I've turned off the auto-update feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm really, seriously PLEADING WITH YOU.&nbsp; DO NOT force me to use the new updated version.&nbsp; If you do, I will be forced to switch to FaceTime, Viber, VSee, UberConference...ANYTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TWO DIXIE CUPS AND A LONG STRING WOULD WORK BETTER THAN SKYPE V.8</p>

<p>Quite right.&nbsp; I sent Microsoft a similarly scathing comment from the new version.&nbsp; I can never understand why people keep trying to fix things that ain't broken.&nbsp; Fix a bug by all means, but otherwise leave things alone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is a useful communications platform, which doesn't need to be dumbed down to resemble an iPad app designed for eight year olds!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never before have I come across such an incomprehensible piece of software, which has also had many useful features removed, and added an interface which demands more clicking to find and do anything than was needed before.&nbsp; What were these designers thinking
 of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very little in this new version is intuitive and, many times, it fails to work properly, leaving a blank blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, the classic version is still available.&nbsp; I downloaded that, disconnected from the internet, installed the classic version, disabled the auto-update feature, and then reconnected.&nbsp; Phew.&nbsp; That worked (so far!).</p>

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised there are so many like-minded impressions of the new **** Skype version for Mac! It took me a couple of days to hate it completely, uninstall it and re-install the latest decent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's beyond my understanding why would you need to gut rich settings of the old version for a few colorful meaningless settings menu of the new vesion! There is no longer auto answer for video calls (which was very convenient for my old mom) and no longer
 screen/desktop sharing (to help my brother with compueter problems). The new version clutters the view immensely: it creates empty chat sessions for every single person or multiperson call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent Microsoft an email full of expletives! How can you be so dumb and disrespectful to your customers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am back to the old version. Enough of innovation from Microsoft. Just as Windows 8 was a disaster so is Skype v8.</p>

<p>Whenever my computer goes haywire I wonder wtf I have done and tend to panic! &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, relieved in a way to read all your comments above with which I agree wholeheartedly. &nbsp;I have several kids and lots of friends living abroad and we used Skype quite a bit - it was so easy to use.</p>
<p>Microsoft designers are nothing short of idiots in this instance and the Managers need to be asking the design department WHY did they do this? &nbsp;I strongly suspect to justify the Design Departments billing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone from Microsoft ever read and respond to these comments?????</p>

            By the way, everyone: thank you for your comments.&nbsp; I have been experimenting with ZOOM (zoom.us) at the advice of a colleague.&nbsp; It its heads and above better quality in almost all respects to Skype.&nbsp; It is tailored specifically for business purposes.&nbsp;
 In the event we're forced into updates of Skype that are tailored more for teenagers sending emojis, this seems to be an excellent alternative.
