<h2>            Parental control support needed.</h2>
                    
<p>My younger brother, in his infinite wisdom, created a new account on my 360 (original. As in, I got it when the xbox 360 was less than two months off the press) while I was on holiday (and by holiday, I mean living with my uncle for two months) using an
 e-mail account he created on the fly, never expecting to need it (he was using one of the free months that come with the xbox). He allegedly had threats of someone "hacking" him on xbox live and panicked so much that he instantly set up parental controls using
 that account, subsequently forgetting that password as well.</p>
<p>Here's where it gets better. At the end of his month of live, he decided to create another account (my xbox only ever had my account made on it, so it still had a few free family accounts left on it) only to find it was blocking him from doing so, requiring
 him to put in a code he's forgotten, and then asking his to reset that code with another password he'd also forgotten (apparently the answer to his favourite fictional character was a string of random letters - so that nobody can ever guess it. My brother
 is obviously a genius at creating codes, because even he can't crack them.). During his panic, he decided that he'd try and reformat his hard-drive (he'd kept using his hard-drive on my xbox, using my xbox only for the free live). Now no one even knows how
 to get back on to his account, nor how to undo his idiotic parental controls.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can get rid of the parental control? Maybe by factory restoring the console it'self (people on the internet have no idea what the difference between factory restoring an xbox and formatting it's hard-drive is, so every nasally teenager
 on the internet has now told me how to format my drive)? I don't care for the account, and knowing my brother, he probably used some month-long burner account or something else that I wish I'd never taught him about. I don't want to reset the password, I just
 want to have a fresh-out-the-box experience with the console it'self, add a few battle scars and dust.</p>


<p>TL;DR Brother set parental control and subsequently forgot how to human. How do I reset the entire xbox?</p>

<p>My question, very simplified, asks how you factory restore the 360. I know what will fix it, it's the way I do it that's the problem. Mind giving me more info?</p>

<p>I found this in an older thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[quote user="elquietone"]</p>
<p>I assume your aware restoring to factory default, will delete all the<br />
content from your hard drive that you have including downloads and <br />
saves. It is recommended you make a transfer of them before you do <br />
so(for at least the saves).</p>
<p>To reset to factory default, you first need to go to System <br />
Settings &gt; Console settings &gt; System Info &nbsp; and write down you <br />
serial numbers.</p>
<p>Secondly check in family under the settings tab to make sure content controls are off.</p>
<p>Lastly, you will need to format each drive that is plugged into <br />
the Xbox starting with the HDD. When you highlight HDD(located in <br />
Storage, under System Settings), you will see the option to press Y, <br />
this will present you with 4 other options one of which is format. &nbsp;Upon<br />
selecting format you will be prompted to enter the serial number you <br />
were suppose to write down, and told that doing this will erase <br />
everything. Once you've done that, its a good idea to also go into <br />
network settings and disconnect any wireless connections you have <br />
enabled.</p>
<p>Once this is all done, from the same menu (System Settings) you <br />
will see at the bottom one option called Initial Setup, selecting that <br />
will start the Xbox first load setup all over again.</p>
<p>I apologize if we are not allowed to tell users how to do this, <br />
and as a result I assume this whole post will be deleted, if not, here's<br />
how to do it.</p>
<p>Hope this is allowed and helps. :)</p>

<p>I thank you for the informative answer, Jedi 117, but in your provided fix it tells me to "check in family under the settings tab to make sure content controls are off". The reason I'm formatting the xbox is /because/ I can't get the family controls off.
 Would you happen to have another method you know of, where-by I can do the same factory resetting, but bypassing the family controls?</p>

<p>Bumping to try and get another response, hopefully from a proper support worker.</p>
<p>Here is a check list to consult while considering the answer (wish I didn't need this, because it makes me sound like a nob, but people have proved to need it):</p>
<p>I cannot change parental settings that block me from doing certain things.</p>
<p>I do not want to format my hard-drive (I have a freshly formatted one).</p>
<p>I wish to factory reset my system to get rid of the a fore mentioned parental settings.</p>

<p>Hi. I'm sorry that you haven't gotten a proper answer yet. The only way to do a factory reset on the console is to contact support. Once you've contacted them tell them you need to perform the factory reset procedure due to a parental control lockout. They
 will ask for the serial number on the console, and then they will provide you with directions on how to perform the reset. The reason for this is that different consoles have different reset codes, so they need to look up the one that your console uses via
 that serial number. I just had to do this recently for my console as well, but for an entirely different reason.</p>

<h2>            Fail to factory reset</h2>
                    <p>I have an asus ultra book. Model S500C. Recently, my laptop crashed in the middle of browsing the internet. Gave me the "there was a problem with your PC and needs to reset." It moved too fast before I could read it. Every time I start up, it goes through
 an automatic repair loop, to diagnosing your PC, then back to automatic repair. After a while of this, it goes to a blue screen that says "automatic repair could not repair your PC" I. Have tried refreshing my PC, factory reset (both just keep files and fully
 clean drive resets) and only getting the same error of "your PC failed to reset. No changes were made" I have tried resetting the uefi firmware settings to default and trying to reset again. Still failed. I have no back up drives, since windows 8 came pre
 installed with the laptop, and it does not have a cd drive for DVDs. I've tried a few command prompt but I don't remember which ones I tried. I have no system restore points and can't access system recovery image since I have no backup files for windows 8.
 Someone please help. I have searching for two days how to solve this and nothing is working.</p>

<p>Hi<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
As this OS was preloded and you have not created ant recovery Disc<br />
anyhow we have to repire OS by OD CD,as you dont have and Asus had given this OD.Kindly contact Asus
<br />
to reimage OS,<br />
<br />
Few more information required also<br />
<br />
Are you able to go to safe mode?<br />
what is the process you are following TO Rest window<br />
<br />
<br />
Here some process you can try<br />
<br />
Following these steps should only be used if you are attempting to use the "Refresh your PC" or "Reset your PC" options in Windows RE because your system is in a non-bootable state.<br />
<br />
1.After Automatic Repair fails to repair your PC, select "Advanced options" and then "Troubleshoot".<br />
2.Select "Advanced options" and then select "Command Prompt".<br />
3.If prompted, enter in the password for the user name.<br />
4.At the Command Prompt, go to the \windows\system32\config folder by typing the following command: cd %windir%\system32\config.<br />
5.Rename the System and Software registry hives to System.001 and Software.001 by using the following commands:<br />
ren system system.001<br />
ren software software.001<br />
<br />
NOTE: Renaming the Software hive will not allow you to use the "Refresh your PC" option. If you want to use the "Refresh your PC" option, only rename the System hive. If the Software hive is also corrupt, you may not be able to use the "Refresh your PC" option.<br />
6.Type "exit" without the quotes to exit the Command Prompt and reboot the PC back to the Automatic Repair screen.<br />
7.After selecting "Advanced options" and then "Troubleshoot", select either "Refresh your PC" or "Reset your PC".<br />

            I cannot get into safe mode since every time it resets, it goes through a repair loop and fails. I did try the command prompt, but it said software could not be accessed because it was being used in another process. System rename worked, though and I tried
 a reset and it failed again, so I tried continue to windows, but it went through the auto repair and failed again.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Automatic Repair Loop after System Update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Automatic Repair Loop after System Update.</h2>
                    <p>I recently did the latest system update to my Windows 8.1 PC and now when I turn on my PC I just go into this Automatic Repair, it will fail to repair it then I get Advanced options, I have tried all of them nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update prior to the latest one I had the same problem but managed to get my system back up and running through System Restore, but both of the restore points I have available to me now fail every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the Command Prompts chkdsk\ r as this was recommended but still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way to just get my PC back up and running, I really don't want to fresh install Windows because I have lost the activation key to my Windows 8 Pro upgrade disc, which I payed somewhere around $40 for as an upgrade to Windows 7. This means
 If I absolutely have to to clean install Windows, I'm going to have to purchase Windows 8.1 and pay around $130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was running fine before I did these updates, running perfectly, I could turn my PC on and off with no drama's. But these updates seemed to have ruined it. I have also seen a lot of other cases of exactly the same problem after the recent update
 so I know it is not just my PC playing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be fantastic, even if I could somehow fresh install without having to pay for a new Windows 8.1. I have a back up of everything I need, which is just pictures, I don't bother to back up movies and music as they are all linked with my iTunes
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a heap for any help you can give me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>SamoPepsi.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; wininit lsass.exe windows server restart, Event IDs&#58; 1000, 1001, 1015, 6005, 6006</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I have recently joined in a Bank company as a IT support executive below I have explained about an error which i'm unable to fix it.<br />
<br />
This company is running windows server 2008 r2 standard sp1 64bit OS.<br />
<br />
HP proliant DL380 G7 intel xeon<br />
system processor: intel xeon E5620<br />
<br />
This company is facing this problem from April 2014 to till date but issue not yet fixed because there is no IT administrator in this company to maintain this&nbsp;server.So, in this company I'm the only guy with IT knowledge and my management expecting me to fix
 this error and to run this server without any issues.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From past few months I fixed many server related issues in this company like windows update, windows daily backup, SQL server backup, user permissions, low disk space&nbsp;and network troubleshooting and IT hardware related issues etc..,<br />
<br />
But coming to this lsass.exe I'm unable to fix this issue as I tried many ways by searching in online but not yet fixed. Below you can find details.<br />
<br />
*)hotfix for windows server 2008 R2 Standard sp1&nbsp;<br />
<br />
following installation failed to install<br />
Hotfix for Windows (KB2545850)<br />
<br />
*)Tried using System Update Readiness Tool&nbsp;<br />
But failed to fix issue<br />
<br />
*)I've tried this command in command prompt<br />
sfc /scannow&nbsp;<br />
result<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
</p>
<p>*)I also tried to change registry values from one of the web link from dell but there is no change at all.<br />
http://www.dell.com/support/Article/us/en/19/SLN291309/EN&nbsp;<br />
<br />
*)I thought to install hotfix and few other updates in safe mode just to try my luck but when I tired to boot server in safe mode it is taking very long time to boot into&nbsp;it. But still I'll try again if this issue will fix through safe mode so please advise
 me on this.<br />
<br />
So coming back to this issue, at the time of restart one small window will pop-up as below.&nbsp;<br />
windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart automatically in one minute. Please save your work now.<br />
<br />
*)I have Tried this cmd in command prompt shutdown -a to stop this shutdown but not working at all.<br />
<br />
*)I tried many ways to fix this issue but none of them worked for me even I tried to update from sp1 to sp2 but failed to do it because of the following reason:<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17669<br />
<br />
after downloading software from above link and when I tried to install below error popping up.<br />
This service pack does not apply to the version of windows running on this computer.<br />
<br />
This is the only issue which I'm unable to fix it. So, I need expert help to fix this issue ASAP.<br />
<br />
Note: I can't reinstall this server OS because it is running many applications on SQL database 2008 and also it is already configured with many services and I really&nbsp;don't know how many applications do I need to take a backup and how to configure manually.
 so if I reinstall OS and if I miss any configurations or settings then it&nbsp;will be difficult for employees who are working on those applications.So, I don't want to take a risk of doing that as I said I'm new to this company.<br />
<br />
Additional Information: This sever when ever it will pop-up like server will restart in one minute then it is restarting for 3 times without any gap and then&nbsp;after long interval of 3 to 4 hours then it will follow same as I said above. To understand better
 I'll give this good Example: If server restarting at 9 am then the 2nd&nbsp;restart will be at 9:02 am and the 3rd restart will be at 9:04 am then after 3 to 4 hours of gap like around 1 pm it will restart again for 3 times vice-versa.<br />
<br />
Even I can understand that I have to reinstall this OS to fix this stupid issue which is like a nightmare for me but right now I can't. So, please help me to fix this&nbsp;issue without reinstalling server OS.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting best answer for my question which will fix my problem without any trouble to this server.<br />
<br />
This below five examples are the main reason for my server restart. If you need anything more information please advice me I'll reply as per your instructions.<br />
Event ID 1000<br />
Event ID 1001<br />
Event ID 1015<br />
Event ID 6005<br />
Event ID 6006<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> --&gt; <em>I was not getting an error message.&nbsp; My USB ports merely stopped working, so I went&nbsp; into 'device manager'</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and discovered the usbhub.sys file was&nbsp;corrupted.</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Since when are you facing this issue?.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>--&gt; I struggled with the problem for about a week before I&nbsp;sought assistance via the Community.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the steps outlined&nbsp;in <strong><em>Method 1 </em></strong>below, the issue is now resolved.</p>

                    <p><span>Alright, so I have a home built Desktop, runs fine about... 90% of the time... but when I play a handful of games, or Stream online, I get a BSOD that points to "Ntoskrnl.exe" as the cause after using WhoCrashed. Occasionally
 I'll get "Kernel_Security_Check_Failure" or "KMODE_Exception_Not_Handled" as well.</span></p>
<p>The crashes aren't immediate:&nbsp; when playing Overwatch, I tend to get a good 20-30 minutes of play in before the BSOD occurs.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for providing a detailed and complete description of the issue. The Kmode_exception_not_handled error can sometimes be caused by missing drivers. For us to fix this issue, we recommend to install the missing drivers by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows Key + X then choose Device Manager from the menu.<br />
2. When Device Manager opens, find any unknown devices, right click them and choose Update Driver Software.<br />
3. Choose "Search automatically for updated driver software." If that doesn’t work, you may want to try the "Browse my computer for driver software" option instead.<br />
4. After you’ve installed all the missing drivers, check if the issue is resolved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get back to us if you need further assistance.

    <title>Synaptics SMBus TouchPad frozen after resume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alastair grant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics SMBus TouchPad frozen after resume</h2>
                    <p>I can't find anybody else with this specific issue, but I'll ask away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has installed a driver from Windows Update from Synaptics for my touchpad - v 19.0.13.0.&nbsp; It generally seems to work ok, although a few features are missing from the control panel UI around tapping, but it all falls apart when my laptop resumes
 from sleep/hibernation - the mouse is completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with the default PS/2 driver and this issue doesn't occur so it seems to be a driver specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of any good workarounds - Synaptics only seem to provide technical contacts to OEMs and my laptop is of course, an ancient Ivy Bridge one, so no support for Windows 10 from the OEM.</p>

            <p>I've been trying out PS/2 drivers as a workaround - but these seem to suffer from being un-willing to save your settings after a log-off.&nbsp; There are other posts on this forum about that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be when (if) the settings saving problem is resolved then forcing a PS/2 driver will be a working solution.&nbsp; Until then I think I'll try Fedora on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried v19.0.12.95, 19.0.13.7, 19.0.17.0</p>

<p>
</p><p>Finally a place to find an answer to this annoying problem&nbsp;(hopefully...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, did anyone try the second driver for windows 10 on synaptics.com, which says "Windows 10 12C devices"?</p>
<p>Will it solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a quick note, that when you go to synaptics settings (found in additional mouse settings), look in the bottom right corner. You will see synaptics.com/windows10preview!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this problem because of the driver thinking that this is still TP, or it's not yet fully compatible with all Windows 10 devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :D</p>

            <p>Hi @Germ6n</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I followed your steps, but the only thing it did was install the latest Synaptics driver, ie. version&nbsp;19.0.19.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may help some of us here, but for me, it didn't work, because, again, as I said, whenever I have driver version 19.0.19.1 installed, it stops working after a sleep/hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, I have found a workaround, by installing the previous version,&nbsp;10.0.10240.16384 (which was recommended for my vaio laptop product: SVS13A15GGN), but it does not have those cool two finger swipe gestures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you understood my problem here :)</p>

StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 Repair Disk
<br />
when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows 7<br />
Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner running
<br />
XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A homegroup is a group of PCs on a home network that can share files and printers. Using a homegroup makes sharing easier. Issues with homegroup occur if there are misconfigured settings. To troubleshoot your issue, we recommend running the HomeGroup Reset
 troubleshooter. This troubleshooter can help us find the cause of the issue and fix it at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, connect your Windows 10 PC to a home network, and make sure no other PCs in the homegroup are connected.</li><li>Then, run the <a href="https://aka.ms/diag_homegrouponline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HomeGroup Reset troubleshooter</a>.</li><li>Lastly, select <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>HomeGroup</strong>, select it from the list of results, and then create a new homegroup.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, download and run this <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find and fix problems with viewing computers or shared files in a homegroup</a>, same thing with the HomeGroup Reset troubleshooter, it can automatically identify and fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more troubleshooting steps, refer to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HomeGroup from start to finish</a>.</p>

<h2>            HP Envy TouchSmart SleekBook M6-K025DX unable to upgrade to 8.1 0x1900101-0x40019</h2>
                    <p>Just wanted to add another hardware profile to the long list of PCs that are unable to upgrade to 8.1. I just purchased my laptop&nbsp; yesterday from BestBuy, ran all the updates, and then tried 8.1, but got the blue screens and sketchy behavior that others
 have noted. At least the OS reverted back to 8.0 - I thought I had a brick on my hands. Overall I'm pleased with this laptop, so I feel bad for the vendors who have to put up with a really bad release, and I now understand why so many&nbsp;models are shipping with
 8.0 instead of 8.1. I really like where MS is headed with the OS, but this episode has been&nbsp;a sharp reminder of why I ditched Windows for a year to run&nbsp;Ubuntu 12.04&nbsp;on my previous laptop.&nbsp;Please don't make me go to Apple,&nbsp;let's figure this out Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Updated my daughter's new HP Envy TouchSmart M6_k022dx yesterday without an issue. Followed my normal procedure: 1) updated with all of HP's updates which included a bios update - think there were about 14 updates, 2) fully updated from Windows update&nbsp;between
 60-70 updates, 3) created the 5 system&nbsp;DVDs as provided by the HP utility (yea I spent the $39 or so for an external DVD drive, 4) ran&nbsp;Microsoft's compatibility checker. After all that was accomplished, upgraded to 8.1. Upgrade was flawless and continues to
 work as expected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To date I've upgraded 4 systems ranging from a 7 year old Toshiba laptop to this latest HP laptop and&nbsp; except for having update a driver on the Toshiba and reinstalling one application the process has been one of the easier ones.

            Sam - Thanks for your response. The first time I tried to update to 8.1, I did all the MS updates first, but didn't think to do any HP updates until prompted by the HP Utility Center app. So, I opened the HP app again today, checked for updates, and then
 tried 8.1 again - no luck. Can you tell me what specific website you are referring to? Tks!
<div><br />
<div>Quick update (edit) - I went to the HP website I think you referred to, downloaded a scan utility, and it found no updates were available. I'm at a loss. But, at least 8.0 is decent.</div>

            Sid - Thanks for trying to help. I tried again today, and I think I have all the MS and HP updates, but no luck again. I didn't try the compatibility checker, but will give that a shot. I also picked up an external CD/DVD drive, so I'm curious where you
 found the utility for the system DVDs. I looked in the pre-installed HP Utility Center, but didn't find anything. Tks!
<div><br />
<div>Quick update (edit) - I ran the compatibility checker, and it found no issues. So, I'm stumped. I think the big boys are going to have to figure this one out.</div>

            Sid - 18 yr Scotch - now the discussion is getting good! What's your brand? I've been enjoying some 16 yr Lagavulin. Maybe that's my problem - I need an older bottle.

Jebbediah-  


Did you ever resolve the problem? I have the same issue with a new one I just purchased, and spent over 2 hours with MS support yesterday. I turned off all the power management, and let it sit all night in a hung up condition.  


Note- I also have the Lagavulin 16, but have found lately I prefer Ardbeg, BenRiach, and Laphroaig- especially the Laphroaig Cairdeas finished in Pedro Jiminez Sherry casks.  


They did not help me get through the issue the other night, but I did enjoy doing a taste test.  


Steve 



UPDATE: 


I got it to work- here's how: 


1. Turned off power saving settings and left it on the charger, so it would not shut down, or sleep 


1.a turned off all Norton ****.  


2. Went back to factory setup and started the PC from scratch.  


3. Downloaded all W* updates 


4. Downloaded all HP updates.  


5. Called MS Support and got them to give me a Key for W8.1 


6. Googled Install Windows 8.1 using Software key 


7. Selected save settings and files 


8. I

            I thought I had it licked, but it turned out to be short lived. Here's what happened in a nutshell:<br />
<br />
1) Microsoft tech support was able to get me up and running, but only after doing a fresh install of Windows 8.1. They generated a product key for me and did the install from scratch. Things worked well for a week until...<br />
2) We received an automated update from Microsoft, which required a restart. However, upon restart, the computer was unable to boot into 8.1 (we got black-screened).
<br />
3) I tried recovering the OS as before (unplugging from AC, doing two reboots), but it didn't work.
<br />
4) I called HP support and, after running some hardware (disk, RAM) diagnostics, they were also unable to restore the OS. We started the process of using the on-board recovery, and the tech assured me it would work, but I had to try it on my own b/c I needed
 to go. <br />
5) I talked to a HW manager during that same session, and he said I need to go back to 8.0 and wait for discs from HP to upgrade to 8.1, i.e. that it is still in Beta testing. In the meantime, if I wanted to restore my OS AND keep my partition with my personal
 files I would need to get some recovery discs from HP. He said based on current demand it would be about a week before I get them.
<br />
6) I decided it wasn't worth the wait, so I tried to proceed with the normal recovery, which would get rid of my partition and all my files. But, it appears that because I partitioned my disk even the recovery does not work! 'So, until those discs arrive I
 have a brick on my hands.<br />
<br />
I can understand now why manufacturers are starting to make hybrid laptops with Android and Windows!
<br />
<br />
My fleeting experience with 8.1 is that it is much better, but I'm not going to try updating again until HP has finished all their testing and sends customers their 8.1 updates. One thing that was nice about the fresh install was that it removed all the bloatware
 from the HP load, but I guess I'll have to remove all that extra software down the road. I'll update this thread once I have some new information...<br />

            <p>Hmmm- I had a similar experience. The first time I tried this, I came up with what looked like a clean 8.1 install. I then went to the Microsoft update site, and it said there were updates for 8.1 that needed to be installed. So I did. And As you stated,
 it then went out to no man's land, and I wasn't sure it would even be recoverable. I had to pull the battery and reset it about 5 times before it finally came up and allowed me to restore it to its original state. WHICH WAS W8- not 8.1.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, then I followed the whole path again. Mind you at this point, I had installed nothing else on the machine, so I was just looking to go with a clean setup. That was when I posted the previous comments. Since that time, I dumped the Norton **** that came
 with the machine and installed the MacAfee that I prefer. I also turned off automatic upgrades, and instead set it to "notify me of what you want to install, and I will choose." I also created a restore point that is at the clean 8.1 install. Based on your
 experience, and my previous one, I will not install ANY updates until I know that they have it past the Beta stage. And know that HP has it fixed.

<p>I guess you must have bought an external disc drive? </p>

            I can't pull the battery out of mine, but I think I'd probably just wait for the discs at this point anyways. I'll definitely establish a new restore point when this is all said and done. And I did purchase an external drive - a Samsung off of Amazon.
 But that reminds me - since it's an external drive, they're sending me a bootable USB flash drive, since the PC won't boot off an external drive.
<br />
<br />
What a mess. I'll go out and get myself some Laphroaig!<br />

<h2>            Threshold 2 Is a Disaster</h2>
                    <p>1. Why for god's sake did it take 5+ hours? I&nbsp;almost wanted to cry&nbsp;at the ludicrousness of it... not to mention&nbsp;what this update must&nbsp;have done to my SSD's write cycles. I can't wait to see how long it takes on tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why were my Synaptics&nbsp;touchpad drivers uninstalled leaving me with a hugely inferior touchpad capabilities. How are most (non-techy) users going to handle this? This just makes you want to throw the computer against the wall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. All my custom Intel graphics color settings were also reset. Dear lord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Laughably, the much touted Titlebar color doesn't kick in unless you turn OFF "Show color on Start, etc..." and then turn it back on. Who QA'd this? I mean, WTH?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. All that just for a few minor improvements? Who is in charge over there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, something is very very wrong at Microsoft.</p>

            <p>well since I roll back to windows 7 from windows 10 spyware</p>
<p>I try out 3 different Linux distros</p>
<p>Ubuntu,Linux Mint and Elementary OS</p>
<p>for a windows user like myself who doesn't know anything about Linux</p>
<p>Elementary OS it works just great</p>
<p>easy to install </p>
<p>easy to use</p>
<p>very hard to mess things up;-))</p>
<p>I still dual booting but I'm trying an experiment&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 full week with Linux only</p>
<p>let's see how it goes..!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW</p>
<p>I have to thanks Microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>because if was not for them with that trash windows 10</p>
<p>and the fact they already stated that</p>
<p>they're going to drop the support for win7 in 2020</p>
<p>I probably not looking for an alternative&nbsp;</p>
<p>like I'm doing right now&nbsp;</p>
<p>so thank you Microsoft to make me discovery Elementary OS&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Linux in general..!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>you know Microsoft is brainwashing the public by say that</p>
<p>windows 10 is a big success and you're going to love it</p>
<p>but when you're an investor who try to figure it </p>
<p>if invest to Microsoft still a good investment </p>
<p>and you go look the OS share market percents </p>
<p>then you notice that Windows from Microsoft</p>
<p>went to 75% down to 68% and plus you add </p>
<p>to how unhappy the users are with windows 10</p>
<p>you beginning to worry about your investment </p>
<p>and probably you're going to sell out your Microsoft stocks</p>
<p>since the company already lost 7% in OS share market in the last past 4 months
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>then it doesn't matter if you dislike windows 10</p>
<p>and others in this community they're going to tell you that</p>
<p>you're just paranoid over windows 10 privacy or is your computer fault etc ect</p>
<p>because when is about to protect your investment </p>
<p>one thing you don't want to do is lose money</p>
<p>and Microsoft lost 7% in OS share market since windows 10 was released</p>
<p>NO before but only after windows 10 it was released that Microsoft begin to lose</p>
<p>so conclusions that is a clear indication that microsoft lie about how successful windows 10 it is.!!</p>
<p>and for those who are going to say</p>
<p>oh you say things but you can't prove it buh buh buh buh and buhhhh..!!</p>

            <p>Well, I'm not worried about Microsoft as a company because in terms of Enterprise they're still hard to beat. However, in the Consumer realm? They are seriously flailing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it's their own fault.&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=74" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=74</a></p>
<p>That article written by one of their coders&nbsp;from a few years ago is&nbsp;very telling. They're caught in a very sloooooow downward spiral.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no doubt that if Apple released a performant, but&nbsp;more budget friendly&nbsp;laptop and business desktop ($500-$600) range that they would pretty much obliterate the PC market overnight. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 pushed in 2016.</p>

            <p>Well I seemed to have gotten it. It's nothing great. It's not&nbsp;worth it. Trust me. Definitely not worth the arduous install (it's a Classic&nbsp;service pack for all&nbsp;intents and purposes... meaning it overwrites EVERYTHING and creates Windows.old folder whether
 a file has changed or not). And, for what?&nbsp;Windows 10 continues to boggle my mind.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, what boggles my mind even more is that nobody really seems to care. That, perhaps, is the truly telling thing. OS X gets nuanced and highly detailed reviews (just compare Ars Technica reviews of OS X compared to Windows in terms of information). OS
 X&nbsp;is absolutely loved (or totally hated... though&nbsp;mostly loved).&nbsp;Techcrunch's iPad Pro review just
<em>today</em>&nbsp;was a testament to nuance and truly detailed information. Windows 10 reviews are almost always like the review just glosses over it- barely caring. There is no detailed analysis. I, mean, seriously the OneDrive W10 disaster&nbsp;alone should be filling
 up headlines. But, it's not. Why? Because nobody&nbsp;really uses OneDrive. I see DropBox on every machine. People don't care about OneDrive... and soon they&nbsp;won't care about Windows, they&nbsp;won't care about Visual Studio, etc. I don't think MS's&nbsp;developers really
 care either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could be completely wrong, but I think this holiday season is going to be a shocker. The PC business is going to crater. And,&nbsp;it will be because of Windows 10.... which, in my opinion, is almost as disastrous as Vista. It even
<em>feels</em> like Vista.&nbsp;Yeah, the return of Start Menu is welcomed, but almost everything else about this god-forsaken hodge-podge of a headache-inducing&nbsp;UI is a disaster.</p>

    <title>how do I uninstall the microsoft mouse and keyboard center when I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how do I uninstall the microsoft mouse and keyboard center when I can&#39;t find the entry for it anywhere</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; I was trying to install either the Microsoft mouse and keyboard center or intellipoint so I could use one of my Microsoft Mice. They are both wireless and when I tried to install the mouse and keyboard center I got a prompt that it neede to be uninstalled
 before it could be reinstalled. That is fine but the entry is nowhere to be found either in the directory or the start menu. Same with the Intellipoint. That one states there is already an updated version installed or an earlier version installed and has to
 be uninstalled before you can reinstall. That is also nowhere to be found in Programs and Features or the directory or the start menu or the Program Files........ Are you feeling me yet???? How can I uninstall if I can't find it??? I used the Microsoft fix-it
 for install and uninstall but it asks for a 38 number product code of the mouse and keyboard center in order to uninstall. I am at a loss as how to uninstall these unless I get directions for the registry uninstall

<p>The billing department can tell you why. Usually it's because auto-renewal was left on, but you didn't have the money to pay when renewal came up. So you're left with a balance that has to be paid off.</p>

    <title>Sound and microphone no longer work after upgrading to Skype version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound and microphone no longer work after upgrading to Skype version 7.36.0.150</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1720 running Windows Vista Service Pack 2. When I updated Skype to version 7.36.0.150 my microphone and speakers no longer work, although they still work fine with other programs. I have checked my sound card driver and Windows says
 it is up to date. When I make a Skype test call I hear nothing. But in Audio Options in Skype when I talk I can see the audio level indicator move and when I test the speakers with the 'check speakers' button I hear sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>

            the best way to use Skype again for you is to buy a modern laptop with an Operating System that the new Skype supports.

            <p>Hey there, saxman!</p><p><br /></p><p>We are indeed aware of a situation with the iOS&nbsp;version of the Xbox App crashing upon opening it. We’ve fixed a number of startup crashes based on data that has come back from the community, but we’re having trouble nailing down the specific conditions that are causing the issues that you’re seeing.&nbsp;We’re hoping you can provide a bit more data and try a few experiments for us in order to help us narrow down and fix the issue that is affecting you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
  </p>
<ol><li>When you say crashing on startup, are you seeing any user interface&nbsp;before the app crashes? If so, what screen are you seeing right before it crashes?</li><li>Upon uninstalling and reinstalling the Xbox App, which of the following is happening:<br /><ol><li>Does it give you an option to sign in, and you can type in your account information before it crashes?</li><li>Does it go straight to the signing-in screen (a green screen with a spinner on the bottom) as if it knows your account information, and then crashes?</li></ol></li><li>Are you not getting any user experiences&nbsp;before it crashes?</li><li>If you are able to sign in before crashing (option (a) in the list above), can you please try creating a new dummy account and sign in using that account to see if it still crashes? We need to determine whether this is a condition specific to your device or whether it is specific to your account before we can proceed further.</li><li>Are you willing to let us pass your account information along to 
<p>&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>Thanks for helping us&nbsp;continue to investigate the startup issues you’re seeing – we recognize it’s frustrating and we’d like to get this figured out as quickly as we can.</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Nice to hear i am not alone!&nbsp;I have the same&nbsp;issue as you have!&nbsp;My App is not working for&nbsp;a month or longer.&nbsp;Since the first time the App crashed after starting we had 2 or 3 updates for the App and an IOS update but still it is not working. I am using IPhone 6S and do always all the updates. I thought maybe it is a Problem about the IPhone 6s but a friend has the same and his xbox App works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English ;)</p><p><br /></p><p>May I can help you to to get more data. First yes please take all informations you can get from my account if it helps! To answer your questions:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>1. After I clicked on the Icon I see the normal green screen as usual and then it changes a bit as you see at&nbsp;the attached pictures. But this takes les then 1 or 2 seconds. After that the App is closes.</p><p><br /></p><p>2. I also uninstalled the app and deleted it manually from the cloud and reinstalled ist several times. Unfortunately nothing changed. It looks always like the pictures below. No options to sign in or anything. The only thing is on the first start my phone asks me if the app is allowed to send me messages.</p><p><br /></p><p>3. And 4. See above&nbsp;</p><p>5. Yes please!

<h3> rosstucks  say:</h3>
<h2>            File copying speed fluctuates and hangs on 0&#37;. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;HP xw8600 workstation with&nbsp; 2xE5440 processors, 32gb ram and 480GB SSD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been working fine up until the last week or so where it has started to run slow and do some weird things. It is used to edit and render graphics working off shared storage in an office. All other PCs are working fine so its not a network problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When copying anything to the PC (either from the shared storage or even just from the desktop to my documents on the same hard drive in the PC) the speed fluctuates massively between 150mb/s-30mb/s and then up and down until it finally settles around 10mb/s
 before dropping to 0mb/s and hanging for a while. This then repeats until the file is transferred.&nbsp; When copying from the PC to the shared storage it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have tried these steps to try and get to the bottom of it</p>
<p>-Wiped PC with fresh install of windows 10</p>
<p>-Changed SSD out for hard drive with windows 10 on&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Removed all ram and other PCI-e cards and just run with one 1 stick of ram (tried a couple of different sticks)</p>
<p>-Different network cards and ports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-resetting BIOS to factory settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this has helped. I have found a few things online that I have tried and none of that has helped either. Is there something simple I am missing here or is something big about to go on the motherboard or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pulling my hair out here trying to sort this out. Any ideas?</p>

 switch or the router to another device.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When the <strong>Large Send Offload</strong> option is enabled, the segmentation takes place in the Ethernet adapter instead of the server. Since the Ethernet adapter is unable to identify the MTU of the switch, sending a wrong
 frame size leads the frame to be dropped. However, if this process happens in the server then the MTU size can easily be identified, hence data equal to the MTU size is dispatched, and consequently, the overall data transfer speed is improved at the expense
 of the CPU’s performance.</span></p>
