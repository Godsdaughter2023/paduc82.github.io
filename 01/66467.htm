    <title>Cortana on Android not syncing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meghansk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana on Android not syncing</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Cortana app installed and a windows 10 PC. I have installed Cortana on my Android phone with all the sync options enabled and have already gone through all of my apps to make sure that they are enabled as well. The sync
 settings are also enabled on my PC. \ However, Cortana is not syncing across my devices. I am not able to access the contacts on my phone from my PC, and any reminders that I place will only show up as notifications on the device that I initially put them
 on, not on both. Also, the voice command "hey cortana" will not activate cortana on my android phone despite enabling it in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what is going on? Is this happening to anyone else? O is there something that I am missing?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cortana functionality is reserved to a particular system. There is no feature to sync Cortana functionality with other devices. Reminders will only be present on the device that it was set to.
<strong>Hey Cortana</strong> feature was also disabled by Microsoft since it conflicts with Android's
<strong>OK Google</strong> feature. To know more about it, go to this <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/08/24/cortana-now-available-on-android-in-public-beta/#13zJ60wvLAP89eZi.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Please turn the console off and unplug it for 30 seconds and that may fix this temporary issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug the controller in and hold the Xbox button and the Menu button (3 lines button) for 10 seconds and see if that helps. This resets controllers sometimes that won't turn on properly - although not your exact issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, you should contact Razer's support for help updating the controller's firmware or to see if this is a problem with the controller:
<a href="https://support.razer.com/contact-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.razer.com/contact-support/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The controller doesn't support wireless so it must be plugged in via USB all the time.</p>

<h2>            my xbox one keeps turning itself on randomly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p><p>My xbox one is a few years old, I haven't used it a ton, but i do play it a few times a month. Over the last few weeks I have noticed that it turns itself on randomly when the TV is off and nothing is around it or touches it. I don't have instant on selected or automatic update either. Last night I had to get up and shut it off 3 times. I've tried unplugging it from the wall and then plugging it back in after a few minutes, but it still does the same thing. This is really starting to get irritating because its in my bedroom and I don't want it running 24/7. I have also notices that when I shut the console down the power brick still stays white, even when its off. It doesn't go to orange like it used it. PLEASE HELP!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks!</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; No it is not connected to a power strip or an extension cord, it is powered through an outlet extender. The kind that you plug in to turn it from 2 outlets to 6 but just a basic one not one with surge protection or anything. Could that be the problem? The strange thing is though is that it has been hooked up that way for almost 3 months now and it just started doing this, and also my xbox 360 is hooked up the same way and it isn't doing this.&nbsp; I'm not sure if there is an update that prompts or not, I will plug it back in today and see what happens, I have had it unplugged for a few days now because i was tired of it turning on in the middle of the night and lighting up the whole room ha. Thanks for the help!<br /></p>

<p>The Network Diagnostics Tool tells me that my Laptop appears to be configured correctly. The message is "Windows can't communicate with the device or resource" followed by the name of the Desktop in parentheses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Norton 360 (fully up-to-date) on each device and I have checked Firewall settings on both. Remote connection is not available, either, even though it is allowed on the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping you can provide a solution. If any further information is needed, please let me know.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Product Key is not in a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yes sir, I'm very well aware of that. I can get my product key from my sources here, but that would take time as i received that product key from my company and my company admin isnt available for a month.<br />
<br />
I'm also an advanced computer user and I was digging around the websetup folder under %localappdata%/microsoft/ and the containing files. I now need to know where my product key is stored among those files and in which file is it in?<br />
<br />
I know the panther folder contains the error logs and one particular folder also contains websetup.exe from where the installation starts. But i need to know in which file my product key is embedded in.<br />

            <p>Hello Vinay Balraj,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you really only want the product key then download Magical Jelly Beans KeyFinder
<a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/</a> That will display your product key at the touch of a button.</p>

            <p>Hello Vinay,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I agree Belarc is the better option but only in the sense that Belarc also provides you with other system information. However, on a 'like for like' basis, i.e., keyfinding, there isn't a lot of difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If Windows 8 is not yet installed the only option is for you to contact your company admin in order to obtain the relevant product key.</p>

<p><br />
Hi Vinay</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows installation files are all the same and generic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you apply the Product Key during installation, this is what determines which version (Core or Pro) gets installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the installation, and the product key has been applied&nbsp;is when you can use a third party app, like Belarc to retrieve the product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            you don't understand, they are trying to tell you that as far as Windows&nbsp;OS is concerned that product key doesn't exist until you type it in period. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

    <title>1013 word Complaint letter about XBOX service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ooo peck ooo  say:</h3>
<h2>            1013 word Complaint letter about XBOX service</h2>
                    
<p>First off, your customer support agent Oshaine did an amazing job on listening to my problem and trying to act on it in a timely manner. In the end it was beyond his control and he said he would email the next level of service my problem and I should hear
 from them in a couple of days. He even emailed me the confirmation email to them. It is a shame, however, that XBOX has dropped the ball on this. I have been a loyal XBOX fan since day one (I still have 2 original systems), been on XBOX Live since day one
 of its launch, and have spent THOUSANDS of hard earned dollars on games and Multiple systems (8 original, 4 360’s and so far 1 ONE). From me owning this vast amount of gaming machines, my good friend has been influenced by me and started into gaming. He started
 with the XBOX 360 and PS3. He quickly sold his PS3 because majority of our friends play on XBOX Live. Where I have spent Thousands he probably has spent even more, from owning almost every limited addition game and system, to his multiple purchases from XBOX
 live Arcade.</p>
<p>But it is sad to see what has happened, and it is even more disheartening to hear my best friend say he is done with XBOX. Here is what has led to his potential decision to leave XBOX behind and what is getting myself, and the rest of our friends/family
 that own an XBOX to second guess our purchase: On Saturday November 23<sup>rd</sup> my friend’s XBOX ONE decided not to turn on. He tried many things to resolve the issue but none had worked. He then called me Sunday morning at 6am (as the day before I was
 working until 11pm) to see if I could help him figure it out. He informed me that he had no internet service at the time and had no way of getting on the forums to see what’s going on. I told him I would help. I jumped online and searched up what the problem
 was. We tried all possible solutions, then we were told it would need to be repaired (a broken machine after less than a days’ worth of use). As he had no internet I set up the repair, unknowingly being signed in to my account. &nbsp;He wanted to use the IW Advance
 Exchange, I put in all the required information, address, name, email, Credit card info etc. hit submit, and we waited patiently for a confirmation email. We didn’t expect one on Sunday, but we were expecting one by at least Tuesday. On Wednesday night my
 friend called in the first time to find out what was going on. He spoke with 3 different people and got 2 different answers. One of which said they couldn’t tell him anything without the verification number that was sent to my email (which I then gave him),
 and the second was “to expect it by Friday due to the holiday”. When Friday came and there still was no email or XBOX, my friend began to worry that something went wrong so I logged in to my XBOX account only to find that the order has been cancelled. Now,
 I never asked for the order to be cancelled, nor did my friend. I received no email informing me that my order would be cancelled or that there was an issue with my order. This is where I am perplexed by XBOX’s way of handling this. Regardless if the information
 that was provided did not match the information on file, XBOX should have sent an email to me informing me of the change and the activity, where I could have approved or denied the transaction. As XBOX did not provide anything to myself or my friend we wasted
 a week waiting around for a delivery that was never going to come in the first place. It is now December 1<sup>st</sup> exactly one week after the initial set up for replacement and no XBOX on its way to my friend’s house. No email from the other support as
 promised. XBOX, your lack of communication is terrible. Your responsiveness to handling the issues with broken XBOX ones is atrocious. With the amount of broken systems that have been reported, one would think to up their game and ensure customer satisfaction.
 Ground shipping and week long waiting is not SATISFYING. What are YOU going to do to fix this? With the millions of people around the world who have purchased an XBOX one and the millions more that intend to purchase an XBOX product, would you not want them
 to know and have peace of mind in the product that they are about to, or did buy, that if there is a problem that it will be taken care of in a timely manner? With this being said, I as a long time XBOX owner and Live member, would expect that my issues get
 resolved IMMEDIATELY. I have worked in customer service for almost 20 years and know that if myself or one of my employees brought forth a complaint such as this I would act, I would go above and beyond to resolve the issue, I would keep my customers happy.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from someone within the next 48 hours (today being Sunday and all), and to hear what suggestions they may have as to resolve this terrible issue and to prevent the loss of a dedicated XBOX live member. For if he goes, it will make me rethink
 the company that I have stood behind for the past 10 years and helped promote against Playstation, and others. If my system should break and I too should have to go through this, I can tell you that I would rather eat a 600 dollar loss then put up with this
 type of customer service, and all of my XBOX branded stuff would disappear from my household. So Please XBOX, do the right thing and fix this.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Turn off Nemesis&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbarley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off Nemesis&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, on paper it sounds like a cool feature, but in practice, it kinda sucks.&nbsp; I've been hit with a nemesis twice now, and both times it toasted me quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to turn the feature off?&nbsp; Or what is the best way to get out of it when those horns
 start to blow?</p>

<p>I've fought 2 so far on hard difficulty. The 1st one wiped me out pretty quick, but I beat the second one. I did alot of rolling around, and since my character is a crusader, i had my phalanx shooting their arrows as often as wrath would allow, as well as
 hitting it with everything else. It'll go down eventually, if you keep moving(NEVER stand still), and use all your powers. Do that, and you'll be fine.</p>
<p>And yes Runex, it is troublesome, at least on a higher difficulty anyway</p>

<p>Quote:</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>The Nemesis feature allows in-game monsters to level up upon killing players, and then infiltrate other players' games, labeled as Nemeses. Gamers can then take them down and avenge their friends, a unique feature that seems loaded with potential.</p>
<p>"This was… I'm not gonna say contentious, but I had this inner turmoil about this myself because, you know, wouldn't it be cool if this monster became unbeatable and just went from game to game; player to player. And then, about a fifth of a second later
 I was, like, that sounds like a horrible experience. So after a monster has killed his sixth player (after five kills he's fully levelled up) that monster retires. We were also flirting with the idea of maybe having him impact you differently in Hardcore [but]
 we decided that there won't be Nemesis monsters in Hardcore," Matthew Berger, senior level designer at Blizzard, reveals."</p>

<p>Thanks for the Bing tetra! I took out another one. This fight was a pain though. The Nemesis showed up when i was already fighting a big group of demons. I got surrounded! Luckily, my phalanx bailed me out!

<p>I'm not sure that would work. I've fought the Nemesis 8 times but it didn't come from another player's game. Below it's name it shows a face of the last player it killed, which was me. I've killed it 6 times but it never drops any loot, or anything good.
 As I understand it if you kill it after it kills someone from your friends list &nbsp;you get some prize. Plus I've looked at most of the people on my friends list and nobody has Diablo on Xbox One, so I'm pretty sure the Nemesis is spawning just in my game. I
 could be completely wrong thou. I don't know how to stop the Nemesis from coming into the game, sorry.</p>

    <title>Current Windows 10 Install completely broken. Windows Boot Manager not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Current Windows 10 Install completely broken. Windows Boot Manager not letting me boot to USB to repair. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had driver problems. Trying to uninstall drivers led me to these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to boot to Installation USB media (purchased key) I get this issue, which I found someone else had in this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/windows-boot-manager-failed-to-start-booting-from-usb.1780363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/windows-boot-manager-failed-to-start-booting-from-usb.1780363/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my version of the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/iuInKjk.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/iuInKjk.png</a></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>
</p><p>This is exactly the same issue I'm having. If I boot to UEFI USB (the <strong>
purchased </strong>windows 10 Pro USB, as well as a USB made with&nbsp;Media Creation Tool,
<strong>neither work</strong>)&nbsp;, it, it gives me the error described in the thread above. It won't let me boot to anything except Windows 10 32 bit installer, which I could use to delete partitions. But I want to install 64 bits!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if I boot to hard drive, I can get a loop of a screen like this asking me to press F8</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PnX2sUi.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/PnX2sUi.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing F8 leads me here, and any choice on this screen leads me back to the screen above.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/okT2Tqf.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/okT2Tqf.png</a></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So <strong>there are no ways</strong> to use the integrated repair options like reset system - because&nbsp;<strong>they cannot be reached.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Secure Boot is disabled, as such:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- enter in bios, select "Advanced Mode", "Settings", "Windows OS Configuration"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- change "Windows 8.1/ 10 WHQL Support" to "Disabled"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What should I do? So far I see two options<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot to Windows 10 32 bits installer, delete all partitions, restart, boot to Windows 10 64 Bit install USB</li><li>Take out the HDD, format it, then try reinstalling Windows 10 64 bits.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Want I want to do:</strong></p>

</p><p>I cannot access automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I want to reinstall Windows 10 64 bits entirely, by booting to the USB install media.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting to the install media opens Boot menu, asking me to choose between 64 and 32 bits install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choosing 64 bits gives me this&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/iuInKjk.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/iuInKjk.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I must not install 32 bits, because it's just not optimal for my use to do its inherent limitations</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Please advise how to boot to the 64 bits installer.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Honestly, I'm quite disappointed. It seems that whenever I boot to the installation media, it checks for installed files - and detects a broken Windows 10 install. Instead, it should just ignore whatever is already there and let me custom install -&gt; repartition.
 Like Windows 7 did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi, SimonM_2019
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>Can you justify how will resetting the UEFI Bios to Factory settings will resolve my Windows Boot Manager issues, which is an element that is on the hard drive? How will clearing the UEFI BIOS allow me to boot to the USB any more than it does now?</p>

<p>If you are installing Windows 10 from bootable installation media (a USB drive or a DVD) it doesn't matter how messed up your computer is. Your hard drive could be completely unbootable - even blank. It doesn't matter, because you're not booting from the
 hard drive - you're booting from the USB flash drive or DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation media will set itself up in your computer's RAM and install Windows to the hard drive, in effect over-writing everything currently on the hard drive. There's nothing difficult about this, and I'm not saying that to be facetious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's not clear from your original question is whether you purchased a bootable Windows 10 installation USB drive or DVD. If you did, then the only 'trick' is to figure out how to make your computer boot from the installation media and not from the hard
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's an easy question for your computer manufacturer's technical support, if it isn't in the computer's owners manual. Or tell us what make and model of computer you have and someone will look it up for you. Typically you need to press a specific F key
 while the computer is booting, but there are other ways to accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't purchase bootable installation media, you'll have to create it on your own. Not to worry, we can help you with that. It just requires a few more technical procedures. Nothing you can't handle.</p>

    <title>Failed Windows 7 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignatiusdragonxd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed Windows 7 Update</h2>
                    A Windows Update for 7 Professional failed three days ago followed by a failed configuration. After repeated reboots Windows attempted to revert but this just hung. Trying today it has hung for 8 hours. I have tried Restore but this failed even on a Restore
 Point of over a week ago. I have also tried Repair from the original disk but this failed. I can get into Windows in Safe Mode but none of the Repair/Restore options work. How do I get past the failing configuration and get Windows back in Normal Mode?

            Start System Restore from a command prompt
<div>
Applies to <span>
Windows&nbsp;7</span>
<div>
<p>System Restore allows you to undo changes to your computer, such as software updates or driver installations, which might cause your computer to run slowly or not work properly. You can start System Restore from a command prompt window if
 you cannot start your computer in any mode other than Safe Mode with Command Prompt.</p>
<p>You need to have an administrator account to perform these steps.</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer in Safe Mode with Command Prompt. To learn how to do this, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start your computer in safe mode</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Log on to the computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>At the command prompt, type <span>rstrui.exe</span>, and then press Enter.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To start the System Restore tool when you cannot start your Windows Me-based computer normally or in Safe mode, you can temporarily change the Windows shell from Explorer.exe to Progman.exe:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Start your computer by using the Windows Me Startup disk.</li><li>At the <b>Startup</b> menu, choose <b>Minimum Boot</b>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <span>edit c:\windows\system.ini</span>, and then press ENTER.</li><li>Edit the shell= line so that it looks like this:
<div>shell=progman.exe </div>
</li><li>Press ALT+F, and then press S to save the changes to the System.ini file.</li><li>Press ALT+F, and then press X.</li><li>Remove your Windows Me Startup disk, and then restart your computer. When your computer restarts, Program Manager should start. If Program Manager does not start, repeat steps 1 through 7, being careful to follow these steps exactly, and then continue to
 the next step.</li><li>On the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Run</b>, type <span>msconfig</span> in the
<b>Command Line</b> box, and then press ENTER.</li><li>Click <b>Launch System Restore</b> to begin restoring your computer to a previous, functional state.</li></ol>
Notes
<ul>
<li>After you configure your computer to start Program Manager (Progman.exe), you can also start the System Restore tool by typing
<span>c:\windows\system\restore\rstrui.exe</span> at a command prompt, and then pressing ENTER.</li><li>If you still cannot use System Restore, repeat steps 1 through 6. In step 4, change the shell= line so that it reads:
<div>shell=explorer.exe</div>
This sets the Windows shell back to Explorer.exe so that you can continue troubleshooting.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>

            I have run System Restore, including using rstrui.exe, without any success. I have tried using several System Restore points from as long ago as two weeks when I know the system was working correctly but all these System restore points failed to configure
 on restarting.<br />
I am not sure of the relevance of a Windows Me Startup Disk, but I have tried using my Windows 7 Startup Disk but this failed. As I assume changing the Windows shell from Explorer.exe to Progman.exe would still access the same System Restore points, I have
 not tried this.<br />

            I have downloaded and installed the System Update Readiness Tool and this reported that I needed to download and install Windows Hotfix KB947821. This took several hours to download and install but, on completing installation and restarting, although I
 got to Desktop, I was unable to get any further as the rotating circle icon is a permanent fixture and the system just locks up.<br />
For some reason, when I reboot, I get a screen which asks me to select the operating system. One choice is Windows 7, the other is Windows 7 Professional (Recovered). Selecting the first takes me to Desktop and the locked rotating circle icon while selecting
 the second takes me to a Desktop with minimal drivers. For example, the display monitor is generic and will not allow me to change the display to fit my monitor.<br />
I would mention that Action Center reports that Windows Security Center Service is turned off and I am unable to turn it on. Also, I am unable to run Diagnostics.<br />
Looking back, I have been having odd problems with Windows Updates for a couple of months but have always, up until now, been able to revert using System Restore.<br />
As a question, if I try to install Windows 8 over Windows 7 without doing a clean install, to avoid having to reinstall all my other software with the attendant problems of validation, might this resolve the problem of my system not working or would I be creating
 further problems?<br />

            Hi<br />
I have set my computer to clean boot state and it has restarted in normal mode but I am still not able to start Windows Security Center service. I get the message "Windows could not start the Security Center service on Local Computer. Error 1079: The account
 specified is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process." WSCS is set for Log On as Local System account.<br />
I had also managed to get my computer to start in normal mode prior to trying the clean boot state, although I do not know how, and it works but responds extremely slowly. I have run the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool but this found nothing.<br />
I do not know if it is WSCS not being turned on that is causing the problems with my computer but how do I turn it on?<br />
Also, why do I get a Boot Manager screen at startup with Windows 7 and Windows 7 Professional (Recovered) as alternative operating systems?
<br />

            This just gets more confusing and frustrating.<br />
Suddenly, yesterday afternoon, without any action from me, the message in Action Center that Windows Security Center service was switched off disappeared.<br />
I have 15 updates waiting to be installed but, as I am still concerned that the root of my trouble is updates, I tried installing a single update, Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2850851).<br />
This installed but failed to configure on restarting and Windows Security Center service had switched off. I tried using System Restore to go back to the position before I tried to install the update but the Restore Point I used failed.<br />
I am still unable to switch Windows Security Center service on but viewing Update History tells me the Security Update status is "successful".<br />
What is happening? Do I carry on trying to install the updates one by one in the hope that one will correct the position?<br />

<h2>            can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t see xbox dashboard because black box screen blocking view</h2>
                    
<p>This morning we turned on our xbox 360 slim and there is a black box that hides our dashboard and makes it so we cant see it.</p>
<p>we tried re-connecting the cables and turning on and off</p>
<p>we tried connecting to different input outlets on the tv and still same black box</p>
<p>other consoles work on the tv but no longer the xbox 360 because of the black screen we keep getting</p>
<p>we finally plugged in our xbox 360 slim to another smaller tv and it works</p>
<p>why doesn't it want to work anymore on our big tv its a 55 inch toshiba theaterview, a big box standing tv????????</p>
<p>the controls seem to work, i can see barely there is all the regular things in background on xbox dashboard but the black box blocking the way prevents us from playing games and seeing what we are clicking.</p>
<p>when we turn it on for about 1 second we can see xbox dashoard clearly then it turns to the black box covering screen and stays that way.</p>
<p>i would like to obviously play on my big screen instead of a small one.</p>
<p>id appreciate help if anyone knows what is wrong or if anyone has had simular problems. thank you</p>

<p>If the console works on a smaller unit but not the larger one then the larger unit is faulty. &nbsp;It could be a port issue on the larger television set... honestly it could be a lot of thing but you clearly showed it's not the Xbox console so it's best that
 you take this up with your television manufacturer.</p>

<p>Hi, check your tv remote, does it have a closed captions button, usually labelled as Captions or CC, also check that you don't have picture in picture enabled on the tv. You may need to enter the tv settings pages to find these options if they are not available
 directly on the remote.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Look for a menu button on the remote and check for tools or some other options that would hold the closed captioning or picture in picture options.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you have difficulty finding the option then post the make and model number of the tv and ill try to find the manual online and take a look for you.</p>

<p>You should try to reset the console display settings. Make sure you remove any discs from the tray, then turn off the console. Turn the console on using the Guide button on the controller and hold down the "Y" button and pull the right trigger as the console
 boots up. Your console will restart with the display settings set back to default. You should also try resetting your TV's settings to default as well. If you are not using the HDMI cable (ie using component, S-video, or VGA), make sure the switch on the video
 cable is set to HDTV and not STD. If these solutions don't help, you should check your TV's settings.

<h2>            Halo 2 Dedicated Server</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently I got Halo 2 and I thought why not do a dedicated server that all my friends can play on. I also have this dedicated server that has Windows Server 2012 R2. Now please remember I have never ever run the Halo 2 server on the Windows dedicated
 server, but for some reason it says that an instance is already running. I am not really sure what to do I scanned through services, and processes and nothing related to the server comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know how to fix this please do leave a reply that would make my day much much easier because I have been researching for about a day or two with no results.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t upgrade Windows 10 1703 VM to 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> downeaster59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t upgrade Windows 10 1703 VM to 1709</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if this is a Windows issue or a VMWare Fusion issue, but I'll begin here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running Windows 10 (1703) as a VM in VMWare Fusion (10) on a MacBook Pro currently running macOS 10.13.1. &nbsp;My Windows 10 VM has had no issues running Windows Update until recently. The most recent Cumulative Update for 1703 and the Feature
 Update to 1709 don't seem to install properly. They download, install, and then I get the notification to restart, which I do. I see the screen that tells me that updates are being installed and not to turn off my computer. All well and good. But when Windows
 restarts, I see a notification that repairs are underway. Then, a window that tells me that the updates could not be installed and the Windows is reverting back to its previous version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the Troubleshooter and followed its recommendations. No change. I upgraded VMWare Fusion to version 10. No change. I have tried redownloading these updates several times. Same result. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't installed anti-virus software in Windows. It uses Windows Defender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues or ideas as to what is going on or what I can do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

Windows is activated on my VM. I was not prompted to activate Windows. I was trying to upgrade to 1709 using an ISO. Windows Setup stopped and said that it was unable to verify my product key. But my version of Windows 10 IS activated and HAS a product key.
 For some reason, Windows Setup can't find that key. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                    Ok,so here is the problem, which honestly I've had for months now...I was trying to cleanup some files on my computer,well i read somewhere that you don't need your Temp folder so i deleted it i also read something about StartMenu folder taking up a lot
 of space......so i deleted it, it ask for Administrator permission so I clicked ok and it deleted the files, not only that but i deleted it from my recycle bin. really important things such as Desktop and Shop were gone! I was able to get Desktop Back from
 another forum post that had a download which currently now is fine, but that not the worst part, my Change PC setting's is gone as well,when i click it nothing happens and i mean nothing if i also try changing my account picture on the metro screen as well

            <p>Some files can be deleted from the Temp folder, but not the folder itself because Windows uses it to hold temporary files in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit like your car and it's gas tank. You can drain it, but you still have a fully functional automobile. But if you remove the gas tank, then you're not going to be going anywhere until you replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You now find yourself in that situation with your computer. Until you replace the Temp folder and its contents, your machine is not going to function properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you're looking at having to Refresh the system in order to get it going again. What you'll have to do first is to create a Recovery disk and copy the manufacturer's partition to that. This means you'll have to go buy an external hard drive with at
 least 60GB free. But bearing in mind that the cost of a 60GB hard disk and one with a 500GB capacity is barely a matter of cents, you'll be better off with the large capacity drive which you can use for other purposes later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create the Recovery drive, hit Windows key to open the Start screen with the tiles and start typing the word "Recovery". You'll see the option called "Create a recovery drive" appear on the right. Click that and then click Next. Here's a screenshot.<br />

    <title>No Sound from Speakers&#58; Acer Aspire Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinks.here  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sound from Speakers&#58; Acer Aspire Windows 7</h2>
                    My computer's speakers abruptly stopped working the other day. I restarted, and they worked again, then stopped. The problem got worse and worse, until finally, I can no longer hear anything most of the time. Sometimes restarting works, but not usually.
 For a while there was a loud static sound coming from the speakers, but eventually that stopped as well. Also, now when I try to watch hulu or listen to podcasts, it usually tells me that the adobe plug-in has crashed. Sometimes the little volume icon at the
 bottom of the screen will have a little red x on it. I've tried re-installing the sound card drivers, and that helped for a while, but now it usually makes no difference. I've also performed a systems restore, to take it back to a date when it was working.
 Nothing seems to help now. This is so frustrating! Please help me. :)
