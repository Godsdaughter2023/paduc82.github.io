<h2>            Windows Installer has stopped working, tried many different solutions, also periodic&#47;random popup of the same error</h2>
                    <div>Platform: Windows Vista</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I can only install certain programs and other programs just flat out refuse to install/work, along with a message "Windows Installer has stopped working", which also pops up at seemingly random times, which I can only attribute to maybe some process in the
 background that's trying to work but can't. It's been happened for at least a few months, the random error message popups (hundreds in the program that shows me error reports and whether to send to microsoft or not), but most of my programs have been working
 and I've been coping by giving up on the ones that don't. However, I actually bought quite an expensive antivirus which didn't work, and also some games fail to install too. The programs that don't work/install and come up with the msi error message so far
 are Trend Micro, and Terraria (the steam install worked, just the first time setup for "xnafx40_redist.msi" resulted in the error message of msi and terraria not working).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<div>I have checked a lot of solutions to this, including all the ones on one of the microsoft help pages.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. I've checked that my account is admin. because the system time didn't ask me for a password</div>
<div>2. i've done the re-reg thing many times</div>
<div>3. i've run the msi exec without any errors, i can see the little manual it gives me</div>
<div>4. I've checked the properties of the installer through services, changing the startup to manual, automatic, stopping and starting, etc (different forums told me different options, automatic and manual)</div>
<div>5. I've run the windows tool that automatically checks for install/uninstall problems (the one that replaced the old discontinued tool)</div>
<div>6. The version of my msi is 4.5.something, which as far as i can tell is the latest version</div>
<div>7. Pretty sure I've experienced this message while running in safe mode as well, which i did when my computer crashed before (the crash iteslf isn't a problem though, it doesn't happen very often)<br />
<br />
If I can update this question, I'll change the details and maybe add a few more if I've tried any more stuff. So far this is all I can remember. Any help would be appreciated, but if it still doesn't work I'll have to look up how to do reinstalls/restores/reformatting.</div>

            <div>Hi Sandeep V, and thanks for your quick response,</div>
<div><br />
I've run the fixit tool many times which&nbsp;showed&nbsp;no problems, followed the instructions in&nbsp;method&nbsp;2 ,scanned my computer with both an antivirus and SFC scan (with reboot). THese steps have not stopped the error, I'm still seeing it come out of nowherere once
 in a while. However, I'm rather hesitant to follow the steps in method 3 because of the registry editing, I don't want to mess anything up. Also, if there is a problem with windows installer, would upgrading to a newer version of windows, reformatting or restoring
 my computer definitely fix the problem?<br />

<h2>            An Open Letter to Mr. Satya Nadella and Microsoft</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div><br />

<div>

<div>I did not get hit by a car, sit/step on, bang, drop, or throw my surfacebook in any way that would have caused a slight crack to develop. However now I feel like doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent a great deal of time dealing with system crashes, failed updates,
 re-installs of the os, over heating, maxed out cpu 3.17 ghz, followed by a small yellow glow/burn marks that&nbsp;are now around my entire screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have a small crack that developed on top of&nbsp;one of the burn marks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft, your apology letter is an insult to those who really believed fixes were on the way.&nbsp; Now i'm being punished at the cost of $600.00 because you insist my tiny hairline crack was due to physical damage.</div>
<div><br />
I'm disappointed that I waited to contact service becuase I truly believed you would come through with fixes.
<br />
I'm disappointed&nbsp;that you would'nt even look at my surfacebook to determine how the crack occured or if it was a manufacturing issue.&nbsp; Only requesting a photo.<br />
I'm disappointed that the glowing issues on my screen occured a month before the crack (see posts on this site) and you still will not cover my surface book under warranty.
<br />
I'm also disappointed in the lies your technical support rep told me in our chat. (See Below)<br />
I'm also disappointed in the broken language of your support person that made me assume&nbsp;she was going to take care of my issue under warranty.<br />
I'm also disappointed&nbsp;with the inaccurate names&nbsp;given during the chat. </div>
<div>
<p>I'm also disappointed that I received a phone call&nbsp;only to be told I had to hold 3 minutes for a manager.&nbsp; I was then told I needed to go back to the chat to speak with the manager.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Finally, I'm disappointed someone has yet to contact me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Sincerely,</div>

<div>
<p>Irate Customer.</p>
<p>
</p><div>B***e:&nbsp; I was advised by the leads that it is a cracked screen.<br />
B***e:&nbsp; Please know that a cracked screen damage is not covered under warranty. Great news is we can still replace it by submitting an out-of-warranty claim at a cost of $599. Microsoft won't repair your Surface, it will be replaced with the same model and
 storage capacity. We will also cover the shipping and handling fees so you need not to worry about additional costs.<br />
B***e:&nbsp; Upon receipt of the faulty device, we’ll send out the replacement as quickly as possible and it should be delivered to you in 5-8 business days.
</div>

<div><br />
ME: I would like to talk to a manager then.</div>

<div><br />
B***e:&nbsp; I totally understand that we ca replace the device actually, but since it has a crack on the screen it is not covered by the warranty.</div>

<div><br />
ME: If you wont fix the crack then I would like the yellow screen glow taken care of. This started a month ago and I posted pictures on your surface forum.</div>

<div><br />
B***e:&nbsp; And I know the frustration that you are feeling right now<br />
B***e:&nbsp; Since I'am also a customer like you.&nbsp; (Scripted)<br />
B***e:&nbsp; Thanks for your honest feedback,&nbsp; I can honestly tell you that this is not the experience we wanted you to have. What I can assure you is your feedback will be placed with high attention as I myself will personally forward this to our development team.</div>

<div><br />
B***e: Your feedback is very important to us, Me:. We definitely want that cascaded to the correct channel to further improve our products.</div>

<div><br />
PHONE RINGS.&nbsp; <br />
It's B***e from MSft.<br />
Told me to hold for 3 minutes while she gets her manager.<br />
B***e:&nbsp;&nbsp; My manager is now here but would like you to go back to the chat.&nbsp; (did'nt want to talk)</div>

<div><br />
B***e: Me: here is the manager and here name is C***n.</div>

<div><br />
C***n: Hi there, this is Cath, one of the supervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp; (now the manager has changed to supervisor with the name Cath)</div>

<div><br />
C***n: Cracked screen device is considered as a physical damaged.<br />
C***n: And I understand that you did not drop it. <br />
C***n: Hope you understand that these devices are being inspected by our service center.
<br />
C***n: I see. Thanks for the details. They were really of great help to have a better picture of where we are now.
</div>

<div><br />
ME: So basically what your saying is nothing can be fixed due to a crack unless I pay for a new screen?</div>

<div><br />
C***n: To be honest, that's the normal process. </div>

<div><br />
ME: That's horrible considering I have documentation showing issues going back from the day I bought this thing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
C***n: I understand,.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Me:: Who else can I speak with?</div>

<div><br />
C***n: Hmm, Im currently working with our Team&nbsp; to check this case. <br />
C***n: Because if we will follow the process. <br />
C***n: This will&nbsp; still be tag as physical damage. <br />
ME: Physical damage is caused by abuse of the product. This product has not been abused. I feel like I have been beta testing it.<br />
C***n: Please stay on the line </div>

<div><br />
Me:: OK<br />
C***n: Hi there,. <br />
C***n: We're sorry&nbsp; for the inconvenience. <br />
C***n: We've already reviwed the case and sorry to inform you that we need to process this replacement order as an out of warranty replacement.
</div>

<div><br />
ME: Who else can I speak with? </div>

<div><br />
<strong>C***n: Right now, Me:, you're already speaking with the highest point of escalation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (LIE)</strong><br />
C***n: I know that you're currently frustrated right now. <br />
C***n: Hope you undersrtand that we have some process that we need to follow. </div>

<div><br />
ME: I can't believe the surfacebook can't even be looked at to determine if it was assembled wrong or has bad components that caused it to crack. I'm also shocked that none of the other issues will be addressed when its clearly a faulty product.<br />
ME: I understand processes. And know exemptions can be made for items that are clearly faulty from day one.,</div>

<div><br />
C***n: I we could only do an exemption on this, I already did it.&nbsp;&nbsp; (gives Impression will take care of it)</div>

<div><br />
ME: I can't say enough how disappointed I am with Msft. I would have never bought the surfacebook knowing it was plagued with ongoing issues.</div>

<div><br />
C***n: , we definitely don't want this to happen. I know that you had an issue since day 1. However, device has a crack on its screen which will&nbsp; be inspected by our service center.
<br />
C***n: If&nbsp; I could only do this for free, I already did it, just to get this done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( again gives Impression will take care of it)</div>

<div><br />
ME So are you saying you will help me with this issue?</div>

<div><br />
C***n: I wanted to, however we really dont have an option to process it for free.&nbsp;
<br />
C***n:, I maybe a representative from Microsoft, but at the end of the day Im still a customer like you/
<br />
C***n: I definitely understand your situation. <br />
C***n: If I could only do something about it, I already did it. We dont wanna make this hard for you.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
ME: What about the glowing screen </div>

<div><br />
C***n: It just so happen that the're also a crack on the device's screen. </div>

<div><br />
ME: I have pictures showing it was glowing way before the crack developed<br />
ME: That isn't a firmware fix.<br />
ME: Or Driver fix. The screen would have to be replaced.<br />
ME: I guess at this point I would like my issue to be escalated to someone at the top. If you can't do that I will pursue other alternatives.
</div>

<div><br />
C***n: I would to do that, to be honest with you, Me:. <br />
C***n: Me:, it will be easier for me if I will esclate this, however, escalation team will surely send this back to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<strong>Already told me she was the highest point of escalation.</strong>
<div>
<p>C***n: I dont wanted to promise anything which will not gonna happen in the future.
<br />
C***n: If I promise something right now and it will not happen , that will be another disappointment,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
C***n: since you requested to have this escalated, I will do it for you.&nbsp; <br />
C***n: But again, this case might just be sent back to us. <br />
C***n: Hoep this won't affect your confidence in Microsoft,<br />
C***n: At the end of the day my priority is to provide you the best service possible,<br />
C***n: I feel you, Me:. <br />
C***n: Will make sure that everything is noted. <br />
C***n: Anything else that I may help you, Me:?e</p>

            <p>Apparently a Microsoft tech acknowledged a light bleeding problem in Surface 4's .&nbsp; The surfacebook screen is assembled in a similar fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is light bleeding?&nbsp; When&nbsp;a screen isn't completely blocking the backlight, some light leaks through, causing
 the screen bleeding. This can happen if&nbsp;the screen isn't perfectly adhered to its frame.&nbsp; Faulty Glue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what happens if it's not perfectly adhered?&nbsp; The screen can easily crack.&nbsp; Especially if you use the touch screen or stylus. My screen developed a crack right in the spot a brown/yellow glow appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU&nbsp;Microsoft for selling me a defective product and not honoring your warranty&nbsp;for this

            <p>I have had issues with this device since Day 1 (2 replacements) and now, they have embarrassed themselves even further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I handed my device to my co-worker, you uses a MacAir and left it in the hotel but needed to send email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problem.&nbsp; He logs into Gmail and about 30 seconds later says "Your keyboard won't respond and the cursor is gone".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take the SB knowing this has happened to me, hit the detach button, detach, re-attach, and all is good again.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Me - "Yup"</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox One Avatar Editor won&#39;t show original avatar, says &#34;we couldn&#39;t load your original xbox avatar&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The Original Avatar Editor loads instantly and works fine, showing my xbox360 avatar, however, opening the new avatar editor it takes a minute or 3 just to open then once opened if i select Xbox original Avatar the new default avatar i had to select points
 and reacts as if my old avatar loaded up but it infact just says couldn't load your xbox original avatar</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ive cleared the console with a hard reset and ive gone as far as to try to do it on the pc but the new avatar app requires windows 10 and i dont have windows 10 so thats not even an option</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>am i missing something or is the loading of original avatars kinda broken currently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only thing i can think of so far that i haven't and refuse to try is to erase my entire console and reinstall my profile as there should actually be zero reason to have to do that under any circumstance</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool runs into a problem when Creating Media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waddelllee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Media Creation Tool runs into a problem when Creating Media</h2>
                    <p>I ran into a problem when using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool that I just recently downloaded. I attempted to create media for future use. Just in case I needed it to repair or reinstall Windows. The Desktop PC I am trying to create it on is fairly
 new. Built in August of 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs of Desktop PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make: iBuypower</p>
<p>Model: BB901 I Series 506</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i5-6400 @2.7Ghz Genuine Intel 6th Gen Processor</p>
<p>Memory: Apex Data 8Gb DDR4 2133Mhz Dimm</p>
<p>Graphics: Gigabyte Windforce M#: GVN 75TOC2 - 2GI Rev 1.0 Nvidia Geforce 750Ti GTX GPU 2Gb onboard RAM</p>
<p>HDD: Primary Western Digital Caviar Blue 3Tb 7200 RPM, Secondary Western Digital Caviar Blue 1Tb 7200 RPM</p>
<p>Primary 3Tb drive is system drive, Secondary slave non system drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Optical drive: LG 24x DVD RW</p>
<p>WiFi: Edimax AC600 USB Adapter 802.11ac</p>
<p>Mainboard is Microstar MS 7996 B150 M PRO D</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Pro x64 version 1703 build 15063.674</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is when I run the Media Creation Tool either as run as administrator or not I get to the point where it will create media it fails with an error dialog box. Doesn't matter if it is USB or ISO selected as the target media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From dialog box</p>
<p>There was a problem running this tool. Reference error code 0x80070005 - 0x90017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Kaspersky Total Security version 18 installed as Antivirus. It is snoozed when I run the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier I had to use my retail copy of Windows 10 build 10240 to reinstall Windows from a clean install. Updated it to version 1703 build&nbsp;15063.674. Updated all the drivers, KTS and my software. Checked the BIOS for updates. BIOS is current. USB is 32Gb
 in size. BIOS is set for UEFI boot. As I post I am getting Windows Performance issues of freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already ran chkdsk with /f&nbsp; switch. Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, and sfc /scannow with no errors found. Defragged the drive. Cleaned out the temp folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I create Windows 10 media with this problem? I need to do an in place upgrade or reinstall of another Desktop PC with Windows 10 Home x64 on it. That machine is the same as&nbsp; this one. No OS media for that one. I only have the Windows product key.
 And I cannot run the media creation tool on that one either. That one is really messed up to the point I think a clean install is needed.</p>

            1. Right-click on the&nbsp;Media Creation Tool.exe.
<br />2. Press&nbsp;Properties.
<br />3. Click on&nbsp;General.

    <title>Error when creating a zipped folder - &#34;missing or empty zip - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian p mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error when creating a zipped folder - &#34;missing or empty zip file&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 64 bit and want to Zip a large number of items in a foder, about 1200 items amounting to 800MB. I select the items, right click, "Send To" and select "Compressed (zipped) folder". The process starts and after an indeterminate amount
 of&nbsp;time comes up with an error "Compressed (Zipped) Folder Error - Missing or Empty Zip File".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very strange because the process is actually creating the zip folder, sometimes it gets a little way through the process before the error&nbsp;and creates a small zip folder (8MB), other times it get much further and creats a big folder (250MB) but it
 never completes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>

            You might want to use a 3rd party zip software. <br />
I don't know if you are running into a limitation of the program or not. <br />
<br />
Some have trial version you can download to see if it will work for you. <br />
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of late i've seen the&nbsp;80072EFD error code on a few of our machines, its usually possible to run it a few more times and eventually it will get through - however of late its harder to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems not to be related to the PC firewall or the Sophos AV as turnign both off seem not to affect the behaviour.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and AOL 9.8.2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joyce galloway parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and AOL 9.8.2</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Windows 10 when it first became available several months ago, only to discover (after a lot of time and frustration and a call to AOL tech support) that Windows 10 wasn't compatible with AOL. &nbsp;I've seen in the comments where others have had
 the same problem, with the most recent one that I saw being December, 2015. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have AOL 9.8.2 and would like to know if Microsoft has fixed it so that Windows 10 is compatible with my version of AOL before I go through that headache again. &nbsp;If it's not been fixed, I won't be using this version, because I refuse to give up AOL. &nbsp;And
 I know I'm certainly not the only person using AOL, so this really needs to be fixed if it's not already been done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also feel Microsoft should have let customers know about the AOL issue BEFORE we went through the whole process of installing, then spending so much time, energy and frustration trying to find out what the problem was. &nbsp;I absolutely do NOT want to go through
 that again. &nbsp;I would rather pay for a workable version of Windows 10 than go through what I did with the free version that didn't work with AOL, and which caused me a lot of time and frustration.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Jeff, While I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question, I have to point out a couple of things with which I don't agree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first one is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>it's AOL's job to test their program and ensure it works with Windows 10, and they certainly had long enough to do so (and apparently failed miserably)."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Did you notice the date on my question? &nbsp;It was posted almost a year ago, shortly after Microsoft came out with the updated program. &nbsp;So, no, AOL certainly had not had long enough to test it at that time.
 &nbsp;But also, if Microsoft can make sure their program works with other internet providers, then why not AOL, too? &nbsp;It's not like AOL is new to the industry; there are millions of other people who use AOL, too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, where you wrote:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"<em>Why not just get rid of AOL? It does absolutely nothing for you except hog resources and screw up computers. You can keep your AOL email and use a real email program to access it, and there are many
 better browsers out there than AOL's.</em>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While I do have email accounts with three other email service providers, I have been a paid subscriber to AOL for over 21 years, and find them to be far superior to the others.

<h2>            PCI-styrenhet, utan drivrutiner&#47;inga drivrutiner kan hittas.</h2>
                    När jag går in och kollar på "Maskin vara och enheter" så står det att min dator måste genomgå en felsökning, och när den gjort det står det att PCI-styrenheten för enklare kommunikation inte har några drivrutiner installerade, så jag trycker "använd denna
 lösning" och den söker efter drivrutiner men hittar inga alls, och då tryckerjag på "fler alternativ" och då söker den efter online hjälp, men där hittar den inget heller. Snälla hjälp mig. Jag har även försökt använt Live update 5, men det vägrar till och
 med att starta eftersom det är 32 bit och jag har 64 bit men jag hittar ingen live update 5 64 bit.

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 7559 Windows 10 TPM not active</h2>
                    Hello Community :)<br />
<br />
I have Win10 Pro 1511 with a new Dell Inspiron 7559.<br />
<br />
The "Trusted Platform Module"&nbsp; driver fails to start (code 10). I tried updating BIOS, drivers etc. - no use.<br />
<br />
I talked with Dell - they couldn't assist me (I will check with them later).<br />
<br />
So, if it is possible to fix it by downloading a fix(or some other method) - it will be great<br />
<br />
Thank you
                </div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Management</span></strong><span> is a new feature set in Windows to administer the TPM security hardware in your computer. A TPM is a microchip designed to provide basic security-related functions, primarily involving
 encryption keys. The TPM is usually installed on the motherboard of a computer or laptop, and communicates with the rest of the system using a hardware bus.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A <strong>Code 10</strong> error is generated in Device Manager in one of the following situations:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Device Manager cannot start the device.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>One of the drivers that the device needs does not start.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Device Manager has insufficient information to recognize the error that is bubbled up by the device driver.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> In this situation, the <strong>Code 10</strong> error can be a very generic message that indicated some kind of unspecified driver or device problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below on <strong>“This device cannot start” Code 10 error in Device Manager in Windows</strong> and check if the article helps in resolving the issue:</span></p>

            You can also use Powershell for many command prompts.

</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you see the same problem anywhere else besides the upper edge area? When you tilt the pen, does the Pen write without touching even in other parts of the screen?</li><li>If the problem occurs in other areas, and considering the fact that you already have all updates installed, you might want to consider trying a
<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-refresh-or-reset-surface-pro#refresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">refresh</a>&nbsp;</strong>to see if it helps resolve the issue:</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Refreshing Surface reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files, settings, apps that came installed on your Surface and those that you’ve installed from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>You’ll need to reinstall desktop apps from the websites or from the discs that you used to install those apps. Before you refresh Surface, make sure you have access to product keys and installation files for desktop apps that you want to reinstall (for example,
 Microsoft Office).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Refresh from within Windows</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <strong>
Settings</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click Settings.)<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Change PC settings</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Update and recovery</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />

<strong>Get started</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Next</strong>, ensure that your Surface is plugged in, and tap or click
<strong>Refresh</strong>.<br />
Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the refresh process completes (this can take several minutes).</p>

<p>I understand that you don't feel it necessary to refresh the device, as everything else works normally. After reviewing the information that you have provided, I would also agree that the Pen might be causing the issue. In that case, your best bet would

            <p>1.&nbsp; I haven't tried to use it (Network Sharing) until now, so I don't know if it was functional earlier or not.&nbsp; Since buying this laptop, I've installed a great many things, so pinpointing the responsible event is not likely.&nbsp; I had used this personal laptop
 at one point in time on an employer's network, where, as a professor, they (the college I worked for) required me to run a small executable, which I imagine made a few registry changes to permit use of thier network resources, vpns etc.&nbsp; Rollback is not an
 option, although I wish it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I can connect to the internet, and can use browsers, email clients, and instant messaging without difficulty.&nbsp; No error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The location types available to me are public / private.&nbsp; There is no home / work choice.&nbsp; However, practically, this will be a home network (peer to peer) setting, without a domain controller or server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; SSDP is set to automatic, and was already started.</p>

<p>I see 3 panes. Left pane has a tree. Inbound rules chosen.</p>
<p>Middle pane lists inbound rules for a few applications (skype, for example), in columns labelled Name, Group, Profile, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each application&nbsp;name is preceeded by a check mark in a green circle.</p>
<p>However, <strong>I do not see SSDP-in or UPnP-in </strong>in the list, so I cannot enable them.</p>
<p>The rightmost pane contains "actions".&nbsp; SSDP-in and UPnP-in aren't there either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outbound rules (middle pane) is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2.</p>
<p>Computer Browser service is set to automatic. I found it stopped. I tried to start it. It beeped, flashed a dialog box about "may stop if not needed", and then it stopped by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCP Net Bios helper service is set to automatic, and is started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method2:</p>
<p>sfc scan (attempted two or three times before posting my initial query) completed successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise if / what 'default' rules should exist on a vista home premium machine, 'fresh out of the box'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>David</p>

            <p>Having the same issue in my pc (Windows 7 x64).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I found so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- Open "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" window.</p>
<p>1.1- Select "Inbound Rules" on the left.</p>
<p>1.2- Select "New Rule..." action on the right.</p>
<p>1.3- In the "New Inbound Rule Wizard", the Predefined option is grey out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- Select "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer".</p>
<p>2.1- Select "Restore Default Policy" on the right.</p>
<p>2,2- "Could not restore the default policy. Error : 3".</p>
<p>2.3- Found nothing in the events logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- Select "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer".</p>
<p>3.1- Select "Import Policy" on the right.</p>
<p>3.2- Opening a .wfw file from a working windows 7 pc.</p>
<p>3.3- "Policy import failed. Error : Access is denied. Code : 5".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- Cleaned pc with different tools:</p>
<p>4.1- Cleaned pc with "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware".</p>
<p>4.2- Cleaned pc with "Combofix".</p>
<p>4.3- Cleaned pc with "Eset Online Scanner".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5- When restarting the pc, the icon for "Microsoft Security Essential" in not showed in the icon tray.</p>
<p>5.1- "Startup" tab of "Msconfig" is showing the following command "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client\msseces.exe" -hide -runkey". Need to start it in startup menu to make it appeared in process list and icon tray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6- Looked permissions in regedit but found nothing unsual for keys containing "Firewall".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7- Compared all the "Services" with another Windows 7 pc. No difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8- Also look the local group policy (gpedit.msc) for this policy: "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\<br />
System Cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" = Disabled. Found this in another thread. But not working for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9- Also tried this command (running as administrator) without success: "C:\Windows\system32&gt;netsh advfirewall reset".</p>
<p>9.1- Returned error: "An unrecoverable Windows Firewall error (0x3) occurred."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10-&nbsp;Created a new admin user and tried to turn on network discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;No luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11-&nbsp;The only way I'm able to turn on network discovery is to turn off Windows Firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once done, Network discovery is turned on&nbsp;automatically.&nbsp; Also just one&nbsp;inbound rule is automatically added: "Core&nbsp;Networking - Teredo (ICMPv6-In).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12- Also used the "System File Checker" command "sfc /scannow"&nbsp;to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reported that some system files were corrupted.&nbsp; It said that it was unable to repair some of those files and to check c:\windows\logs\CBS\CBS.log
 for details.&nbsp; When I look into that file, there is a bunch of very long technical-looking messages, and no clear indication of just which files were repaired successfully and which files were not repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13- All "Windows Updates" are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14- Also done a "System Restore" but the older "Restore Point" was after I encountered this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15-&nbsp;Done a clean boot.&nbsp; Did nothing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>16- Exported the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\SharedAccess" registries from a working Windows 7 then imported on the failing Windows 7 =&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;PARTLY SUCCESSFUL!</b>&nbsp;Now able to communicate with other computers on the local network.
 &nbsp;The "Homegroup" is working normally. &nbsp;Network discovery is activated. &nbsp;Firewall is ON. &nbsp;But... there's still issues not fixed. &nbsp;Points 2 and 3 above are still there. &nbsp;Sounds like some permissions not set as it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two laptops, W7 and vista, on a wireless netwok. they are connected to a broadband router. Also connected by cable to the router are 3 perpherals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both laptops can see the internet and all the peripherals but they can't see each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the W7 laptop shows the peripherals in explorer under 'network' but they don't show in vista and i get message to turn on network and sharing centre. i've turned off windows firewall and set listed services to enable/automatic but it won't turn on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it used to be fine but i think it's happened since my broadband service provider talked me through resetting my netgear router ans setting up a new network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any thoughts would be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Recent updates for Windows 8.1 Fail to complete&#63; Error code &#58; 0x80240004</h2>
                    <p>For over 3 months now, my computer has failed to update. Before it was working just fine and downloading regularly. Now all of the sudden it will shut down and try to download and install updates, but it will fail and say, "Couldn't complete updates, restarting
 now". I am at a loss on what to do. I did run a troubleshooter which gave me this (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/unable-to-update-to-windows-81-since-the-required/f9437ec2-b521-48d4-a2a2-81e31ab40c62">0x80240004</a>)
 as an error code. I looked it up on other questions on the forum and they said it could either be virus scans, items on start up, or the whole computer needed to be refreshed and re-booted. &nbsp;I tried closing my virus scan and it didn't help. I did not close
 things on start up but I don't really have much on start up. Also I am an honors student who has multiple files on my computer. I do not know how to do the backup files thing. I read an article how to do it but I decided that I should probably wait to do it,
 mainly because I don't know if I am doing it right. I would like to resolve this issue sometime soon. Please respond as soon as possible. Thanks. My computer is Windows 8.1 and it is a 64 bit.</p>

 as i said before. When i run the windows diagnostics, the only areas that come up with problems is troubles with recent updates and some files were either corrupted or missing.

            Sorry for the late response... I've been busy with school work so I didn't want to try the first method and lose my work. I tried the first method but as it told me i skipped step 4 due to it being my first time running through the steps. I am now going
 back and doing step 4 with all the other steps, due to it still having the installing updates issue. If it works hoorah, if it doesn't I guess I'll be coming back here xD.

            Alright, so while i tried to reset my windows update components again ,and i was typing the codes for step 6 and i was resetting the BITS files. Many times for one specific file that i typed into the command prompt, it would come up and say the file was
 been reset but has not connected fully, and it said the file it could be corrupt and needed to be debugged. The thing is though I already did the system file checker, it said none of my files were corrupt, so I don't know what is going on there. This is the
 second time I tried to &nbsp;reset the components through the command prompt so I did do step four of the since it was my second time trying to reset windows components through command prompt. It still isn't working &nbsp;X_X Please help...

            I re-tried with the dism.exe after i ran the windows update fix tool it still said i had missing or corrupted files..... everything worked smoothly in the command prompt and it said there wasn't any problems.... but there has to be if the windows update
 tool keeps saying the files are corrupted or missing. Here are some snap shots. The very last one is me trying to run a system in command prompt to find the corrupt/missing files.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a6961be-fd12-46e9-aa70-01ec3ceaffc7" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b97f5633-b4f5-4ead-a050-afedc07ce1f3" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25f1f15c-a995-4662-ab53-1e23de4242ce" />

<p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wireless router's password can be changed through the router's configuration webpage. Follow these steps to change it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Click <strong>Network &amp; Internet. </strong></li><li>Click <strong>Wi-Fi.</strong></li><li>Select your Wi-Fi network and look for the <strong>IPv4 address</strong>. Routers commonly use 192.168.1.1, but it depends on your router, so it's important to check.<br />
</li><li>Launch a web browser like Microsoft Edge and type the IP address in the address bar.<br />
</li><li>You'll be prompted for a username and a password. The most common default username is
<strong>admin</strong> and the most common default password is <strong>password</strong>, or there may not be a password at all and you can leave it blank. If this doesn't work, consult the manual for your router or contact the device manufacturer.</li><li>Once you're successfully logged in, find the wireless settings area and change the password.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you were able to change the Wi-Fi password after following these steps.
</p>
<p>

<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(also Windows 7)<br />

<br />
===========================================================<br />
<br />
The drive or the controller has likely failed though it can be cabling or other causes. If possible<br />
remove ALL power and then check and&nbsp;reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends
<br />
when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xED: UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME<br />
</strong><br />
The UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME bug check has a value of 0x000000ED. This indicates that the I/O subsystem attempted to mount the boot volume and it failed.</p>
<p>Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code<br />
If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer, Contact Support.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<p>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.<br />
Scan your computer for computer viruses.<br />
Check your hard disk for errors.</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: ED&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000ED&nbsp; &lt;-- read this though its likely hardware error</strong><br />

<br />
=============================================================</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot (if you can as you can).</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<p>Olá Calebehrp, tudo bem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quando você diz que as LANs estão abertas, você quer dizer que o NAT do xbox está aberto? Você poder verificar isso?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Para verificar qual o tipo de NAT que você está, acesse o link abaixo:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Também verifiquei que neste momento o serviço do Xbox está passando por alguns problemas que podem afetar organização de partidas entre outros.</p>

<p>Olá amigo, já que você falou que aparentemente esta tudo funcionando legal com sua internet,&nbsp;</p>
<p>minha primeira dica é remova sua conta do console, depois faz login de novo.</p>

<p>E abre o jogo...<br />

<p>You need to make sure you are all on the same version of the game. If you are signed up for beta you wont be able to have friends join you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1.10. is the one that is currently out for the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure that you have an active Gold subscription as it is required for online/multiplayer gaming.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Programs will not download under Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidbaird55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs will not download under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I think I have a security issue with downloading files under Windows 10 after the upgrade from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Document Explorer with Visual Studio and one of my own programs that uses URLDownloadToFile
<br />
can no longer see the internet and come up with a page not available error. <br />
Both these were working fine on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Both programs are in the Windows Firewall list with the allow option set so they can fetch&nbsp;files from the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Norton's 360 and have enabled the programs in that also. </p>
<p>If I turn off the Norton's 360 firewall I still get no connections.</p>
<p>Is there some security setting that I've missed.</p>
<p>I had hoped the upgrade from Windows 8.1 to 10 would have kept the same security settings.</p>
<p>I did turn off some of the settings to let Microsoft access all my actions on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>David.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks it turned out the problem was that the directory that the Temporary internet files were stored in no longer existed after the update to Windows 10. Trying to change this under the Control Panel application for Internet settings failed to change the
 directory as the one that it was trying to move the files from did not exist. The only way to correct the problem was to manual edit the registry key as explained here:</p>

<h2>            Why does DHCP keep getting turned off &#40;Windows 10&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a few users that this happens to. All different laptops but all on Windows 10.</p>
<p>I set up their WiFi adapter properties based on the network. I don't care what they do once they leave work, but while here they have to have a static IP address. I go into Settings - Network and Internet - WiFi - Manage Known Networks and this is where
 I set the IP Address for the adapter. Every known network has a different setting. For one of my users he has a static IP Address while here and a different static IP Address when at our sister company. When he goes home he doesn't need a static IP Address
 so should be able to pick up an IP through DHCP.</p>
<p>When he comes back to work I have to go into Network and Sharing Center - Change Adapter Settings - Right-Click Wireless Network Connection and select Properties - Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) - Properties and select the radio buttons for Obtain
 an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically.</p>

<p>This is happening every day. Any idea how to stop it from happening?</p>

            Hi Jessica
<br />
<br />Try disabling fast boot to see if it helps...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Power options
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings
<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)
<br />
<br />Click Save changes.
<br />
<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.

<p>
</p><p><span>Something doesn't add up here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The users should use static IP address at your place. But you say that, when users come back to your place, you set DHCP and DHCP doesn't hold.</span></p>
<p>

<p>It is confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 you are able to set IP addresses per SSID. So if you go into Settings - Network and Internet - Wifi and click on Manage Known Networks - each network in this list can be setup statically or dynamically. Here at work, when he is connected to
 our network he has a static IP Address. When he is at our sister company he also uses a static IP but he plugs in to the network there so he is not using the WiFi. When he is at home or traveling he uses DHCP. We purposely do not set anything directly against
 the adapter. We leave it set for DHCP so that the "Known Networks" handle their own settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He has been using this laptop for over a year and was running fine until a couple weeks ago. Now it has this issue and I have to fix it every morning that he is here. Why would that setting change itself after he leaves here? Especially since every other
 connection that uses the WiFi is DHCP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jessica</p>

<p>Ok so I double checked those services and they are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some digging and found out that this started happening after they got NetExtender for Sonicwall working. So I am going to reach out to Sonicwall and see if they are aware of any issues between NetExtender and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still love to hear anyone's ideas on what else might help resolve this.</p>
<p>

<p>Ok so to update - I haven't gotten a chance to reach out to Sonicwall yet but found that updates were not downloading. When I tried to force them the WiFi adapter reset itself like it does when it reboots. So I rolled back the driver on the adapter. No difference.
 Went online to Intel to get the latest driver package. Downloaded it from another computer to a thumb drive and installed it on the laptop. Flipped the setting to DHCP and retried updates. It looked without resetting the adapter. It wasn't finding the 1809
 update so I went to the download site to force the update. I gave his laptop back to him to use while the update is downloading and installing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update as soon as the 1809 update has finished installing.</p>
<p>

</p><p>By the way, I had asked you to check dependencies of the two services if they were all enabled and on. Did you check them ?</p>

<p>Yes I did check those services. Everything was running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also made sure that the box for Connect automatically when this network is in range is checked. I also have the box for Connect even if the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID) checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter will fix it every time but he brings it to me to fix anyway. Every time it's rebooted, shutdown and turned back on, or even if the adapter is reset, it automatically switched itself to Use the following IP address and I have to switch
 it back to Obtain an IP address automatically.</p>

                    <p>Original titlle: Windows 8.1 upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to install the Windows 8.1. upgrade, but it has always stopped at&nbsp;one point with the text&nbsp;"we couldn't&nbsp; the system reserved partition".&nbsp;Error code&nbsp;0x1900104. I had earlier&nbsp; 8.1. preview installed and it worked well until due to an optional graphics
 update the screen went black and&nbsp;didn't open any more. I had to reinstall Windows 8 to get the system working. Now I also did the "refresh", but still the same error message popped up. Is there any way to get past that point and get the win 8.1. installed?
 I have win 8 pro.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

 program&nbsp;and several different drivers&nbsp;(usb, wifi).</p>
<p>Thanks to all for their sharing and good luck to those who are still attempting to&nbsp;upgrade.
</p>
<p>To my mind the Windows' technicians&nbsp;should gather &amp; publish&nbsp;a "how to" list of all&nbsp;the successful procedures&nbsp;people have&nbsp;done before&nbsp;getting the upgrade up and running.</p>

<h2>            How do I retrieve my full windows product key, if It&#39;s missing a few numbers or letters&#63;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my laptop to windows 7, a store bought version, and have had to wipe my memory and re-install windows. Unfortunately the product key sticker was on the bottom of my laptop and a few numbers or letters have rubbed off, does anyone know
 where or how I could retrieve the entire product key or get &nbsp;a new one (legally and without buying one, since I'm not spending more money on a company that hasn't helped me at all, so far)

            I am not sure what you have.&nbsp; If you purchased a true Windows 7 Upgrade, then the product key is inside the DVD case, usually on a card.<br />
<br />
If you have a product key sticker, then you purchased an OEM version and installed Windows 7 instead of upgrading to Windows7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any OEM product keys replacements are to be handled by the OEM installer.<br />

<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey 
<br />3. Hit Enter 
<br />This will show your Windows Product ID
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate 
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

            That's ok.  That command is to get your product id.  Alternatively, you can download a utility that does the same.  Here is a link.

<p>I'm male so I'll definitely be making a male character. I'm not sexist or anything, but it honestly does bother me when people don't choose their same gender. Like I said, I'm not sexist, but when I see a male character I would prefer that the person controlling
 it be a male, and vice versa with female characters/players. It's not a big deal if they don't though.</p>

<p>Tough call for me. In some ways I want my character to represent me, but at the same time, I'd rather watch a female character than a male...</p>

<p>When given the option for Male/Female I choose male. It seems, for me anyway, that if I choose a female character over a Male character, I lose some of the emersion of the game. And like I said it's just personal opinion &amp; preference.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you use Max Payne 3 multiplayer as a guide/example a lot of players choose a Female character for some reason.</p>
<p>Either way what other people choose doesn't bother me. As long as I'm having fun is all that matters to me.</p>

<p>Checking out her butt isn't my reason, I just like the option in Skyrim all but one of my characters are female.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Video games are a place I go to do things I can't in real life, and I can't be a chick. Just like I can't go in the street and blast away a dozen cops. But the main reason I am choosing to go male in GTA Online is the fact that it looks permanent when you
 make a character and if I have to pick once I'd go dude, mainly for immersion reasons.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Its like a 55/45 Split though I may end up being a female after all, just depends.</p>

<p>Not going to lie, I debated using a female just to watch the guys kiss *** and give me an extra cut of cash and whatnot. But since I'm a guy, I'll use the male character. It would take away from the experience if I didn't I think.
