<h2>            Missing files after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my computer from Windows 8.1 to 10 last night, this morning I discovered that the files and folders I had stored on my desktop were missing. I searched for them in the file finder and found them all stored in some obscure folder so I moved
 all those items to my desktop. Later in the day I reset my computer and got the "Hello!" screen and then a few "Please wait..." while my computer was configured. After the process finished, again my computer was missing all the files and folders from my desktop.
 This time when I try and search for the file names nothing is being found. There is nothing in my Windows.old folder either. Is there anyway to recover these files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My Recycle Bin is also empty just in case you think I deleted the files by accident)</p>

            Only thing to add to Jared_146 is that in my case, only documents (.docx and .pdf, etc...) files are missing.... Pictures that were on my desktop are still there...&nbsp; Checked everywhere.... Unable to locate them.

            <p>We're experiencing similar issues with windows 10.</p>
<p>Our software is stored in folders directly off c:\</p>

<p>SMSS-PFRO-1ea4.tmp</p>
<p>SMSS-PFRO-1ea4.tmp</p>
<p>
</p><p>all the files in the original folder were moved, nothing was lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>in the original folder were 3 files. (manifest files) named cusauc, aucinv, and aucmail</p>

            <p>You might have luck locating your missing files in the recycle bin within your one drive account online. What I've been experiencing is One Drive attempting to reinstall itself with each system boot up. What originally started this cycle, I'm not sure, but
 now each time onedrive runs its set-up, an alert notification pops up with the options of merging my existing folder with the new instance or selecting a new location. Its done &nbsp;this twenty times now, so I believe I've exhausted all possible outcomes. Another
 thing, inside onedrive settings there is a drop down menu which provides the option to save documents on either the local pc or in onedrive. Selecting onedrive will unity the documents folders inside &nbsp;your user profile and the documents folder within onedrive.
 They appear to be two separate locations but for as long as the option in settings is checked, they will be one in the same. When one drive tried to install again upon the next boot, the new instance moves the old one to recycle, incuding your documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I just remember what started this cycle. The office upload cue. Do not check I'd the option to work on office docs I'm onedrive. It creates a syncing error which snowballs to ****.</p>

            <p>We recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>We found the original files and moved them to the Documents folder.</p>
<p>After a reboot, all those files are no longer there.</p>
<p>Unsure what happened, and now we cannot find those documents either in the Documents folder or the Original folder prior to us moving them.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>It's hard to fathom that they were deleted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are not in the Recycle Bin either.</p>
<p>Any and all help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Sounds like what basically happened is that when you restarted, it completed the upgrade and replaced your folders with the now empty folders and over wrote your documents/files with nothing/empty folders (because you had manually moved them over). Exact
 same thing happened to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several frustrating hours with Microsoft/Windows 10 support, I was told there was nothing they could do...but they did offer to sell me games and entertainment services subscription (exactly what I needed! Not) and I was ultimately told that I would
 have to pay for some kind of recovery software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lesson learned: back up EVERYTHING even if they say it isn't necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have at least liked a "sorry this happened to you" comment somewhere along the way but no luck on that front...</p>

            <p>oh yeah, windows 10 does that</p>
<p><strong>its known to delete anything that anyone had saved on the desktop</strong>, been a known problem forever now,&nbsp; guess Microsoft does not care to fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the th2 update was removing peoples programs that they had installed, without anyone's permission</p>
<p>
</p><p>but no prob, just restore from your backup, oh wait you didnt make one?, because Microsoft didn't tell you that you should because windows 10 is a huge data loss risk,&nbsp; should so you didn't know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>yeah your stuff is gone<br />
</p>
<p>but your not alone, windows 10 kills people's stuff every day around here</p>

<h2>            Windows XP and RAW files</h2>
                    Windows XP doesn't recognise the RAW files on my camera (Nikon D80)&nbsp;and converts them to JPEGs. How can I stop this?&nbsp; It also doesn't recognise the camera as an external storage device but my deskto does.

</blockquote>
=======================================<br />
More than likely the RAW files are not being converted <br />
to JPEG. The settings of your camera are probably im-<br />
porting both RAW and JPEG and the one only you can <br />
see is the JPEG.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following codec would be worth a try:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
NEF Codec (aka Nikon RAW Codec) 1.14.0<br />
<a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Nikon_RAW_Codec.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Nikon_RAW_Codec.htm</a><br />
<br />
Something to try:<br />
<br />
I don't know if it would help...but you can launch the <br />
Scanner and Camera Wizard as follows:<br />
<br />
The executable for the Scanner and Camera Wizard is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiaacmgr.exe<br />
<br />
If you connect your camera via USB / turn it on /&nbsp; and <br />
go to...Start / Run...and type or Copy/Paste the following <br />
and press...Enter...it should launch the wizard:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\wiaacmgr.exe<br />
<br />
OR.....<br />
<br />
If you happen to have an internal or external USB Media <br />
Reader try the following steps.<br />
<br />
Insert the memory card in the correct slot on the Media <br />
Reader...if any windows open...close them.<br />
<br />
When the card is inserted...if you go to...Start / Computer...<br />
is the card reader listed as one or more Removable Disks?<br />
<br />
Removable Disk (E:)<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
<br />
If_Yes_you can download the photos from there. Left clicking<br />
the drive letter that corresponds to the SD Card slot should<br />
display the directory of the card and you can copy/paste or<br />
drag/drop the photos of your choice to a folder on your hard <br />
drive. <br />
<br />
Just right click a selected group of photos and choose...Copy...<br />
then navigate to the folder you want them in and right click the <br />
folder and choose Paste.

            <p>XP does not recognize cameras as external storage.</p>
<p>In My Computer it is under <strong>Cameras and&nbsp; Scanners</strong></p>
<p>In Device Manager it is under <strong>Imaging devices</strong></p>
<p>In Computer Management it does not show up under <strong>Removable Storage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP cannot open, read or convert RAW images.</p>
<p>Cameras that take RAW images can take just&nbsp;regular, just raw or both at the same time.</p>
<p>Your raw image should have a file extension .NEF</p>
<p>Check your settings on your camera&nbsp;again, and check to see if you have any .nef files in your folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are shooting RAW then you most likely&nbsp;have Adobe Photoshop which can also import your pics.</p>
<p>See&nbsp;what version of&nbsp;RAW your&nbsp;Photoshop has.</p>

<p>See what version of RAW your camera needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most versions have a camera raw update and if your version cannot open raw you can download the free Adobe DNG Converter which will convert your raw files to .dng (digital negitive)
</p>
<p>If you like working with raw you should download it anyway as it supports over 350 different camera models so if someone sends you a raw file Photoshop cannot open you can convert it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Only Allows Stereo on My New Samsung 5.1 System</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an up-to-date Windows 10 computer with an RX 480 graphics card outputting sound (via hdmi) to my new
<a href="https://www.costco.com/Samsung-HW-KM57C-Soundbar-with-Wireless-Subwoofer.product.100337642.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Samsung HW-KM57C</a>&nbsp;which in-turn outputs video to my monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows is only allowing stereo</span> to output to these speakers. This entirely defeats the purpose of me purchasing a 5.1 surround sound system. I'm sure you can imagine how unhappy I was when
 I set everything up and only got stereo sound to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a way to force Windows to output 5.1?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are my options?</strong></p>

</p><p>You might check the settings of the graphics card to make sure it output is set correctly.. I just checked mine and found no Audio Output settings to my surprise...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is with Microsoft furnished AMD drivers. If I were to install the latest directly from AMD or the card's manufacturer they may be there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is that your audio is going through a different device..</p>
<p>My audio output is currently being controlled by a Realtek chip...</p>
<p>There is a control panel for the Realtek that provides settings for 2.1, 5.1, and etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click on your Volume Icon and select "Open Volume Mixer" it may give a clue as to what is in use..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a separate sound chip there may be an icon for it on the Taskbar..</p>

            Microsoft has already released the patches for all Windows 10 versions. You need to tell us the version of Windows 10 you are running so that we can help you better.
<br />Settings&gt;System&gt;about should show you the version of Windows 10 installed.

    <title>Win 10 Home 1803 can&#39;t install printer drivers for network printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve-garry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Home 1803 can&#39;t install printer drivers for network printer</h2>
                    <p>So, the subject pretty much sums up the issue, I have a new Lenovo laptop that won't install a network printer. (Ricoh AP3800C) Yes, it's an old printer that is end of Life from Ricoh, but they released drivers that are still working for every other Win
 10 machine I have, and they still work on one machine that's running 1809, which is more recent than the version that's currently running on the new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Windows update to download the printers, it doesn't find the needed driver any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is, I have 2 other Win 10 computers that are working very happily with this printer, and one of them is on a later version of 10, but in both cases, the drivers were installed under an much earlier version of 10. That's how I found what's working,
 I did a test page on the working machines to get the driver version, previously, Windows Update found and installed them with no issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the drivers in the update catalog by Google searching for the driver version (6..1.7233.0)&nbsp; and downloaded them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They won't install from the .cab download, so I have tried unpacking them into a stand alone folder and installing via the printer install routine (have disc) but one driver fails with a missing file, and the other thinks I'm trying to use the wrong driver
 for the device, despite the fact that it's installed on the other machines and working fine. I can't find any install logs that might provide a clue about what's going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent nearly an hour on the phone with support on this, and that ended with me deciding to end the call before I lost my temper, as the relevant rep would not take ownership of the issue, she was trying to blame the hardware manufacturers, which was unacceptable,
 given I have other hardware that's working completely correctly, the only difference now is a newer version of Win10, everything else is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What then makes it more annoying is that there is a relatively easy fix, using printmanagement.msc, but for reasons best known to Microsoft, that option is not available in Win10 Home edition, (I have both Home and Pro here) so I can't export the working
 configuration from a working machine to import into this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nett result is that I have a mid range (pricey) laptop that I can't use, because I can't print from it, and I'm not about to throw a perfectly good printer and a lot of spares and consumables out because Microsoft have yet again broken a working system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to find out where the drivers are stored on the working machine and install across the network? If not, it looks like I don't have a Windows future, as moving to another hardware device is unlikely to resolve this, and throwing out a good
 working printer is unacceptable, the replacement cost is unsustainable right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any ideas or suggestions.</p>
<p>

<p>It is as simple as this. You have to install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is drivers and software for Windows 7 here. Change OS to Windows 7 64bit, if you have 64bit OS. Get 32bit if you have that, which I doubt.</p>
<p>Then download the packages.</p>

<p>Well, that helped a little, I have managed to get one driver (PS) to install, with some pain, as the drivers are packaged with a utility to unpack that needs XP compatibility and administrator access to run partially correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PCL driver is found, but won't complete the install, it keeps looping back, and never completes the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line, I am still convinced that the problem is down to changes that have been made in the core structure and contents of Win 10, in that I never had issues like this installing the same device on earlier builds, it worked, albeit with
 a download of the printer catalog from Windows update. That option no longer finds the driver for this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partial success, I need to see if the PS driver can do what's needed, it should but I've tended to use the PCL driver historically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the pointers, I will revert if I get any further success.</p>

<p>Skip the Mini driver, which is the 2nd one listed in previous comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And only if Windows has a generic driver for 10 for basic connection and use, you would not have installed this in normal mode. Because it only has drivers and software for 8 and prior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you originally had it connected with a Windows 7 or 8 OS. And then you did and upgrade to Windows 10 and kept files and settings, then Windows would have reinstated it in Windows 8 or prior. That is why many people upgrade and their software or devices
 work (USUALLY). But then after another update or upgrade from like W10 v1709 to v1803, then the software or device is not working. So then they try and reinstall it in 10 mode or normally, when it has to be installed for the version the software and drivers
 are for. But Microsoft does provide 95% of motherboard drivers for PC's about 4 years and older, as the OEM's do not create new drivers for newer Windows OS's. So Microsoft develops generic drivers and provides them. And some external devices like printers,
 Microsoft might provide them for Windows 10 if the OEM doesn't, or the OEM just supplies the drivers to Microsoft and it is on the Windows 10 install disk or through windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, disconnect it, uninstall everything in programs and features</p>
<p>restart PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now install everything, but this time try and use XP compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And install the unix, that I did not list last time and below on bottom is Software with many listed. Not sure what is there when you select them, but maybe tools for fixing issues.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Remote Control buttons</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Bluetooth Remote Control profile in Windows 10. Almost all buttons for remote control of my Spotify player works fine (next/prev song) but button to start/stop doenst wokr at all in Spotify. Button works fine in Media Player
 or Voice recorder but not in Spotify. Back in time when i had Windows 7 everythink works fine until driver update for Bluetooth and it staies that way after upgrade to Windows 10. Is there enything i can do to allow spotify intercept this one button? As I
 mentioned next/prev buttons works in spotify well, just this one button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

<p>Hi Colamarco,</p>
<p>Close all other applications, including your anti-virus suite and install/uninstall software. (REF:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/software/33547-2329-error-message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/software/33547-2329-error-message.html</a>)</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, start the installation with Windows Installer logging enabled. (<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/install-msi-packages-logging-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install MSI Software Packages With Logging Using the Right-Click Menu</a>) And
 then analyze the log file.</p>

<li>Have you tried changing the screen resolution to something quite low, say 800x600, and then back to your normal desktop resolution?</li><li>Does it look OK in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>, in which case you may be able to get at control panel from that.</li><li>Does your monitor have an 'auto configure' button, in which case try pressing that. It can sometimes help.</li><li>Or Does your monitor have vertical and horizontal adjustments to drag the screen back to the right?</li><li>Some video drivers have configuration settings built into them, usually accessible from the task tray (near the clock). Do you have one, and can you get at any adjustments there?</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If all else fails, unlock your taskbar (right-click it and untick 'lock the taskbar') and drag it to the right hand side of the desktop. You should at least then be able to get at start and control panel etc.</p>

            Hello CarlosAzevedo2, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Down below I will provide some steps from Microsoft Store Support that will help you with your issue. Be sure to try all of them as they may work for you.
<br />
<br />-Check for connection problems and make sure that you're signed in with a Microsoft account.
<br />-Make sure Microsoft Store is up to date: Select Start  &gt; Microsoft Store, then select See more  &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Get updates. If an update for Microsoft Store is available, it will start installing automatically.
<br />-Make sure Windows has the latest update:  Select Start , then select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />-Check your time and location settings: Select Start, then select  Settings  &gt; Time &amp; Language. Select Date &amp; time to verify your time settings and select Region to check your location.
<br />-Reset the Microsoft Store cache: Press the Windows Logo Key  + R to open the Run dialog box, type wsreset.exe, and then select OK.
<br />-Note: A blank Command Prompt window will open, and after about ten seconds the window will close and Microsoft Store will open automatically.

            Hello Carlos,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, try creating new user account and check if Store works on that.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Follow these in order:
<br />1.	Try Wsreset: First see if Windows Store Reset works. This should Reset Windows 10 Store cache and if there is a problem with cache, this would clear it.
<br />           a.	Open Run dialog box(Win+R)
<br />           b.	Type in wsreset and Press Enter
<br />
<br />2.	The next step if Wsreset doesn't help is to Reset the Store app. To do this, follow the steps:
<br />                           a.	Open Run Dialog box( Windows+R key)
<br />                           b.	Type in ms-settings:appsfeatures  and Press Enter(Alternatively, Start&gt;Settings&gt;Apps and features)
<br />                            c.	Locate Microsoft Store
<br />                            d.	Click Advanced Options
<br />                            e.	Locate and click Reset Button
<br />
<br />3.	Reset Windows Update components: Resetting Windows update components might also help. Here is an article on how to do that.
<br />
<br />                    a.	<a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-windows-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-...</a>
<br />4.	Check for necessary services: Windows Store is dependent on some Services. Please check if the services are running and Automatic as given below.
<br />
<br />                 a.	Right-click Start&gt;Run and Type in Services.msc to open Services.
<br />                 b.	Make sure the status of the following services is Automatic and running
<br />                                        i.	Windows License Manager
<br />                                        ii.	Background Intelligence Transfer service
<br />                                        iii.	Cryptographic Services
<br />                                         iv.	Windows Update
<br />                                          v.	Windows Store
<br />
<br />c.	If something is not as intended, you can try Restoring default services
<br />                     <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw3g7llzu6niode/Restore%20services.zip?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw3g7llzu6niode/Resto...</a>
<br />
<br />5.	Repair install: The last Restort is a reinstallation of Windows. You can do a repair install, which keeps everything including your apps and files. 
<br />                                         a.	<a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-do-repair-install-using-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to...</a>

<h2>            lenovo ideapad110 display issue - blurry writing, blue&#47;green tint</h2>
                    <p>hi all</p>
<p>i have a lenovo ideapad110 laptop, still under warranty and its display has just gone wonky. the rgb layers seem out of sync. My screen has been flickering on and off for the past few days before this happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 10 installed, all windows drivers are up to date (completed them half an hour ago) - hasn't helped</p>
<p>I have tried to change the resolution refresh rate from 60 to 50 - option not available</p>
<p>I have reinstalled all lenovo drivers as well - hasn't helped</p>
<p>I have tried to calibrate my screen - hasn't helped</p>
<p>I have also tried to restart numerous times, even a complete power off for a few hours - not helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a few screenshots that include what my display looks like currently as well as my display settings after following numerous websites offering various suggested to change certain settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help? Is this an issue with the latest windows drivers perhaps or must i take a trip back to the retail store I bought the laptop from? I can't afford to be without my laptop for any length of time as i use my personal laptop for work
 purposes.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c05e17c-2a17-4037-ab88-a25a127f4abc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c05e17c-2a17-4037-ab88-a25a127f4abc?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The image that you posted did not properly load, so I suggest that you upload them again so that we can see what you are looking at. One of the best way you can isolate the issue is by starting your computer in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>safe mode</strong></a>. If the issue still occurs during safe mode, then, the issue might be hardware in nature and may need to be repaired or replaced by the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards. </p>

<p>Hi Ariel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken a few more screenshots to get a better idea of what I'm seeing. I'm only trying to do as much as I can at home before having to go back to the store and take it back to have it repaired under the in-store warranty. Warranties by us (South Africa)
 only cover repairs, not replacements and since I use my device for home and professional reasons I cannot afford to go without it for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that it is in fact a hardware issue since the calibration has had no effect at all nor has an update of the on-board graphics driver helped either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first screenshot is the google home page. The red boarder around the image shows me that the RGB colours are misaligned for some reason. The second screenshot shows this much clearer as i made the windows overlap. The third screenshot is a photo from
 my laptop pictures directory. You can see that the people's faces are green in colour - without me having changed any colour settings. I'll upload the original photo to this reply as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The image that I see on your post does not display the green tint on the people's faces. The issue you are experiencing might have something to do with the way the screen is connected to the motherboard, that's why you see discoloration and blurriness. There
 isn't really much that we can do if the issue is hardware related, so it might be best to have that repaired as soon as you can.</p>

<h2>            Shutdown External Fan when computer is in sleep mode&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 and i have an external USB fan hooked up with my computer. Most of the time, i keep my laptop in sleep mode. Although the computer is in sleep mode, the external fan doesn't seem to shut down. Right now, i put computer in sleep and
 unhook power cable from my laptop in order to make the fan stop. However, is there anyway i can turn the USB fan off, when the computer is put in sleep mode?

<p><span>Hi sanjeev40084,</span></p>
<p><span>There should be an option in BIOS to disable USB power on sleep. You can get in touch with the system manufacturer for assistance to change the BIOS
 settings as required.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Warning:<br />
Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</span></em></p>

<h2>            Certificates</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to create a VPN connection, to be used when I am away from home.&nbsp; I have both a laptop and a desktop running Windows 7 Professional svcpk 1.&nbsp; I am using a service from NO-IP.com that updates the IP Address on it's site in the event that the
 external IP address on my Modem/Router changes.&nbsp; I just then only have to remember my own little URL.&nbsp; I have set Type of VPN to IKEv2, Require encryption (disconnect if server declines), Use Extensible authentication Protocol (EAP)/Microsoft: Secured password
 (EAP-MSCHAP v2) (encryption).&nbsp; Now I finally was able to get to the point of&nbsp; connection and received a message (Certificate Required For This Connection).&nbsp; Per the help documents within Windows 7, I created the certificates snap-in, then right clicked on
 the Certificates (Local Computer) pointed to All Tasks and clicked on (Automatically Enroll and Retrieve Certificates).&nbsp; I then receive a pop-up box stating (Certificate auto-enrollment has not been enabled.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have then gone to Local Security Policy&nbsp; (Certificate Services Client - Auto - Enrollment) and changed this to enabled, rebooted the machine and I still receive the same (Certificate auto-enrollment has not been enabled)&nbsp; This has all been done within
 an Administrator Account.</p>

            <p>This error can often be do to data corruption, you may have hard drive errors. &nbsp;Try to run checkdisk...</p>
<p>Open a command prompt and type chkdsk /r&nbsp;</p>
<p>or you can right click on the Windows drive, for example {Local Disk C:} under This PC
</p>
<p>and then choose properties and then Error Checking.. click on check, you may need to restart the computer if it needs to be repaired. Hopefully this will fix the issue, if not you can always try re-installing dotnet framework or repairing it in Add or Remove
 programs.</p>

            <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
It turns out that “machine.config” file (as the error suggests) is the problem. The “machine.config” can be found on the CONFIG folder located under “%SystemRoot%\microsoft.NEt\framework\<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">v4.0.30319</span>\config”.
 So:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Logon as admin</li><li>
Go to “c:\windows\microsoft.NEt\framework\<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">v4.0.30319</span>\config” and rename “machine.config” to something like “machine.config.BAD”</li><li>
In the same location create a folder called TEMP</li><li>
Copy “machine.config.default” from the CONFIG folder to TEMP folder</li><li>
Go into TEMP folder and rename “machine.config.default” to “machine.config”</li><li>
Copy “machine.config” from TEMP folder back to CONFIG folder</li><li>
Restart your machine</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Your C00CE556 error should be solved.</p>

<br />To go above that number of participants, you would need skype for business:

<h2>            How to avoid scam call</h2>
                    <p>I just got a call from a company which says it has nothing to do with Microsoft but they say that my computer is messaging them telling them that I have a problem. When I asked, they took me to event log and said that all the warnings and errors listed over
 the past year are slowing down my computer and I should pay them to fix this. I hung up. How do they have my phone number, and is my computer in communication with them?</p>

            <p>It is a scam. They either buy your number from phone or other providers or just</p>

            <p>No, your computer is not in communication with them. &nbsp;You did the right thing by hanging up. &nbsp;They are persistent and will bother you yet more times. &nbsp;Use the link Billion Debarma gives in his reply to learn ways to deal with these criminals. &nbsp;I finally
 had to threaten to contact my state's attorney general's office about their ignoring my state's no call list before they took me off of their call list. &nbsp;But my advice is not to let them engage you in pointless conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of them got mad at me and claimed he was going to shut down my computer. &nbsp;That was a month ago. &nbsp;My computer still works. &nbsp;</p>
