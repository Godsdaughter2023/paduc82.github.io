<h2>            Saving an OFX file to windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi, can anyone help? I need to download my bank statements as an OFX file and save to the computer to then upload to Xero Accounting . I have two problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1<span>) I need to save it as an .OFX file - my computer does not give me this option, without first selecting a programme to open it, of which there is no compatible programme on offer.</span></p>
<p>2) In trying to do the above, I have inadvertently selected Microsoft Office 2010 as the default programme and it wont let me change it. I have been through the settings and via the app store but it does not give me any options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded GnuCash which will open and read the file (saved in the programme above) but it wont let me save it in any other format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried changing the file Properties but have nothing compatible to change it to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this or can anyone make any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance :)</p>

<p>What web browser are you using? Even if you don't have an app installed to read the file, you should still be able to download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now that's assigned to an Office program, the file association can't be changed unless another app tells Windows it can open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it seems like Excel can open OFX files. Open Excel, and go File&gt;Open. In the bottom right of the Open window, there's a dropdown menu to select file types. Change it to "all files", then open your OFX file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Excel can open OFX files, you can try this to assign it to Excel:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In File Explorer, right-click the OFX file and choose "Open with" or "Open with&gt;Choose default app"</p>
<p>In the app picker, click "more apps". If Excel isn't in the list, scroll down to the bottom and choose "Find an app on this PC". Excel 2010 is usually located in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE" or "C:\Program Files
<strong>(x86)</strong>\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE"</p>

            <p>I faced the same problem with Win10 (64 bit) and tried several alternatives. &nbsp;I currently use the same HVR-1250 TV Tuner card with full functionality under Win10 Pro. I ended up using Huappauge WinTV-8 ($10 for the CD) with Win10 drivers from Huappauge to
 view and record TV--over-the-air digital shows. I tried MediaPortal and gave up that option early after dozens of users found MS Win10 update deleting any old Vista 64 bit drivers and apps (killed my old other brand TV tuner cards)! &nbsp;So, it isn't just losing
 Windows Media Center, Win10 Updates can make an older TV card useless if they used old VISTA 64 bit drivers that used to install with Win10--I hate that fact!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantages of WinTV-8 are many, but I found the simple free built-in scheduler interface for Titan TV provided with the CD to be really neat! &nbsp;Did I mention free Titan TV scheduling? &nbsp;The CD installation package created a separate icon for Titan-TV that
 calls and schedules recordings from the Titan-TV schedule page by simply clicking on their web site schedule red "record" button. &nbsp;After scheduling, you can call up the scheduler app from the WinTV menu and edit the schedule event entry, made from the Titan
 page, to further schedule changes to repeat the record event daily, weekly, weekdays or just weekends--Terrific flexibility! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, you can customize the WinTV working and storage directory and video output quality and format to what you need! &nbsp;I use 'as broadcast' quality .mpg format for DLNA streaming to my smart TV and networked devices. &nbsp;WinTV-8 can automatically convert
 the recorded .TS format videos to .MPG! &nbsp;I get a half hour show recorded using about 200 MByte file size (with commercials). &nbsp;You can use MCEBuddy also to automatically convert from .TS to .MPG and strip most commercials. &nbsp;I hate commercials! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found Plex &nbsp;Media Server most stable under Win10 for DLNA services, but still use Win10's WMPlayer &nbsp;to manage my media libraries to assign Genre to recorded and streamed videos. &nbsp;I actually have better &nbsp;flexibility for DLNA media streaming. &nbsp;Questions?
 Please keep asking! &nbsp;:-)</p>

<h2>            &#34;Error 0x80070057&#58; The parameter is incorrect&#34; occurs when trying to copy files</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be a common issue, but none of the other posts helped with my specific situation. I bought and downloaded a game off Gumroad.com that runs in "Famous Writer", and I even installed QuickTime 6.5, as the game's ReadMe instructed. (Note: the game/visual
 novel was originally in Japanese, and I bought the English patch, if that's important.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All should be well, expect every time I attempt to extract the game files so that I can run them, I get "Error 0x80070057: The parameter is incorrect" for the following files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>application:x-FamousWriter.icns</p>
<p>type: ICNS file</p>
<p>
</p><p>text:plain.icns</p>
<p>type: ICNS file</p>
<p>
</p><p>._text:plain.icns</p>
<p>type: ICNS file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also encountered the same error message for "Resources", "Mac", and "Contents", though I don't get them as often. (Yes, I have tried extracting multiple times.)</p>
<p>I tried "Skip" a few times on these error windows, and one time it did extract and I could run it, however there wasn't ANY sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not fantastic with computers, so if anyone can help and put it into simple terms, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit - perhaps I should note that the visual novel is called Holiday Star</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 already has a built-in equalizer but it will still depend if your sound driver supports it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the equalizer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Sound</strong> then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select your playback device under the <strong>Playback</strong> tab and click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Enhancement</strong> tab and choose<strong> Equalizer</strong>.</li><li>Choose the setting you like on the <strong>Settings</strong> drop-down box. You can also customize your own setting by pressing the ellipsis icon beside it.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK</strong> to complete.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not seeing the <strong>Enhancement</strong> tab, we recommend updating your sound driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>

            <p>you would probably be better off disconnecting the D: drive, booting from the win7 dvd and commencing the install process, and in the early part deleting all partitions found, before continueing to allow win7 to utilise all the disk space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allthough its not clear what size the drive is, 27gb+23gb+whatever was win7. If the drive is 100gb or less you would probably be better off replaceing the drive with a larger one.</p>

                    I have been trying to burn a music CD with WMP.&nbsp; When I insert the disc it says MB remaining, instead of time remaining.&nbsp; The files burn to the CD, but seem to show up as data files instead of music.&nbsp; The burner burns DVD's fine, and has no problem burning

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be experiencing this because of a driver problem. You can try installing updates on your Surface by following
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a> to see if the accessory will work properly once it's been updated. It will also help if you run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Here's how you can use the tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app (<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>
I</strong>).</li><li>Go to <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>
<p>

    <title>3.5mm Controller Software Downgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> germastat  say:</h3>
<h2>            3.5mm Controller Software Downgrade</h2>
                    
<p>How can I rollback an update on my controller to a previous version?</p>
<p>The latest update causes issues when I use my headset HyperX Cloud headset to listen to the game, and party chat.</p>

<p>Using the same headset on other devices works as it should. I've tried it phones and computers.</p>
<p>I've also tried my headset on another 3.5mm jack controller that was not updated. This worked.</p>
<p>To me, this means the issue is with the controller hardware or software.</p>
<p>I think it is software related because I am able to listen to my own voice through the headset when the certain setting is turned on, on the xbox.</p>

<p>I've tried the recommended steps to update the controller but this doesn't help.</p>
<p>Unless anyone can help me, my next thing to try would be to complain about a defective product that is still under warranty.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Can't edit so posting it here.</p>
<p>The problem is that I can no longer talk, listen to party chat and listen to game chat on the same headset as I once could.</p>
<p>I can listen to game chat and party chat on the same headphones, but the xbox/controller doesn't send the audio form my microphone to any service.
</p>
<p>People in my party can not hear me, and when I record messages, there is nothing recorded.</p>
<p>I can, however, hear my own voice when a certain setting is turned on, on the xbox. (I can't remember the name of this setting right now)</p>
<p>My mic is not muted in any hardware control or any xbox setting that I know of.</p>

</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 1:Try an flat installation of the software</span></p>

                    <span><font>So I tried Everything , and my apple mobile device driver (or any apple driver) isn't showing up under my device manager.
 I'ts under my services but not under my device manager. This is causing neither of my iphones to sync with the computer. Please tell me if there is anyway to manually install the driver, since I followed apple's support for if it was missing, and it&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work.
 My iphone(s) are not even being&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;as a camera or&nbsp;in&nbsp;recovery mode. I also&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;like 80 times(following apples way of completely&nbsp;re installing&nbsp;it) and the driver is still not in the device&nbsp;manager. It's not my usb either since I have 3 usb's
 and neither&nbsp;of my iphone's will still not appear as a device in the&nbsp;device&nbsp;manager.</font></span>

            I appreciate the help, but this does not do anything at all since the problem is with the phone not being recognized as anything or not even showing its connected to the computer. It still charges, yet it does not show up as a device or anything at all.
 And It's kind of ironic is I already contacted apple support and they directed me to you guys.

            I tried that article about 60 times and the problem is that I don't have apple mobile device usb port within my device manager and I have no idea how to get it back on. As I stated above, the computer wouldn't recognize my iphone as a camera nor in recovery
 mode and I followed that article about 23 times and it still did not appear in my device manager. I even tried re-installing EVERY trace of Itunes(as provided in the article) and it was still not in my device manager.

            Yes I have and yes it did since they have apple mobile device usb port in their device manager. Like I stated before, the problem is that I don't have apple mobile device usb port currently installed in my device manager and I don't know how else to try
 and install it since (like I stated "again") it will not recognize my iPhone as any type of device. and I also stated about 3 times above that I posted my issue and they directed me to you.

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for the reply.<br />

I understand that you have issues only while connecting the IPhone to this particular computer. So please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>:&nbsp;I would first suggest you&nbsp;to follow steps mentioned below and see if it helps.</p>

"Services".</strong></li><li>Select Apple Mobile Device and click Stop the service as shown below.</li><li>After the service has stopped, click<strong> Start the service</strong>.</li><li>After the <strong>Apple Mobile Device service</strong> has started again, open iTunes and connect the device.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: If the above doesn't help then, Set the Apple Mobile Device Service Startup type to Automatic.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Close iTunes and disconnect the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.</li><li>Click the Windows Start button .</li><li>In the <b>Start Search</b> field type .</li><li>In the <b>Programs</b> section of the search results, click Services.</li><li>Right-click on <b>Apple Mobile Device</b> and click <b>Properties</b> in the shortcut menu.</li><li>Set the <b>Startup type</b> pop-up menu to <b>Automatic</b> and click OK: </li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If the issue continues after restarting AMDS, then you'll need to remove and reinstall AMDS and iTunes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Completely <strong>uninstall AMDS, iTunes, and all Apple software</strong>. Click the appropriate links below for steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I have <em>exactly </em>the same issue above as posted by Amber.&nbsp; I too have followed
<em>all </em>of the steps above, without success short of uninstalling/reinstalling iTunes.&nbsp; My iPhone is not recognized by iTunes at all, yet my computer does recognize it&nbsp;in Explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8, iPhone 5, and the latest version of iTunes 11.5.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple Mobile Device shows up under Services, I stopped it, restarted it, and set it to automatic, which it already was but I did that anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Apple Mobile Device does not show up under Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted my computer, and turned my iPhone off and back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes still does not recognize my iPhone.&nbsp; Every time I plug my iPhone into my computer it asks if I should trust this computer.&nbsp; I say Yes.&nbsp; Minutes later, it will ask me again if I trust this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have tried my iPhone on another computer and it is recognized by iTunes, but still&nbsp;not my own computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to download and install Apple Mobile Device without removing iTunes and ALL of it's associated programs?&nbsp; I'd hate to have to go that far.&nbsp; I've done that in the past and lost music.</p>

            I'm having the same exact problem this 'Apple Mobile Device Driver' is not popping up under Device Manager at all. I only see it under services. My iPod is not showing up on my computer at all.

    <title>Windows 10 update will not install Directx 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> decharm0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update will not install Directx 12</h2>
                    <p>My Windows will not upgrade to DirectX 12 from DirectX 11.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit ( 10.0, Build 10586), upgraded from Win 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GPU: GTX 580. NVidia's website says the card is DirectX 12 compatible, GeForce Experience says that I have the latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DirectX Diagnostic Tool says: DirectX Version: 11.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update says:&nbsp;Your device is up to date. Last checked: Today, ‏‎3:28 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked on this site and the going theme is to get a newer GPU, update the drivers, and update Windows. But all of these things are up to date and compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there someway to upgrade DirectX for Win 10? Maybe some file I could delete to force update to install the newest DirectX?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solution would be appreciated. </p>

            <p>Yeah i have this problem, but i can't update from DirectX 9ex to DirectX 11.3 but i am running windows 10? I hit check for updates and it said im up to date. But then I tried to play killer instinct, and it said I need Direct3d 11_0 and I only have Direct3d
 9. Please explain why this is happening and if there is no stand alone package to get 11.3 how do i get it? Is it because i dont have a good enugh graphics card that it wont update?</p>

            DX 12 support isn't native in that card. It has to be provided by the NVidia driver. Was supposed to be forthcoming late last year... perhaps it hasn't been implemented yet?

<p>
</p><p>I think so too. I looked at those links but it was pretty iffy.&nbsp;The drivers support a whole range of different card series but not all necessarily are capable of Dx12.&nbsp;The first link states that the gtx580 is a DX11 card and in the DX12 link farther down&nbsp;it
 only mentions DX12 support in&nbsp;the 900 series cards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an indirect source but according to these posts,&nbsp; the Fermi based cards still do not have DX12 support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You declined to offer any specifics on the slower systems, but here are a couple of suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click the<em> Taskbar</em> and select<em> Start Task Manager</em>. Check<em><span> Performance</span></em> tab for computer activity in a supposedly inactive state.

            <p>Hi Jeeped,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- cpu usage is unter 5% at the start time.</p>
<p>- all systems are on the same patch and driver level</p>
<p>- the systems have the same configuration</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>I had no time to check running services but do you think that the program start depends on the running services?</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Creating system repair&#47;recovery&#47;reinstall and&#47;or system image restore on USB flash drive&#40;s&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I want to create some repair/recovery options for myself for my Lenovo laptop (Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The four things that seem to be discussed online are system repair, system restore (of certain files), making an .iso image of the whole drive, and doing a clean reinstall of the whole OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which of these options can be combined on a USB flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've read it may be possible to combine the system repair, restore (of certain files from a previous version) and restore (of the entire disk image), however doing a clean reinstall may require its own thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was going to make the former using MS's DVD-to-USB tool on a 64GB flash and the latter (system reinstall) on an 8GB (all USB 3.0)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this sound like the best way to do it, and/or can all four be put on the same drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ok now you've got me confused ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you mean about putting a sytem image on an external hard drive and keeping multiple copies (like Apple Time Machine?) but would the system restore option really take up that much space on a 32 or 64GB flash drive? (can't you limit its size)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I use a flash drive to access the system image backup? (I would put it on an external hard drive shared with a desktop Mac; I would create a NTFS partition on it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if the system reinstall would still need to be on a separate flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I appreciate it.</p>

</p><p>Ok so it sounds like the system repair is out and the system image and restore should be on an external hard drive (a little tricky for me because my HD is in a location I only go to 1x/month, maybe I'll put the system image on that and get a 64GB flash
 and put the system restore on that and update it 1x/week, it's ok if it's a little slow I'll make sure to get USB 3.0 [my laptop is capable as well]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight on the system (re)install? (I've read some people like to do one 1x/year just to clean the "gunk" out of the system. I guess a separate 8GB flash just for that would only run a few dollars [literally]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks (in advance [again])</p>

</p><p>I don't agree with the yearly re-install idea. The only reason that a fresh install runs fast is because there is nothing holding it back. By the time that you have put everything back on, the computer is back to where it was.</p>

</p><p>I guess I thought there was some way of just restoring your "data" (in the sense of settings, saved passwords, etc.) over a clean "system" (so that doing a period clean reinstall would make sense).</p>

</p><p>so it sounds like i should forget about the clean (re) install and just keep a system image on an external hard drive but i'm still not 100% clear on why i shouldn't make a flash drive for restoring data files (not password I shouldn't have said that, I
 actually use 1Password and Dropbox to coordinate between my Mac desktop and W7 laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to clarify i calculated my data files are about 24GB, if i get a 64GB drive [they're cheap] how slow could it get? (can't you tell it to limit the range of how far the backups go?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for your advice btw, it's amazing to me that this is all so complicated and microsoft doesn't provide some kind of straightforward guide to it all (maybe they do but i haven't found it)</p>

 is too big and takes up too much space. Removing it gives more space for air ventilation. Secondly, although a DVD drive doesn’t take up much power, I know I am saving some (around 20 Watts) from not having it. I do have an external USB slim DVD writer though
 if I really need to use it. Everything can be run from USB nowadays such as Hiren’s BootCD, antivirus rescue discs and even installing Windows 7. I have also started using the Windows 7 system image backup and restore feature, so there is no need to create
 a Windows 7 Rescue Disc in case the boot loader gets wiped off. However, seeing that I’ve already removed the internal DVD drive and try to avoid plugging and unplugging the USB slim DVD writer, I need to install the Windows 7 system recovery onto a USB flash
 drive. There is no easy supported method to do that from Windows itself but here are a few ways we’ve found how to do it. There are other options to get the recovery files on to USB such as using the Command Prompt with Diskpart or using USB bootable creation
 tools such as SARDU, UNetbootin, Rufus, xboot etc, but after testing we found that not all the recovery USB functions work properly. Out of the 5 recovery tools on the “System Recovery options” menu, only the last option “Command Prompt” is working while the
 rest are broken. Clicking on Startup Repair shows the following error: Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically. Sending more information can help Microsoft create solutions. Clicking on System Restore shows the following error: To use System
 Restore, you must specify which Windows installation to restore. Restart this computer, select an operating system, and then select System Restore. Clicking on System Image Recovery shows the following error: An internal error occurred. The following information
 might help you to resolve the error: The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002) Clicking any of the 2 options in Windows Memory Diagnostic shows the following error: Windows cannot check for memory problems. An error is preventing Windows from
 checking for memory problems during startup. To run the Windows Memory Diagnostic manually, boot the computer from the Windows installation disc, and then select Windows Memory Diagnostic from the Windows Boot Manager menu. If you are getting any of the error
 messages above on your current Windows 7 System Recovery image installed onto USB stick, or want to create a fully working recovery USB from the off, you should use the below methods to create it as we have found that all the recovery option functions work
 as intended. Step One: Creating The Windows Recovery ISO Before you create the recovery USB stick, you must first get yourself a standard Windows 7 System Recovery ISO which can be attained in two ways. One if you have a recovery CD already burned to disc,
 and the second if you have no access to an optical drive. If you have a CD-RW drive the easiest method is to run the recdisc.exe tool from the Search box in the Start menu, burn the image to a re-writable CD and then follow the first method below. First Method:
 From An Existing Windows 7 System Recovery Disc. 1. Download and install the trial version of PowerISO . If you have any other software you like that creates an ISO file from a CD such as ImgBurn etc, you can use that also. Watch out for the adware during
 the PowerISO install. 2. Start PowerISO, then go to the Tools menu -&gt; “Make CD/DVD/BD Image File”. 3. Select the destination file as “.iso file”, then choose a location and filename for the saved file. Make sure the source drive is the correct one. Press OK
 when you’re ready to create. After a minute or two, the ISO will be created ready to put onto USB. Here’s how to create the image using another popular ISO utility called UltraISO instead if you prefer it over PowerISO: 1a. Download and install the trial of
 UltraISO . 2a. Start UltraISO (right click and Run as Administrator), go to Tools menu -&gt; “Make CD/DVD Image“ or press F8. 3a. Click the button to choose a location and filename for the output file, make sure the drive is selected that contains your disc,
 then click Make. The ISO Output Format should be selected by default. On Page 2 we’ll show you how to get the Recovery ISO from a system without an optical drive and write the ISO to USB.</span><br />

    <title>Miracast on W8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Miracast on W8.1</h2>
                    <p>Ive just purchased a Windows 8.1 tablet, and was keen to try out Miracast functionality to my Panasonic blue-ray and TV.</p>
<p>right swipe - Devices - project - add a wireless display - add a device, the tablet seems to find the player/tv, they seem to start to connect and then fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching I found this post <em>( and some other similar )</em> - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/miracast-with-windows-81/b827f491-6624-4736-b0ac-74b720e8c285">

<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm not too upset as I always have the old HDMI cable but it seems odd to me in this day and age of 'standards' that if the above linked information is correct
<em>(and from what else I can find it is)</em> that Microsoft will not speak to Panasonic or vice versa, and get two bits of kit that are supposed to be "miracast compatible" working together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have I missed something? <em>( apart from don't trust large colourful marketing labels on new kit :-) )</em></p>
<p>Has anyone got W8.1 talking to a Panasonic device via miracast by any method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Yer, the blueray player I have has a nice shiny miracast label on it and is supposed to be miracast compatible. It just seems there are various miracast differences from one manufacturer to the next, and once again a "standard" isnt quite as standard as
 the public may have expected, I guess.

<p>I'm not using a surface or surface 2, I'm not using a VPN, and turning the firewall off made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for the pointer. I'm still investigating but I guess it is just a miracast incompatibility between W8.1 and this bit of Panasonic kit maybe?</p>

<h2>            Cloned disk won&#39;t boot, possible fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I'm helping my brother migrate his windows OS from a 500 GB SSD to a 1 TB SSD.&nbsp; After using Clonezilla to copy the original disk and setting bios to boot from the new drive, I'm getting the following errors.&nbsp; First of all, right at the beginning is a
 quick message MBR error3.&nbsp; Then after the windows boot animation appears for a while, there loads either an error screen with a ) and a message about an inaccessible boot device, or a similar error message with the error code 0xc0000225.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is my best option to try fixing this?&nbsp; I've seen some references to using the Windows install disk to do a startup repair, where is the best place to download a startup disk? (The system was upgraded from Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Cannot delete file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eldiener  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete file</h2>
                    I have a file in a directory called "footer." This file was evidently created by some software I have. All my attempts to delete this file come back with:<br />
<br />
"Could Not Find some_long_path\footer."<br />
<br />
Yet the file shows both in Explorer and when I type "dir" from a command window. In Explorer the size says 61 kb, but when I click on the Properties the size says 0 bytes. I cannot change the name of this file either. I have also tried to take ownership of
 this file but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Any ideas for deleting this file would be welcome.

    <title>Windows 10 PC wakes up randomly in the night - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfiebaker1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC wakes up randomly in the night</h2>
                    <p>So for the past 2 months or so, my PC has been randomly waking up in the night/ when I'm not around - I have searched the internet for a fix and seemingly tried everything but nothing has worked. The strange thing as that Event Viewer tells me the times
 this has happened have in at completely random dates and times. For example, the latest time this has happened, Event Viewer says I put my PC to sleep at 23:27:07 on the 21st of the second - which sounds about right - but the wake time is 05:55:39 on the 1st
 of the forth, (if you didn't see the date I posted this) months into the future!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know a fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br />
<br />If the Wake Source says “Power Button,” that indicates that the power button on the PC was pressed to wake it up—an action you most likely took yourself.
<br />If the Wake Source says something like “Device–HID-Compliant Mouse (or Keyboard),” that indicates the PC is configured for key presses and mouse movements to wake it.
<br />If the Wake Source lists your network adapter, that indicates your PC is configured so that incoming network activity can wake it up—something that’s useful if you like having your PC go to sleep but still need it available to other network devices at times.
<br />If the Wake Source says “Timer,” it means that a scheduled task woke the computer. The source information usually includes some indication about the task that woke the PC. For example, in the previous screenshot, I can tell that my PC was woken up in order to do a scheduled restart after an update.
<br />You may also see something like “Wake Source: Unknown,” which is a bit more cryptic but at least it tells when the PC was awoken.

<h2>            It shouldn&#39;t take 3 days to to get a game started&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So this is absolutely ridiculous. I am 37 years old, and I&nbsp;have not had a gaming&nbsp;system other than my iPad since my PS2 in the early 2000's. So my girlfriend gets it in her head I want an Xbox for my birthday yesterday. We go to game stop and buy a brand new XBox One S with 1 Terra and Gears of War 4.</p><p>Silly me, I thought I could go spend $400 on a brand new product, take it home, plug it in and start playing a game.</p><p>I guess I sound really stupid to all the folks out there who have stayed in the gaming scene all these years.</p><p>So I get home after fighting the days&nbsp;after Christmas spoiled teenager crowd at&nbsp;Game Stop, I open my XBox, plug it in and get ready to play...... Ha freaking ha was that the dumbest expectation ever.</p><p>First off, I cant stand how basically all technology these days has to be updated right out of the box. So of course, as soon as I plug my XBox in, I have to start a 1 to 2 hour update process. Is it me or should something bran

            <p>I had a very similar experience. Receiving the system as a gift from my wife. Having had many consoles over the years, a 360 that was retired for the new Xbox one. As my gaming has matured with me over the years I turned to plug and play consoles over PC gaming. Mainly due to less and less time to enjoy it. I too was completely disappointed with the initial setup and wait to play experience. Frustrated with two and a half days before I could actually play a game. Having to download an app to even play a blu ray movie. &nbsp;Having spent some time playing and learning the new system I still haven't completely lost the bad taste it left. I can only hope it continues to Get better than what I have experienced so far.</p>

            <p>Yeah I&nbsp;had purchased the xbox one s as well with GoW4 as well though I&nbsp;got the digital download version.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;new going in a head of time that the newer consoles are basically like little pc's.&nbsp; Games are no longer played from the disc they are installed from the disc as well as updates/patches etc.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;just wrapped the empty xbox box and then spent a week downloading games (digital), updates, apps etc.&nbsp; then put it away for Christmas.&nbsp; Christmas rolls around and low and behold had another update and then controller updates.&nbsp; Then my kids wanted to play games we had purchased physical copies of... HAHAHAHA those took hours of installing and downloading as well.</p><p>It's not ideal by any means... PC&nbsp;is even worse really no a days as you have the physical copy of the game but it insists on downloading the entire game from the net.&nbsp; At least consoles install from the disc and pick up the updates and what not online then.</p>
