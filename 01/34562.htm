</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hey guys, I hope you could help me out here.So my brother activated the built administrator account using cmd in windows 10.He forgot what the password is and we had no password reset disk &nbsp;at that time.So I can only log in to the guest account which is
 a standard account.I can't run anything as administrator because it asks for administrative privileges.Any help would be appreciated, thank you!</p>

The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that.

</p><p>Were you updating through the normal system update in settings, or from a bootable device?

Try going to My Computer: C/Windows/Software Distribution/Downloads and delete the files that are in there (its the download location for system/Windows updates). Then try check for updates and see if the process starts again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 start button and task bar have died with last night&#39;s update</h2>
                    <p>The Gates boys updated windows 10 for me last night (7/13/2016). &nbsp;Today the task bar has died. &nbsp;The start button does nothing. &nbsp;I cannot change volume on the speaker. &nbsp;I cannot search files. &nbsp;What is going on? &nbsp;Windows 10 was a "gift". &nbsp;Does anyone know
 how to talk to a human being at Microsoft who can fix this? &nbsp;Most of the suggestions I have found include starting something with the start button. &nbsp;This is literally a non-starter! &nbsp;I am not the most tech savvy 75 year old I know, and am not comfortable delving
 into Bill and Melinda's software on my own. &nbsp;Any information about a method of speaking to a real human being at Microsoft who can fix this for me without breaking the budget of some third world country would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update and response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management command (DISM).
</span></p>
<p><span>It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Click <strong>command prompt (Run as administrator)</strong>. </span></li><li><span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press
<strong>Enter</strong> key after each command: </span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type <strong>Exit</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:<strong> Clean Boot</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>
How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Carry over email files to Windows 10</h2>
                    I use the outlook.com email app and have created folders in this app to store certain emails. I've no idea whether these files are in the cloud or on my computer. When I convert from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 will these email folders carry over? Should
 I back them up like all my other files before the conversion and if so, where do these folders appear in File Explorer? Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>If you're concerned about Outlook.com, then it won't be impacted with Windows 10 Upgrade, since all&nbsp;emails are stored online. You only need to be concerned, if you have&nbsp;any important files or programs that are saved on your PC. Even though your files, settings
 and installed application won't be affected during upgrade, but we still recommend you to a backup of all important files for safer side.</p>

            I have got the Store to finally open, but no other big apps will open, (calculator will open) I have done so much to get this working but nothing seems to fix it... Mail will open with blue background and the mail icon in center of screen for about 2 sec,
 then disappears and the desktop appears, but the icon is still on my taskbar, only thing I can do is right click and close program... This is a new all in one desktop I only have my POS system installed.

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>as long as you have windows XP SP2 it should work, just make sure both the receiver is blinking and the controller'slight is doing circles at the same time. If I've seen correctly I didn't see them both doing that at the same time in your video.</p>
<p>Just as additional info I'll add the support page for connecting a controller to a wireless receiver for a PC: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/xbox-controller-for-windows-setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../xbox-controller-for-windows-setup</a></p>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer!</p>
<p>"If I've seen correctly I didn't see them both doing that at the same time in your video."</p>
<p>Okay, now I tried both at the same time, with the same results.</p>
<p>I believe I've already read the link you've provided, but I will go through it again, and post whether it fixes the issue.</p>

            <p>Ok, do you have the option to try and connect the controller to an Xbox 360, to check out that works, if it does then try connecting to the wireless receiver contracted to the PC once more. Or try the setup on a different PC.</p>

<h2>            Downloaded signature edition content, can&#39;t play without being LIVE&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My friend got the Dragon Age Signature Edition game, but she doesn't have Xbox LIVE so she came to my place to download the extra content (The Exiled Prince and The Black Emporium).</p>
<p>Now she can't load that file at her place because she doesn't have Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>My question is if she can fix this in any way? It seems weird that you can't play Dragon Age without being LIVE.</p>

<p>Sorry, but the extra content won't work without a connection to XBL. &nbsp;Just more cr*ppy copy protection schemes they inflict upon the innocent (a pirated version doesn't have this problem).</p>
<p>I've played the game with The Black Emporium on another Xbox and all I needed was my gamertag on a memory module.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Internet Explorer 11 and &#34;Favorites&#34;. SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>Just received a fairly new computer back from the shop where I had to have the SSHD reimaged with Windows10.&nbsp; The computer seems to have developed and issue with its "Favorites" file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You can not easily arrange the contents of the file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) The "Favorites Bar" folder - the system keeps trying to make it the FIRST folder in the list of links and folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can move it up, you can move it down, within a couple seconds, it always returns to the top position.
</p>
<p>3) Moving certain folders up or down, is difficult.&nbsp; For example, I have a folder marked "Cars" that I want at the top, but it keeps being reset to the bottom position in the list of folders and links. (It behaves opposite to what the "Favorites Bar" folder
 does. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Chrome on my desktop as well, which I use a great deal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is what would cause this behavior and how does it get fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Edge, I hate the interface.&nbsp; Yes, I understand that in time, Internet Explorer will go away and fade into oblivion.&nbsp; However "Switch to Edge," is not the solution to this issue.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>            Touch input stops in all Electron &#47; Chrome based applications after latest Windows Inside Preview</h2>
                    <p>After I installed Windows 10 OS build 17063.1000 Chrome based applications do not handle touch input anymore. On occasion they work after a restart but then break again very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other applications work fine and all Chrome based applications worked fine up until this latest update. Now that the update has been applied the following applications DO NOT handle touch input anymore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Chrome</p>
<p>- Visual Studio Code</p>
<p>- Atom</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried creating a starter electron application and touch just didn't respond at all. This worked in all prior versions of Windows for me and, like I said, all non-chrome based applications work perfectly fine with touch including Edge and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having the same issue? Microsoft reached out to me on Twitter so I thought I was filing a bug report through them but they just generically pointed me to the forums.</p>

<p>Hi Kasracer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be caused by several reasons. To name some, programs that are still running on the background because of an incomplete process, an outdated program, or a corrupted software brought about by the recent update. We will be checking if this particular
 issue is indeed related to a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, performing a repair upgrade may resolve the issue. Please check <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">How to: Perform a Repair Upgrade Using the Windows 10 ISO file</a></strong> and
 follow the resolution provided in the article created by&nbsp;Andre Da Costa.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: </em>To do an in-place upgrade, here are some of the things youâ€™ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another PC with a reliable internet connection. This will be a 4 GB download. The download time will depend on your internet connection.</li><li>A USB flash drive or DVD. A blank USB flash drive or DVD with at least 5 GB of available drive space. Using a DVD requires a DVD burner and software on the PC youâ€™re using to create the media and a DVD player on the PC where you want to install Windows.

<p>I have figured out a way to reproduce this 100% of the time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first off, Rey I thought about doing what you suggested but it would have been a bit of a pain when I could have just used Firefox and had the same functionality but I wanted to do some digging. I found that when I use the new Windows Key + Tab feature
 (the scrolling window manager) that it breaks touch in Chrome and other Electron based apps. When I sign out or if I NEVER use that feature then touch works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there appears to be a bug in the newly revised Windows Key + Tab feature (honestly I would like to go back to how it worked before, the scroll bar is quite annoying but I'll certainly settle for just getting this bug fixed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a better place to report this so it gets resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Ridiculously low upload speeds and bitrates while renderring and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewogier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ridiculously low upload speeds and bitrates while renderring and uploading video on Upload Studio</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing with the Upload Studio recently, trying to upload various video clips from the launch games.</p>
<p>However, while the clips are quite speedy to render, they take absolutely AGES to upload. I have a 40mbit down / 2.5mbit up connection, but the XBone only uploads at speeds of 0.3mbit to 0.7mbit. This is hair tearingl, frustrating slow! Sometimes it takes
 an hour to upload 5 minutes of footage! This is for both uploading to friends on XBone, and uploading publicly to Skydrive.</p>
<p>I am currently running the XBone over wifi connection on a secured 5ghz connection. Is anyone else having these slow upload speeds? Is it worth me plugging the system into the network via cable to see if there's any improvement?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when videos DO eventually upload, they are at a very low quality and bitrate. For some games like Forza it's acceptable, but for games like Killer Instinct, the quality is so poor that the video becomes blocky and blurred, especially when pulling off
 awesome combos (which is exactly what I want to record).</p>
<p>In FIFA, you can't even see the texture on the grass! It's just blocky green!<br />
<br />

<p>Hey juganawt.I can confirm this. 5 minutes needed around 40 minutes to upload to skydrive with upstream speeds between 0.7 to 1.6 &nbsp;Mbit from my console.
</p>
<p>What really makes it worse is that we are not allowed to close the upload Studio for doing something else while its uploading.</p>

<p>G'day Juganawt! Let's make sure that your console is seeing the full speed capability of your network connection. Have you run a speed test on the console?
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/slow-performance-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Take a look at the steps here</a> on how to do that, and also how to improve the performance of said connection. There's quite a bit of stuff to try, but if you're willing then
 it can definitely help with your uploads.</p>

<p>There could be a number of things here, first as above make sure you xbox is using as much speed as pos!</p>
<p>Also if you NAT type is anything other than open then this will slow you down, WIFI is generally slower on uploads then downloads so your 40/2.5 connection will really be about 30/1.5.</p>
<p>Also worth remembering is that when you upload to Upload and skydrive it has to send it to 2 different places at the same time so this will slow you down to. I ind on my connection I get about 5mb when saving to upload/skydrive but if it save to just upload
 I can reach about 10/15mb (I have a 75/25 connection).</p>
<p>Also it could also be affected by time of day as upload dose seem to be very popular so could suffer at peak times</p>

<p>Just to agree with the OP about the video quality.</p>
<p>I compared a recorded clip to the same clip after running it through upload studio, and the loss of quality is massive.</p>
<p>Let`s hope this will be fixed/updated sometimes.</p>
<p>Speaking of updates, I don`t understand why upload studio limits to 1/3/5 clips when editing.</p>
<p>Why not just allow us to add a clip with a button-press, you can still limit the maximum time if that`s a concern.</p>

<p>so i called cosomer support about this and they told me that right now you can only upload in 480p and that 720p is coming later via os update soon. I am also frustrated with upload studio. hopefully the next os update will fix the ridiculously long upload
 also </p>

<p>30 to 45 minutes for a 2.5 minute clip here. Un-usable.. Network settings are fine to play games with, Xbox One network settings screen is all happy. Something in the pipe between one drive and Upload studio just takes too long. That and the interface is
 ridiculous. Totally obvious the designers didn't try using it the way gamers do. Ever try to delete 90 clips without having to take the day off to do it?</p>
<p>I'd fire that whole UI team.. </p>

<h2>            How do I link contacts in People app to account within the Mail app</h2>
                    <p>I recently imported my contacts from my previous Outlook Express client to the People app, (with help from this community). I understand that I now need to link this to the Mail app. I looked through the 'Help and Tips' but as yet not found anything that
 helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the Mail app I have 2 accounts, The first is the Outlook account, which I assume is the default account based on my sign on, which I don't really use. The second account receives emails from my ISP's mail box and this is the one which I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be apprecriated.</p>

            <p>Hi Diana, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you send a mail from the outlook, then that contact will be automatically stored in the people app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to sync them, as I said earlier The People, Mail, and Calendar apps work together. So when you email a contact from Mail, the app picks up that person's email address the People app (which is where their contact information lives).'</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 driver for thermal 58 receipt printer</h2>
                    I just bought a 58 mm thermal receipt printer for my computer (windows 10). The printer comes with an installation disk but only supports up to windows 8. I have looked for windows 10 drivers online but have had no luck. Can anyone point me in the right
 direction?

<h2>            Windows XP Setting a first Admin password did not work&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
Okay, where to begin. &nbsp;I would prefer not to talk over the phone and can wait for online replies if need be. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well, short story, I am trying to get onto a computer that I recently changed and set the first and only password for an administrator account that I am aware of for an windows xp operating system.<br />
<br />
Now the long story. &nbsp;I am been working to secure everything from a specific terminal. &nbsp;I am not sure who might have a personal vendetta against me or why, but I have to at least try to help keep those I know safe. &nbsp;I know this game between the licensed operating
 computers and hackers, and it never really ends. &nbsp;Luckily, I made some changes to stay some number of steps ahead, but even sending this message will tip them off to what I know. &nbsp;(Someone may have infiltrated and bugged everything, even my ISP and router
 may be bugged, and everyone should be able to freely access information without fear it will be used against them and without having their privacy invaded, right? &nbsp;One fundamental principal of the founding of the United States was the protection against unwarranted
 searches and seizures of information.) &nbsp;Anyway, every day it looks like there is a new way to be phished and the like, and information and data can be intercepted at any time by any middleperson. &nbsp;(Dare I even mention governments or other corporations that
 may try for their own interests, to spy or steal from company that creates the software or end user.)<br />
<br />
As for whoever may be reading this at Microsoft, I understand you do work hard and often do great work, besides a few elements that do flop or have flaws. &nbsp;Unfortunately, obviously enemies, but also friends, and even family and the universe itself works against
 me. &nbsp;(They are often less bright then I: downloading dangerous things, creating more holes, spilling personal details--all the stuff someone who develops common sense learns not to share, and I am not bragging that I am bright by any means, only in certain
 respects, for if I were, I would have never been locked out of the administrative account in the first place. *scratches head*) &nbsp;Now, I don't need to know every security feature and understand that you may not be able to spill everything, but anything special
 that would tell me what is going on would be most helpful. &nbsp;If anyone knows your system, it is you. *wink* (I don't want my attackers to know either.) &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may be asking why I didn't do a full backup on another drive, and it is because I don't have any of equal size. &nbsp;(A good portion of my files are all split onto various removable media, but with older drives different file systems, their space is limited.)
 &nbsp;Also, money is really tight for me right now, so I can't afford any really professional job, but also have seen some amateurs actually do some things and lock up some hard-drives, sometimes writing over a whole drive! &nbsp;(Seriously, most could overwrite something,
 but every professional knows people don't want to lose what they have, and so they make a copy.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Technical details:<br />
<br />
Proof of authenticity: The last character of the license of the operating system ends in W for Windows XP Home Edition. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I definitely have: Copies of most of my programs, updates, files, settings, an actual legitimate copy of XP; I also have a copy of a recent "system state" on a cd, but not sure if that is helpful or not as a wbf file.<br />
<br />
What I might have: &nbsp;Copies of my Windows files, a copy of the encryption key, and the long alpha-numeric-special case password. &nbsp;(Not all of the Windows folder and program files would copy.)<br />
<br />
Major changes: After changing the administrative account name, then first setting a first and second password, and confirming it and it going through, then restarting to see if it worked, it did not. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tried several techniques: Password I thought I set, different combinations and close permutations in case of a double-failed typo, booted into safe mode, but did not actually reset Admin password.<br />
<br />
Goal: to free the system from this end, the terminal, then work my way back through the router, modem, network, etc., with as minimal data loss as possible. &nbsp;The time necessary is not as important as doing it right. &nbsp;(Even would like to keep the old key if
 a new one must happen.)<br />
<br />
Alternatives?: &nbsp;What are all the alternatives or procedures?<br />
<br />
<br />
More details:<br />
<br />
Strange permissions: &nbsp;Some of my last changes were cutting off some shared credentials since it seemed like they were from users that I didn't know ...<br />
<br />
Malware or typical behavior: I didn't think malware might be involved at first, so I was going to try a safe mode workaround I came across on the internet, but after starting it, it seemed like other stuff slowly started to come through? &nbsp;And I didn't follow
 through to change the password because I wasn't sure I could get and reset the account without losing some things like encryption keys, programs, etc. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Safe Mode shuts down: &nbsp;Safe Mode shuts down after a few minutes. &nbsp;(Is it supposed to?)<br />
<br />
Unknown user: &nbsp;If I stay at the windows screen til the screensaver turns on, it says turn off John?<br />
<br />
More processes: &nbsp;Start-ups seem to be happening slower and getting riskier, processes are showing during boot ******.sys ...<br />
<br />
Other remarks: &nbsp;The odds of me knowing the last character and first sending it to through a connection you can partially trace back to me is very slim! &nbsp;<br />
Most of my programs can't be downloaded again because most of the new downloads are "trial versions" with limited times, functionality, or limited versions. &nbsp;(I don't know how programs were installed with permanent licenses, but I am thankful they were!) &nbsp;Also,
 it seems most versions of windows don't come with a start up cd, so I probably don't have one, and if I do, it is not readily available. &nbsp;The password not working on restart was definitely strange behavior. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it did not give any advice about
 passwords in the User Accounts password area. &nbsp;Is there a character limit? It restarted and pointed out lower and upper cases (the caps lock key question). &nbsp;Usually numbers are allowed? &nbsp;Now, special characters may throw it off, and I wasn't sure which special
 characters, if any, were allowed and might be typed. Anyway, if all regular characters on a typical, standard American keyboard are suitable for passwords, and it did not give an error, then I can only conclude that either deep-rooted malware was on the machine
 or I made a mistake in typing the password twice, like mistyping the intended password the same way twice. &nbsp;(I tried a couple of different combinations too, like just in case I accidentally missed hitting a shift key at the time I missed the character.) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There were several other permissions I did create such as networking channels (shortcuts) to the printer, and I remember having an ASP.net account which I disabled for quite some time, but I also noticed a guest user account, an account or permissions for creator
 owner, regular administrator, my user account name and computer numbers, etc., and I am not aware of nor do I recall any administrator by the name of John?<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I know not to try system restore or a disk-check with bad viruses or malware because they can spread or spill over bad partitions and corrupt the rest of the hard-drive; possibly what corrupted my first hard-drive.<br />
<br />
I have not tried last known good configuration, would that work and be a good thing or not?<br />
<br />
I also have system state back up, but a few days old, and possibly have encryption key(s), and password or close deviation of it.<br />
<br />
Will I lose my files, settings, programs or hard drive if I reset my password?<br />
<br />
What are all the alternatives or procedures? &nbsp;Is it possible for me to brute force crack it?<br />
<br />
This mission cannot fail. &nbsp;If absolutely necessary, I can escalate the procedures. &nbsp;Then it may be necessary to take more drastic measures. &nbsp;I understand everything cannot always be saved; it would be foolish to think otherwise, but I cannot afford to lose
 much more.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?

            <p>First, although Microsoft hosts these forums, the people who respond are almost never Microsoft employees.&nbsp; Most of the responders -- particularly the most knowledgeable ones -- are volunteers who use Microsoft products, just like you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, too often, requests for help don't include enough information; your question goes to the other extreme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can understand your overly-long question, you are having difficulty logging on to a computer with XP Home Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said that you had set a password "<span>for an administrator account"</span> -- is the name of this account "Administrator" or is it an account that YOU created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were working with the built-in account named "Administrator" and changed the password for that account, Microsoft's policy (remember, it hosts these forums) forbid us from providing you with instructions to reset that password -- although doing so
 is certainly possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the password issue and your conspiracy theories in the third paragraph of your question, what do you have in mind by "<span> work my way back through the router, modem, network, etc."?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the last character of your license key is not proof of anything.&nbsp; Do
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span></strong>, however, under any circumstances post your full product key here.

            Hello Lemp, and thank you for reading or even skimming and your patience.<br />
<br />
Also, I was not exactly sure about these forums, the users, volunteers, the community, etc.; this was my first post.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the information overload, just a bit worried I guess.<br />
<br />
(Arguably, there is not proof, but I suppose some things are more certain then others.)<br />
<br />
(Most of the people here we know and trust, and we are far away from a large number of people, but people come and people go,and I read these wireless routers can be hacked from up to a one mile radius!)<br />

Correct, I am having difficulty logging onto a computer.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Windows XP has a built-in account named Administrator.&nbsp; When you first set up a Windows computer, the "best practice" is to create one or more user accounts, which can be either "computer administrator" accounts or "limited user" accounts.&nbsp; As soon as you
 create an account (and I don't remember if this happens with any account or if you have to create a "computer administrator" account), the built-in account named Administrator is hidden from view.&nbsp; The reason for this is to keep an account with administrator
 privileges for emergency use -- for example, if you forget the password to your "daily use" account(s) or your "daily use" account(s) becomes corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you can't remember or don't know if the account you are trying to use is the built-in account, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the computer and repeatedly tap the F8 key, starting immediately after the Power On Self Test (POST) is completed.&nbsp; If you see the Windows logo, you waited too long to start tapping and you'll have to restart and try again.</li><li>When you get to the Advanced Boot Options menu (white text on a black screen), use the up/down arrows to select "Safe Mode" and press Enter (the mouse will not work on this screen)</li></ul>
<p>If the built-in account is still named Administrator, it will show on the Welcome screen when the computer restarts into Safe Mode.&nbsp; The default password for the built-in account is blank (no password).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see "Administrator" on the Safe Mode Welcome screen, you must have changed its name and have been using it as a daily user account.&nbsp; If you do see "Administrator" on the Safe Mode Welcome screen but a blank password doesn't work, you must have
 change the password.&nbsp; In either case, that's as far as we can go here.&nbsp; Google is your friend.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>I believe this router was never really secured by us for the network of computers here.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>Every home <strong>wireless</strong> router can and should be secured by configuring a strong encryption key using WPA2 (preferably) or WPA technology.&nbsp; The User Guide for you router will explain how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't understand what you are getting at with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>Strange permissions: &nbsp;Some of my last changes were cutting off some shared credentials since it seemed like they were from users that I didn't know ...<br />
<br />
Malware or typical behavior: I didn't think malware might be involved at first, so I was going to try a safe mode workaround I came across on the internet, but after starting it, it seemed like other stuff slowly started to come through? &nbsp;And I didn't follow
 through to change the password because I wasn't sure I could get and reset the account without losing some things like encryption keys, programs, etc. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Safe Mode shuts down: &nbsp;Safe Mode shuts down after a few minutes. &nbsp;(Is it supposed to?)<br />
<br />
Unknown user: &nbsp;If I stay at the windows screen til the screensaver turns on, it says turn off John?<br />
<br />
More processes: &nbsp;Start-ups seem to be happening slower and getting riskier, processes are showing during boot ******.sys ...</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode is not supposed to automatically shut down.&nbsp; Do you get an error message before the system shuts down? If so, what is the complete text without paraphrasing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the complete text of the message when the screensaver turns on?&nbsp; Is the message part of the screensaver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last sentence appears to indicate that you actually CAN log on to this computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you can log on, do so and open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK).</p>
<p>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; net users &gt; "%userprofile%\Desktop\info.text"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; notepad "%userprofile%\Desktop\info.text"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>Click in the open Notepad window, Select All (CTRL+A), Copy (CTRL+C), and then Paste (CTRL+V) the data into your reply here.</p>

            Don't worry, soon after, it only took a few minutes to figure out what the problem was. &nbsp;Something definitely went wrong, but I was easily able to solve the problem and get back inside.<br />
<br />
All I can say is hopefully other XP users are very careful about changing passwords, not just because of typos, but because of system failures, problems, corruption, etc. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think it was the built in Administrator account. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
As for the router problem, I found a guide, but the steps didn't work for some reason, and the admin password was already set, maybe I should figure that out too.<br />
<br />
The safe mode shutdown thing was strange, and there was no error message, just automatically shuts down, but I think it was because there is an overheat protection mechanism and one or two spikes can cross the threshold temperature, causing a shutdown. &nbsp;Still
 might be something for me to further investigate though.<br />
<br />
Irrelevant now, but at the user login screen, if I waited until the screensaver appeared, then the other name John showed at the Turn Off User button at the logon screen. &nbsp;(All you can do at that point is turn off/restart or click a user.) Hmm ...<br />
<br />
Lastly, I noticed there is a user account by the name I last used to network some shared settings, an Administrator ASPNET Guest underneath the minus signs, and a HelpAssistant Support_######## account under another name.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just glad I could get back in to recover those files. &nbsp;Thanks for your help, some of these ideas helped me find what was wrong, but not why or how it happened! &nbsp;Very unusual behaviors.<br />
<br />
Recommendation for the future is to try a simple password first to make sure it works, because if there is a mistake or wrong character, it will be easier to find!<br />
<br />
Despite its limitations, the wonders of safe mode! &nbsp;<br />

<h3> jimmhead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloaded game wont launch at all</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded Lego Marvel Superheros on xbox one, during the download it prompted me with the message that it was ready to start, about 40% downloaded. when i attempted to start the game it showed a picture of the game before returning to the xbox one home
 screen, with a message somewhere along the lines of "additional content needed", when the game was completely downloaded and installed the same thing happened when i launched except this time with no error message, just returned to the home screen.</p>
<p>I've tried restarting (cold reboot), iv'e tried re-downloading the entire game, but nothing works, it just wont launch the game.</p>

<p>Anyone else getting this issue/ know how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Why are you performing SFC scan?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify
 that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types"
 is not checked.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
