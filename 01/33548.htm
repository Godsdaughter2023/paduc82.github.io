<h2>            I wish to recombine two separate volumes or drives &#40;ie&#58; C&#38;D&#41;</h2>
                    A short while ago I split my "C" drive into a "C" and a "D" drive but left too little room in the "C" file.&nbsp; So, now I'd like to return the "D" drive back into the "C" drive.<br />
<br />
I was able to change the "D" drive into unallocated space and realize that I can change it back into another drive BUT when I tried to change it into (merge with) the C" drive the format for changing unallocated space didn't allow me to choose the C drive.
 I could choose any other letter but C.<br />
<br />
I actually reformatted my entire drive after making numerous copies of both my own personal information as well as setting up the proper discs in order to allow me to restart the computer later. WOW, what a job that was but now it's done and no matter what
 error I may make I have the right equipment to reup my computer.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, is there anyone who has info on how to accomplish the reunification of a drive?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE: to be able to transfer the entire file from the C drive to the new drive.&nbsp; Each time I try to do that all I can do is to copy from one to another. I need to FREE UP SPACE!<br />
<br />
Help. Thanks.<br />
<br />

            <p>If the unallocated space is immediately after C, right click on C in Disk Management and extend C into the free space.</p>
<p>If there is any other layout you will need a third party partition management tool. See

<h2>            Folder Properties shows 0 bytes in size, and shows it &#39;Contains 0 Files 0 Folders&#39;</h2>
                    Hello Friends,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Over the past few days I have noticed that my Folder Properties (Right Click &gt; Properties) doesn't show the 'folder size' or the 'number of files/folders' the folder contains.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the General Tab of the Folder Properties the following is displayed:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Size : 0 bytes</div>
<div>Size on disk : 0 bytes</div>
<div>Contains: 0 Files, 0 Folders</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything else works fine. This problem is specific to the folders. In case of files all details are shown as usual.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In fact when I bring my mouse over the folders the&nbsp;tool tips&nbsp;DO show the folder size and also names of files they contain.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also this is not because of the folder being empty or anything as this problem is for ALL folders invariably including the Windows folder.</div>
<div>I have tried using Command Prompt. The 'dir' command can list the folder size with no problems.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also have all requisite permissions as I am the admin. Also UAC etc. is in place.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional Details: I have no problems moving folders, copy pasting etc. whatsoever and the computer is working totally fine. Only this problem stumps me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>
                </div>

            <p>I too had this problem with a particular folder only. I found that folder name was too big and it had special character in it's name. It was ~ in my case. Check if your folder name ( all folder and file names inside the folder too). and it does not have
 unwanted special characters in it. </p>

    <title>ping problems in XP sp3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cal931  say:</h3>
<h2>            ping problems in XP sp3</h2>
                    Pinging computer's own IP address or name&nbsp; times out. Ping works on other wireless LAN's&nbsp; computers and on router.<br />
Connection Properties shows "TCP/IP", "File and Printer sharing", "NW link Net BIOS" and "Link layer Topology discovery Responder" all checked, among others.<br />
Computer cannot connect with other LAN computers but does connect to the Internet using Firefox or Mozilla; however IE 8 does not work.<br />
&nbsp;Firewall on or off makes no difference.<br />
&nbsp;ICMP table shows "Allow incoming echo request" checked. <br />
The same problems occur with a wired connection to the LAN,; seems to rule out defective adapter.
<br />
Various diagnostic or repair tools do not remedy.<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated.<br />

            When a computer can't ping itself, the problem is almost always caused by a firewall program on that computer.&nbsp; Note that some antivirus programs have a firewall function that you have to configure.<br />
<br />
Disabling a firewall program sometimes isn't enough.&nbsp; You might have to un-install a firewall program and reboot to see if it was causing the problem.<br />
<br />
"NW link Net BIOS" isn't needed and you can remove it.&nbsp; <br />

            This is very common problem just because we ignore&nbsp;few little thing.<br />
<br />
Just install <strong>IPX/XPS/Net bios</strong> strictly only for&nbsp;Network&nbsp;card&nbsp;connected to another computer(directly/indirectly).
<br />
from <strong>Network card\Properties\Install<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
And rest all<br />
Best of Luck<br />

Vote as helpful if it really does work

            Steve,<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't answer sooner; I thought I would be notified of answers but that didn't happen, I don't know why. Apologies.<br />
<br />
Disabling both Norton and Windows firewalls didn't help; I had done that earlier and did it again with no improvement.<br />
<br />
However, uninstalling Symantec's Norton Security worked. The computer now pings itself and accesses other computers in the network.<br />
<br />
Many&nbsp; thanks.<br />

IPX/XPS/NetBIOS had been installed when I asked for help. The problem was the Norton firewall; Steve diagnosed it and uninstalling it did the trick.<br />
<br />
Thanks for bothering to answer anyway.<br />

<p>I think the only way DLC could help DA2 would be if it gave us a completely new game. DAO was a masterpiece. DA2 was one of my biggest disappointments in a sequel ever. I thought the biggest trend in gaming was motion control... I was wrong. It's the dumbing

<h2>            Finger print stopped working after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have HP envy 15j,my fingerprint scanner doesn't work after I updated to windows 10. it seems that there is a problem with the driver as I can not see the driver at all. moreover, normally the scanner flashed when I start the laptop but it is not the case
 anymore. the scanner is totally dead. also, I am not able to see Windows Hello option at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download the driver from HP site with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you are facing. I will certainly help you with this.</span> This issue may arise due to driver corruption issue. Kindly follow the below given steps to
 troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run<strong> </strong>the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>
troubleshooter and check if it helps<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Type troubleshooting in the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; search bar.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</span></li><li><span>Click<strong> </strong>on<strong> Hardware and Devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; troubleshooter.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also update the fingerprint scanner driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press (Windows key + X) and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click on “Device Manager”.</span></li><li><span>Expand “Other devices”.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on the drivers and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to try installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Download the fingerprint scanner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘Properties’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>‘Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>
‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>For Windows Hello, I suggest you to refer to the below given link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-what-is-hello" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-what-is-hello</span></span></a></p>

    <title>Win 7-PC is not Accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyw1968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7-PC is not Accessible</h2>
                    I have 2 separate computers, Desktop is running&nbsp; Win 7 Professional Edition.&nbsp;&nbsp; My addition computer is a netbook (laptop) and it is running Vista Home Edition.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I log into network using the laptop I see my Desktop-PC in the workgroup along with My
 workgroup from my Laptop.&nbsp; However when I try to get access to my Desktop-PC&nbsp; I get the following&nbsp;error message
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "\\xxxxxx-PC is not accessible.&nbsp; You might not have permission to use this network resource.&nbsp; Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Logon failure:&nbsp; the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer."<br />
On the Win 7 desktop I have done&nbsp;few&nbsp;things that I have done.<br />
1.&nbsp;I have removed all the sharing files, rebooted and then reset all the sharing files&nbsp;to Allow everyone to share with a permission level of 3 from&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;people to share at a time.<br />
2.&nbsp;I can change the settings&nbsp;for file sharing when I select access without password protection, I get full access to the network sharing files, but when I request password protection I get the error.<br />
3.&nbsp; I can access to all sharing files when I am on the Desktop and accessing my laptop files.<br />
On the Laptop I can access files when password protection is turned off.&nbsp; But when it is turned on I can't access shared files on the Desktop-PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I had compete access from either computer to the other with no issues then a few weeks ago&nbsp;I noticed I no longer had access to shared printer from the Laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I have no access at all to desktop shared files.&nbsp; I don't get a pop up&nbsp;like before when I first
 setup my network shared files&nbsp; User name and Password.<br />
I also have gone in thru the Laptop&nbsp; User Accounts//Manage your network passwords//Added the&nbsp;Network password for the desktop because my Desktop-PC wasn't listed to have access.<br />
Can I please get some help, so that I can get access to my Desktop-PC from my laptop.&nbsp; I can currently get access from the Desktop to the PC, but I would like to get access from the Laptop to the Desktop.<br />
Thank You,<br />
Joey.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I've managed to solve my problem of being unable to access&nbsp;....\\DELLDESKTOP.</p>
<p>I searched the forums and found the following method which sorted my problem but apparently it only works on machines running XP Home.</p>
<p>On the machine running XP Home go to Microsoft and download the rktools program and run it</p>
<p>You find it at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4544</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, click on Start, All Programs, Windows Resource Kit Tools, Command Shell</p>
<p>Then enter the following commands (case sensitive)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>net user guest /active:yes</p>
<p>ntrights +r SeNetworkLogonRight -u Guest</p>
<p>ntrights -r SeDenyNetworkLogonRight -u Guest</p>
<p>I cannot remember who posted this solution but I found it by typing in the actual error message,&nbsp;in full, in the search box.</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This issue started last night April 1. I am getting no error messages. Before this issue I had another issue where it told me to restart the computer, which I did, then it would say to restart again. To fix this 1st problem I went into regedit and
 changed startup.exe from 1 to 3. After that issue came this current one. I have not tried troubleshooting because of the constant restarting.&nbsp;

<p>What wee you running before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Why did you choose to do a Reset in the first place?</p>
<p>To find out what you are running ...just go to 'Settings'&gt; 'Systems'&gt;..</p>
<p>And select 'About'</p>

            I chose keep existing files (which I probably shouldn't have done). Windows 10 home i believe. I free upgraded from windows 8 a while back but if you're asking what I had before the reset it was 10. I wanted to reset to have a fresh start.

            My system does not boot to sign in or lock screen. It boots to where it shows the windows install percentage then restarts over and over. I did not make a recovery stick. I'm trying to do a hard reset where I hold the power button when windows shows up
 until the pc turns off. Then I repeat this process until it takes me to the repair screen.

            <p>Hi Jesse, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In most cases, once you start to refresh or reset your PC, it’ll finish on its own. However, if Windows needs missing files, you’ll be asked to insert recovery media.
</span>This is typically located on a DVD disc or thumb drive.<span> If that happens, what you’ll need depends on your PC.</span></p>
<p>

 helps. </span></p>

                    <p>While researching errors listed in my event viewer I noticed that the system time reported is 8 (eight) hours off and after further research previous to October 31st the time differential was 7 (seven) hours. You will notice the report time of the error

<p>I want to renew my xbox account especially since its 1 month for 1$ but when I confirm my purchase I get an error saying, "Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live please try again later. Status Code: 80190821." I looked it up and people said it was processing
 error and Xbox said that my(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">VISA)</span>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DEBIT</span> CARD should have money on it (Which I have $50 on it) and have no online buying restrictions on it. (I have no restrictions on my card considering I buy books on Amazon with it.) So whats the problem then!?!
 Not only have I tried my one Debit Card, I have tried 2 more of them and I still get that same error! If anyone can help me with this problem Message me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or message my most used Gamertag AdaM30XXX your solution. OH YA could this problem be
 caused by a system update because I have seen a few posts about this problem on the forums too.</p>

<p>^ This error can actually be caused for no reason at all, your account can be clear of any outstanding balance, not locked, not suspended, not have any problems at all that would usually cause these errors.</p>
<p>Your best way around this is going to be to try to use a different payment option, or use a prepaid code instead. Because this problem usually comes from the bank as they won't authorise the payment (whether they'll admit it or not) Xbox support cannot do
 anything to recitfy it.</p>
<p>FYI this wouldn't have anything to do with the system update at all.</p>

<p>The payments actually pass through several things and if it fails or times out at any one of these it could prevent the purchase from going through. Usually its good to wait 48 hours and try again.</p>

                    <p>I am having an issue with other people using my Xbox One without permission. I have put a passkey on my account and turned on&nbsp;as many restrictions as I could but the "continue without saving" feature on games is allowing them to play games such as NHL17 without signing into an account (guest or otherwise). I am hoping to find a consol wide lock down feature where a passkey is required to start up the consol. If such thing does not exist I am looking to bring to idea to Microsofts attention.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installed, speakers not detected</h2>
                    Yesterday I used headphones with itvplayer. Today neither internal speakers nor the headphones 'exist' according to the PC. Windows 10 installed a week or so ago in place of W7, on Dell Vostro laptop. How to rediscover these elements?

            Thank you for that informative piece. However, the fault occurred in restarting after an update, and all the other ways to obtain sound failed as the laptop kept telling me that I had no speakers. I now have it all working well, simply by reinstating W7,
 and will have to avoid the W10 upgrade sneaking in.<br />

            Having re-instated W7, I am having some new issues as the reprogramming did not work out completely. I am very disappointed with both W10 and the re-instated W7, and would like to know how to prevent W10 from re-installing itself without my consent. When
 W10 is properly balanced and tested I may then install it but not before that. Not be a technical expert I do not wish to spend hours trying to resolve issues which should never have occurred in the first place. Obviously, pushing W10 before it is fully corrected
 is not good for customer relations.

            Exact same issue happened to me (12-04-2015). Upgraded fromWindows 7 with free upgrade about 1 month ago. The on 12/04 I used the headphone jacks for first time to play audio through my TV (and video from VGA output). Worked fine....video and audio played
 through TV. &nbsp;Then disconnected laptop from cables and from that point on my Dell Latitude E6420 will not play sound. It states that no audio device is found. Been trying to resolve this by updating drivers, restarting services, and searching internet for solution.
 &nbsp;If I cannot find one I will have to re-install Windows 7 and NEVER EVER go back to using Windows 10.....very frustrating. &nbsp;Anyone with similar issue and hopefully a solution, please reply.

            Hi Kevin. I am now going to try to completely remove W10 from my system, as it keeps on attempting to install itself. Just today an associate told me he had had the same issues with W10 and decided to revert to W7, however his W7 failed to install properly,
 so he now has a non-functioning PC, until he can obtain a recovery disc.<br />

            You might also want to goto the xbox 360 account protection page, and select require profile download, then follow steps on there to continue. This will remove the Xbox 360 as a trusted device, as it will need to log in using your password instead of automatically
 logging in. <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-GB/profile/protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>As long as you didn't have your account set to auto-sign in, you should be good. For peace of mind, I'd definitely suggest changing your password. This will require you to sign in with the new password on your xbox one console.</p>

            there isn't a way to erase and account remotely from a console.&nbsp; It's good that you have it password protected.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully they will just erase your account from the console since they don't have access to it.&nbsp;

<p>Just to sum up a few different posts which give important information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Xbox 360 it is NOT enough to just change your password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to go to the Profile Protection page here:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/profile/protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/profile/protection</a>&nbsp;and have your Xbox 360 request that your account requires a password
 entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way, you have remotely "disabled" your profile on your sold 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a> and change your account password.</p>
<p>Ideally, you also enable Two Step Verification further down on the page and set up a free Authenticator App on your smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With these steps, your account is now safe again (and if you enabled Two Step Verification basically hacking/theft proof).</p>

<h2>            reallocation of disk space</h2>
                    I am trying to install Windows 10 update. It gives me an error that my D recovery disk is not big enough. I do not know how to add more space to D. There is plenty of space on C. How do I move space from C drive to D drive.

            Hi Binay.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't know why but to reinstall Single Language you must go back to Version 1703 to download from  MS Techbench:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Immediately after install expedite all Windows Updates so you get Version 1803 installed with most all Updates rolled into it.  
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            Hi Binay, you won't need your Product Key, Windows 10 will automatically activate as long as you re-install Windows 10 Single Language
<br />
<br />However if you want to get that, 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />The problem is that that latest Windows 10 ISO does not contain the Single Language version
<br />
<br />If you do not have Windows 10 Installation Media:
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 Single Language 1703 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then use this utility form Microsoft to create the bootable installation Media from that ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Single Language) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />

            You would probably end with Installing Windows 10 Home and it would not activate with a Windows 10 Home SL key.

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>

<br />
<br />Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. 
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

            Hi Gary,
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan.

<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and upgrade again.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded.</p>

</p><p>7) I have not been able to reserve Windows 10 for my machine till date although I have the recent Windows updates. How can I go about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the application has a blank screen or does not work or is not available:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</strong></li><li>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser. This will happen automatically within a day or it can be run manually from an&nbsp;admin command prompt:
<ul>
<li>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once started, it may take&nbsp;10 minutes or so&nbsp;for the appraiser to complete. Once&nbsp;complete, re-open the Get Windows 10 app and it will have the updated compatibility information.</p>

</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>

</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you

<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom

</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Settings for Mouse&#47;Touchpad</h2>
                    My e-machines E527-2537 laptop has a Synaptic touchpad, which works fine in Windows 10. However,&nbsp;device settings&nbsp;insists that I have a PS2 Mouse and only provides information and options&nbsp;for the mouse I don't have. The properties window says my mouse device
 is working properly and provides all the usual hardware IDs and driver status. Windows 10 Settings wants me to ID which mouse buttons I prefer and set up the wheel ... that I don't have. There's no info/options/properties for the touchpad. I've read dozens
 of threads about touchpads that don't work or have glitches in Windows 10, but haven't seen reference to this issue. How do I correct this so that I gain access to the appropriate info/settings?

            <p><span>Hi Craig,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to completely uninstall the touchpad driver and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.</li><li>In the list of devices, you should see the touchpad drivers.</li><li>Right click on the device and then select "Uninstall".</li><li>In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</li><li>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes”
</strong>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps, let us know the status of the issue.</p>
