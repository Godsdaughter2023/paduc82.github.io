<h2>            Refund&#47;Roblox game</h2>
                    <p>This is not really a question, but if a member of the Xbox/Microsoft refund team or anyone else would like to reply to help this situation please feel free to comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My 5 year old daughter has now made four charges to my bank account without my knowledge or permission. The first three purchases she made I requested refunds for but I was unaware you could make more than one refund request on the same form, so I submitted
 one refund request and then the other two requests together. Only one refund was approved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put restrictions on my daughters account that would ask me for permission before making any more purchases, however she was able to make two more unauthorized charges on March 10. I submitted a refund request for these two new charges and my request was
 denied. I have been replying to the refund teams email from the original refund requests but after three attempts I have not heard back from anyone regarding getting my money back for these now FOUR charges. I am now tired of playing cat and mouse with the
 Microsoft team. I have already logged into my account again and made sure the content restrictions were turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by a Microsoft rep that only one refund is permitted but it was not specified how often or when a refund is permitted. Either way, I will not settle for only one of these unauthorized charges being refunded. The account I use only has money in
 it when I know a purchase will be made, therefore when my daughter made these charges there were no funds to cover them. I have already paid the bank $130 dollars for the purchases made and the fees charged by the bank, and now I am again -$128. This will
 make a total of over $250 dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am extremely frustrated with Microsoft at this point. I will continue to demand not only the refunds from 02/17/2019 but also refunds for purchases made on 03/10/2019. I have already contacted my bank to dispute all of these charges and will go as far
 as I can until this money is returned to my account and the fees my bank charged me will be overturned as well.&nbsp;</p>

            You have been thru the refund process and your daughter continues to make purchases on the account I suggest you change the account password and do not leave yourself signed in.&nbsp; Disputing the charges is likely your best bet and you may want to remove
 any payment method or set up two factor authentication.

            Saturday, April 20, 2019, I got charged 13 times ($84.87) in one day. I called Microsoft on the April 22, 2019. Not exactly word, basically it's my fault they only can give $49.92 back.&nbsp; Before I can even finish the conversation, they hang-up. I didn't
 even get a real confirmation whether or not I will get the money back. Microsoft has been charging since Feb. of this year 2019 for a total of 105.84. I am a mom of 4, school teacher with NO MONEY. Microsoft is a billion dollar company and stealing from poor
 school teacher like me.&nbsp; I called back with a&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed - Personal Information)</strong> I was told an email with a case number was sent to me which was a LIE. #<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Bill Gates @</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Bill

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS M1330 Laptop with Microsoft Windows Vista Business 32-Bit Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says "Checking For Updates" and will not go farther.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell said to just re-install Vista, which I did, twice, from Recovery Drive D, and I ran Standalone SP1 and SP2 to get as far along as I could, knowing that there are numerous additional Updates needed since SP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried System File Checker, the Intel Matrix Storage Hard Drive Software R200174.exe, version A04, which is the Rapid Storage Technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Repair BITS Service Repair Tool says the BITS Service does not need repairing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows FixIt will not run, it gets hung at installing tool updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update Standalone Installer gets hung at checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the Microsoft manual Fix It Myself Steps using the Command Prompt - Run As Administrator, and the following failed :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not Valid Names were:</p>
<p>
</p><p>appidsvc.dll</p>

</p><p>The others in the steps all seemed to load, but, it did nothing to make Windows Update begin to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many of the comments and suggestions, and nothing has changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am asking for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe updating to Windows 7 would not be a good idea on this laptop, per the Windows 7 Upgrade Adviser, though I really like Windows 7, and I liked Vista O.K. until this Windows Update Issue cropped up.</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>Windows Update will not work...It says "<strong>Checking For Updates</strong>" and will not go farther.
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi Diamondspearls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the initial "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" phase of Windows Update (WU) seems to hang for hours without throwing an error message, many Win 7 and Vista users have been having the same issue dating back to the official release of Win 10 in July 2015.&nbsp;
 See the posts in my thread <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/august-2015-windows-update-for-vista-requires-one/1016829d-50d2-4a2b-91bc-5e1591f47c1b?page=2">
<em>August 2015 Windows Update for Vista Requires One Hour to Run to Completion</em></a> since 16-May-2016 for a summary of what I've found so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reliable workaround I've heard of (other than letting WU run for several hours to find monthly Patch Tuesday updates) is posted on Dalai's webpage titled&nbsp;
<em><strong><a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Search for Windows Updates takes forever? - A possible solution</a></strong></em> .&nbsp; This webpage currently has a list of five Windows kernel-mode driver (<strong>Win32k.sys</strong>)
 updates that must be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center and pre-installed before you run Windows Update if any of those five updates are&nbsp; missing from your system.&nbsp; From the author of that webpage:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>This HowTo is valid for Win7 SP1 and Vista SP2, which have been newly installed or haven't been updated for some time. It should also help on systems that were up-to-date last month -<strong> just install the missing updates from the list below in this
 case</strong>...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>...The term "solution" might be a little bit exaggerated, since the following HowTo only tries to make sure that the Update Agent doesn't need to check all updates, so the check for new updates is done faster. Futhermore, it's only a temporary solution;
 most likely the issue will appear again with the next Patchday</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying this workaround, check your <strong>Windows Update Agent</strong> (WUA) at C:\Windows\system32\<strong>wuaueng.dll</strong> and confirm you have the current
<strong>v7.6.7600.256</strong> (rel. June 2012) for 32-bit Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have an older version of the WUA see the section titled
<em>Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP</em> in the support article KB949104:
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to update the Windows Update Agent to the latest version</a></em>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've just performed a re-install with the standalone Vista SP2 installer, you'll likely find that all five of the required Win32k.sys updates on Dalai's webpage are missing from your list of installed updates at Windows Update |
<strong>View installed updates</strong> and will have to be installed manually (from oldest to newest). &nbsp; The approximate release dates of these updates are: KB3078601 (18-Aug-2015); KB3087039 (08-Sep-2015); KB3109094 (07-Dec-2015); KB3145739 (12-Apr-2016);
 KB3153199 (10-May-2016).&nbsp; Since you have a 32-bit Vista OS you would <strong>use the download links for Vi</strong><strong>sta (x86).&nbsp;</strong> Then re-boot and run a manual WU and let "<em>Checking for updates..</em>." run until it reports that updates are
 available for download.&nbsp; This should take about 20 min to 1 hour, depending on the number of available updates WU finds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users who managed to install their April 2016 Patch Tuesday updates last month should only have to pre-install one missing update from the Microsoft Download Center -
<strong>KB3153199</strong> - before running WU to apply their May 2016 Patch Tuesday updates.<br />

            <p>great White,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for this reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try these things Tomorrow and Saturday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on the computer since 7:30 a.m. today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I posed my question, I restarted in Safe Mode With Networking, and Windows Update would not even launch at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, prior to creating this question, I have worked for months to try getting Windows Update to work, leaving it on for days at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, again, I had BIG Trouble getting SP 1 and SP2 to work after re-installing Vista, both times, and the SP's were standalones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched and stumbled into so many things that I probably have forgotten about many that I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am hopeful that something you have provided will get things going in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to post what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi Diamondspearls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be some other underlying problem with your Windows Update components, so post back if you confirm you have the latest
<strong>Windows Update Agent </strong><strong>v7.6.7600.256 </strong>(WUA) for Vista and still have difficulty installing any of the standalone installers (.msu files) for the Win32k.sys updates mentioned in my previous post.</p>
<br />
<p>If you haven't already done so, I'd also advise that you <strong>disable automatic Windows Updates</strong> [Start | Control Panel | Windows Update | Change settings | Important updates | Never check for updates (not recommended)] and re-start your computer.
 This will not prevent your Windows Update service wuauserv from loading at boot-up but it will prevent Windows Update from automatically launching in the background and consuming high amounts of memory and CPU while you're trying to diagnose your problem.</p>

</p><p>I had made sure of it a long while back, and should have stated so in&nbsp; my original post, but, as I was saying, I have been going up and down, and all around, in order to find resolution for this nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may end up having to retire this laptop, even though I like it, (and, of course, I paid a ton for it originally, not that it would worth much now!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows 7 Upgrade Adviser (Advisor?) many times, too, and there were a few shortcomings I was concerned about if I was to upgrade, and&nbsp; I really like Windows 7,&nbsp;so it would be nice to use, maybe if I cannot overcome this Vista Windows Update
 debacle,&nbsp;I might risk it and install Windows 7 and see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I had turned Windows Update to Not Check At All For Updates, already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am trying to run the KB3078601 Update, and it is just the same Standalone Windows Updater, saying it is checking for updates, but getting nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not&nbsp;do things properly to add the script to the Folder that I have these 5 Updates in on a flash drive per Dalai's instruction, because, when I Double-Click the Script File, it just opens the Notepad Text Information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I don't know how to do that, apparently, and I am also murky on the instructions he provides above it regarding using a Command Line Shell As Administrator to try to run the updates one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done that type thing before, I guess, and I am thinking he makes a step or two of expecting that folks know each thing automatically, but I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is probably something I should know, I guess, but I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I just clicked the first Update to open it and run it, and got the searching for updates in the Standalone Windows Update Window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no more steps to try right now, and hope you will be able to guide me further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think as I have gotten older, I have realized there are lots of little things to still learn to complete tasks in the world of computers, even though I have quite a bit of experience, I have continued to learn more and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You again for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Hi Diamondspearls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, you noted in your original post that you re-installed Vista from your
<strong>recovery drive</strong>, but after reading <a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/dell-recovery-partition/#Access_the_recovery_partition_in_Windows_Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Dell </em><em>Recovery Partition – Guide for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8</em></a> I'm not sure if you tried to repair your Windows installation or if you completely restored your laptop back to its factory settings. Since you had to reinstall the SP1 and SP2
 service packs I assume you <strong>restored all the way back to your factory image</strong>.&nbsp; If that's correct, then you likely
<strong>re-installed outdated software</strong> that was installed at the factory (e.g., possibly an old 30-day trial version of antivirus software like Norton or McAfee) and
<strong>rolled back drivers for hardware components</strong> like your network and video cards.&nbsp; Are you having any other noticeable problems on your computer other than Windows Updates, and if so have you updated your Dell XPS M1330 with the latest available
 software and drivers at <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-m1330/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-m1330/drivers</a>?&nbsp; There is also a

http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-m1330/diagnose</a> to check your laptop components but I'm not sure if this tool will run if the warranty for your laptop has expired.<br />
<br />
<strong>If your only concern right now is installing the five missing Win32k.sys updates on Dalai's webpage</strong>, just try the oldest KB3078601 released 18-Aug-2015 as follows - assuming this KB isn't already in your list of installed Windows updates at

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Dalai's webpage at <a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi, Great White North,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to wait to submit any further update information regarding my progress, because I am right in the middle of 228 Updates Installing, and I did not want to prematurely tell things until they were actually completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, since you detailed the above steps, I thought had better submit new information now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually stopped Windows Update in Services and it timed out before stopping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I did it again, and it would only go far enough to say Stopping, and it stayed at that status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed Services and re-booted, and went to the earliest Update, KB3078601, and it opened fine, updated, with a window that looks like the updates installing window on XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-booted, and did the KB3087039 the same way, re-booted, and so on through all Five Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Fifth Update, I went to Windows Updates Settings and changed back to Notify me, but let me decide to download and what to install, and then looked at Services - Windows Update, which was already Started, because I left it on Automatic (Delayed)
 instead of changing it to Manual, (I just forgot to change to Manual originally).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I performed Windows Update as I regularly would, double-clicking it from my Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It ran quickly, identifying 230 Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked Download and Install, and it downloaded 1,004 MB in 25 minutes, a world record, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it is installing approximately #85 of 228 Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will, of course, re-boot, then run Windows Update again until I get all of the Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, until next month's glitches hit, it will be as good as it can be, given the monstrosity caused by Microsoft pushing Windows 10, just like what happened back at the advent and populating of Windows 7 that wreaked havoc on XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hopeful it will be good for the time period before next month, and we will probably need to go into more specifics for resolution at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to respond to your first thoughts in your latest Reply, I Recovered back to Factory from the D;\Recovery Drive, and immediately installed all Dell Drivers and Downloads, and put on my usual Zonealarm, Malwarebytes, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like McAfee, and never have, and I have read too many bad things about it, like hogging memory, taking what should be free resources and tying them up even after it has completed scans and treatment, so I removed that right away, from Programs and
 Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for years my WiFi Catcher conflicted endlessly with whatever associated with encryption and who knows what, and my Intel WiFi Card was up and down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-installing Vista and Drivers has corrected ALL of that, and it is quite a relief not having to monkey with resetting things repeatedly, only to have them fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever corruption there was, and it was significant, the careful re-installations I have done has really helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most significant thing now, if the Windows Updating works properly, as it should, is that Internet Explorer Suddenly Stops Working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on Vista, IE 9 on the Dell XPS M1330 Computer, as well as&nbsp;Four computers I have with Windows 7, and the latest Dell XPS15 with Windows 10, all of which have the latest updates and latest IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get it resolved, at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Diamondspearls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's great news - it sounds like you're making good progress.&nbsp; What you've described sounds almost identical to copiman's experience in the VistaForums thread
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/windows-updates/304544-current-tips-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Current tips on updates</em></a> after he performed a clean re-install of Vista.&nbsp; Windows Update wouldn't run after he installed the SP2 service pack, but as soon as he installed the five Win32k.sys updates suggested by Dalai his "<em>Checking for updates...</em>"
 completed in 20 min and <strong>230 available updates</strong> were downloaded and installed within about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I suspect this pre-install of missing Win32k.sys updates is only a <strong>temporary solution</strong> and that these slow Windows Updates will return next month after a new batch of Patch Tuesday updates is released.&nbsp; Going forward, I suggest that you leave
 automatic Windows Updates completely disabled [Windows Update | Change settings | Important updates |
<strong>Never check for updates (not recommended)</strong>] and check Dalai's webpage
<em><a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Search for Windows Updates takes forever? - A possible solution</strong></a></em> a few days after the June 2016 Patch Tuesday updates are posted the Microsoft update servers on
<strong>14-Jun-2016</strong> (i.e. the 2nd Tuesday of the month).&nbsp; If a new Win32k.sys update has been added to Dalai's list of recommended updates, that new update will have to be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center and pre-installed before you run
 a manual Windows Update to apply the remaining dozen or so available June 2016 updates.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest leaving your Windows Update service (wuauserv) set to <strong>Automatic (Delayed)</strong> startup so it always starts at boot-up.&nbsp; Black Viper has posted possible tweaks for Vista SP2 services &lt;<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-vista-service-pack-2-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&gt;
 and even his most severe "bare bones" configuration suggests that the BITS and Windows Update services should always be left as Automatic (Delayed).&nbsp; You won't see wuauserv consume large amounts of CPU and RAM until a Windows Update session (automatic or manual)
 is launched and the <strong>Windows Update Agent</strong> wuaueng.dll starts searching for available updates - see my comments in post # 162 of the VistaForums thread
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/windows-updates/303992-windows-update-just-seems-hang-while-checking-post1406980.html#post1406980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>windows update just seems to hang while checking</em></a>.&nbsp; These days it's very rare for Microsoft to release updates for Vista outside of Patch Tuesdays so I completely disabled my automatic Windows Updates a few years ago and just run one manual Windows
 Update each month a few days after the Patch Tuesday updates are posted to the Microsoft servers.<br />
<br />
I use Firefox as my default browser so I won't be much help with your IE browser problem, but if you're having issues on multiple machines with different OSs and different versions of IE that sounds like a problem with your Internet connection dropping out.&nbsp;
 Have you tried <strong>rebooting (power cycling) your router</strong> by unplugging the power connector, waiting for about 30 seconds and then plugging it back in?</p>

            <p>Hi, Mr. Great White North,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got 47, or so, more updates, which took a somewhat normal amount of time to install, but they downloaded VERY quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it seems good until the next Patch Cycle in June, as you said, and I will proceed accordingly, per your guidance, which I really appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have regularly re-started the ATT U-Verse Residential Gateway Modem, along with having to have that replaced too many times since I started with them in 2008, along with many, many Tech visits and Technical Assistance Repair Calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe their service is a cause of many problems, and the forums confirm my experiences with lots of other folks, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think people are very upset with their Cable and Internet Service Providers, no matter who they use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, again, very much for your help!!</p>

 the export but it is always the same result.&nbsp; Here is a screen shot of what I see after exporting the video. The result is the same when I play the video in another software.

<h2>            Gears of War 1, 2 and 3 Storyline - My Theory</h2>
                    
<p><span>First the grand theory. Man is all powerful he builds cities controls the world and imulsion. Man fights himself primarily over imulsion. Man however gets sick if he
 gets too close to imulsion (Or irradiated whatever you want to call it). Man creates race of super imulsion miners that are more resistant, AKA the locust. Locust build cities underground and happily mine imulsion. Locust keep digging further down. Locust
 that have gone the furthest down become warped (AKA Lambent) maybe they discover some other power deep in the center of the earth. Lambent locust turn on the normal locust and say "*** you guys we are taking over". Normal locust say "*** you humanity we aint
 dieing down here for you, we're coming up to the surface to take over and drown the lambent". Lucust come up during E-Day kick humanities @@@.
</span></p>




<p><span>Now to support my theory. First things first the games have made many hints that it's all about imulsion, this was hinted in gears 1 then it took a huge step forward in gears 2 when the collectable messages
 emphasized how important imulsion was, how the prices were raised during the war and one even hinted of a conspiracy theory for it (Kind of like our own world and oil). Also it was also pretty clear that the locust were man made, again this was reinforced
 with the lab level that was mysteriously "Declassified" and it's also pretty clear that Marcus's father was probably on the project as quoted by the locust queen saying "It's a shame you didn't follow in your fathers footsteps" and at the end of the credits
 he's alive and says "What have you done!" after you destroy the normal locust cities.</span></p>


<p><span><span>The last bit comes from a leaked script for the gears of war movie. It existed on the internet for a brief time about a year and a half
 ago and really explained a lot about what happened just before and during E-Day (It was a really good script and some scenes will be incredibly powerful if done right). Marcus's father was in the movie script and just before E-Day he was getting strange activities
 from the underground areas. One of the scenes had him trying to go underground to get some more data and talk to key people but the security guard was giving him a tough time saying "No one is allowed underground! Ever" which seemed kind of odd but why wouldn't
 you want people to see what was going on underground? If you created a race of supper miner slaves! That's why! Eventually the military called for Marcus's fathers help and started showing him videos of strange things that were happening underground because
 he was an expert in that area. Most likely because he was on the project and it would also make sense as to why he had all the locust tunnels mapped out in his home computers as per gears of war 1. Also it is my thought that the Queen Myrah was also a part
 of this project as in Gears 2 one of the collectables states a women named Ruth (Myrah's real name) was being experemented on in the classified facility and i beleive that she escaped to the locust hollow and then somehow became Queen and for what the humans
 did to her gained control over the locusts letting them beleive she wanted to help them when really all she wanted was revenge upon humanity which is quite obvious as you can see the attitude she displays to all humans.</span></span></p>


<p><span>Gears of War 1 beigns...</span></p>

<p><span><span>The game’s plot begins fourteen years after Emergence Day. Marcus Fenix, a former COG soldier, is reinstated into the military after spending
 four years in prison for abandoning his military post in order to make a vain attempt to save his father, Adam Fenix. Dominic Santiago successfully extracts Fenix from the prison, and takes him to meet Delta Squad. The group seeks to obtain the "resonator",
 a device that will map "The Hollow", the underground caverns which the Locust inhabit and later deploy the "Lightmass Bomb", which will destroy the heart of the Locust forces. Fenix and his allies recover the device, but suffer multiple casualties in the process.
 Amidst the chaos, Fenix leads the remaining soldiers through the ruins of Sera, to a mining facility, and finally into the planet’s depths.</span>
<span>Delta Squad successfully denotes the resonator, but the device fails to map entire tunnel network. Fortunately, they discover a larger map of the network that originates from Fenix’s old home, specifically his father’s laboratory.
<span>Delta Squad successfully denotes the resonator, but the device fails to map entire tunnel network. Fortunately, they discover a larger map of the network that originates from Fenix’s old home, specifically his father’s laboratory.
 The group ventures to the Fenix estate at East Barricade Academy, where Fenix originally attempted to rescue his father. When they arrive, Delta encounters heavy Locust resistance. After collecting the data, the group fights their way past Locust forces and
 boards a train carrying the Lightmass Bomb. Fenix and Santiago battle their way through the train, and defeat
<span>General RAAM</span>, before finally uploading the data. Fully activated, the Lightmass Bomb launches into the Hollow, and eradicates the Locust tunnel networks. In the game's final sequence, Hoffman delivers a victory speech as the
<span>General RAAM</span>, before finally uploading the data. Fully activated, the Lightmass Bomb launches into the Hollow, and eradicates the Locust tunnel networks. In the game's final sequence, Hoffman delivers a victory speech as the
 tunnels collapse and explode, whereupon the voice of the <span>
Locust Queen</span> promises that the Locust will keep on fighting, and will not stop.</span></span></p>







<p><span>Gears of War 2 begins...</span></p>


<p><span>Taking place six months after Lightmass bombing at the end of the first game, the Locust Horde has survived and has renewed their war on Humanity, and through unknown
 means begun to sink entire Human cities. With the COG army continuing to lose large numbers to Locust raids, the COG plan a counter-attack against the Locust by sending troops in Grindlifts deep below the surface to attack the home of the Locust, the Hollow.
 Sending a large **** force through the mountains to the settlement of Landown, the COG take heavy losses from Locust opposition but make it to their destination. As they prepare to use the lifts to enter the Hollow they are driven back by a counter attack
 led by the Locust armies' new leader <span>Skorge</span>. Undeterred, the human forces continue their plan. After their descent, Delta squad, consisting of
<span>Marcus Fenix</span>, <span>Dom Santiago</span> and
<span>Marcus Fenix</span>, <span>Dom Santiago</span> and
<span>Benjamin Carmine</span>, continues to search the Hollow and discovers that the Locust are using a giant Riftworm to sink the human occupied cities. as they watch it sink Liima City, they also realize that the Locust plan to have

 it eat away at the rock structures at the outskirts of Jacinto in hopes of sinking it into the ground.</span></p>


<p><span>Exploring the sink hole, Delta Squad is ambushed by Locust and rescued by
<span>Augustus Cole</span>. As they search for <span>
<span>Augustus Cole</span>. As they search for <span>
Damon Baird</span> the squad discovers that the Locust have begun taking prisoners and taking them deeper into the hollow, with unknown intentions, after a quick search they find and free Baird. Boarding the Locust prison barges, Delta Squad finds another imprisoned
 squad member, <span>Tai Kaliso</span>, who has suffered wounds inflicted by Locust torture. Though Marcus tries to arm Tai for a fight, Tai instead commits suicide, the physical and emotional trauma was too much for him to bear. As the
 squad tries to be extracted by a King Raven Gunship, they are swallowed by the Riftworm. Inside the squad quickly plans to escape, but a plan by Marcus sets the squad to destroy the worm's heart to kill it. Inside, Carmine is mauled and eaten alive by monstrous
 parasites, having been separated from the rest of Delta. After destroying the worm's heart, the squad is irritatedto discover that the worm is survived by not just one heart but three—they nonetheless locate and destroy the remaining two, effectively killing
 the worm.</span></p>


<p><span>Delta squad narrowly escapes being drowned in the creature's blood by cutting their way out to the surface only to be given orders by Hoffman to investigate a nearby
 abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. The team fights its way to the caverns in a Centaur tank and discovers that some Stranded have
 taken shelter near the entrance. Marcus orders Cole and Baird to evacuate the Stranded while he and Dom search further. They find more prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria must be inside one of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment
 has left her too traumatized and unable to communicate, so Dom reluctantly chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dominic then disguise themselves as Theron Guards and continue their infiltration of Nexus, the Locust capital, where, they encounter and free a
 captive Franklin Tsoko, and later use Jack (the squad's utility robot) to signal for COG forces from the surface, who quickly join them, including Cole and Baird.</span></p>


<p><span>Inside Delta squad discovers that the Locust are locked in a civil war between the normal Locust and the "<span>lambent</span>," who have been
 exposed to Imulsion, and seek to over throw the queen, explaining the Locust's desperation to get to the surface to escape the overwhelming Lambent. Inside the Locust palace they discover that the Locust have messages from Adam Fenix, Marcus' father, that
 suggests an alternate way of ending the war, in case they can't take out the queen; to sink Jacinto in order to let sea water flood the Hollow and wipe out the Locust. They learn from the Locust queen herself that she is pursuing the same plan not only to
 wipe out the humans, but to also destroy lambent. After a face to face meeting with the queen, and a face off against Skorge, the queen escapes on a Reaver. Marcus realizes that humans must sink Jacinto first, before the Locust mobilize and escape to the surface.</span></p>


<div><span>Delta squad escapes the Hollow on a pair of Reavers, defeating Skorge and his Hydra, and then return to Jacinto where a mass evacuation is underway.
 The COG have decided that they can sink Jacinto using a Lightmass bomb and Delta squad is ordered to clear debris out of the way in the main sink hole, allowing a helicopter to safely transport the bomb into the caverns. Marcus orders Cole and Baird to assist
 with the bomb, while he and Dom manage to kill a Brumak driver, hijack the Brumak, and use it to arrive at the Hollow and fulfill their objective. As the helicopters arrive, the Brumak, exposed to high levels of Imulsion, begins to mutate. As it changes, it
 attacks the helicopter transporting the bomb, which falls into the Imulsion. With the Lightmass bomb lost, Marcus comes up with a plan that includes killing the lambent Brumak, as lambent explode upon death, as a replacement for the bomb. He uses the Hammer
 of Dawn to kill the Brumak, which explodes, taking out the last supporting structures of Jacinto, flooding the Hollow with water. As the COG forces and civilians evacuate, a
<span>voiceover</span> of the Locust queen talks about unintended legacies. After the credits, a last voice over of Adam Fenix is heard, a radio transmission of a call for help, and a cry of desperation, revealing he is still alive.</span></div>

<p>Gears of War 3 begins...</p>
<p>Taking place two years since Jacinto was flooded, the human survivors have moved to the island of Vectes to rebuild. After a generally quiet period, the Imulsion infected Lambent began to emerge from underground. Hiding something, the COG head of state,
 Chairman Prescott, abandoned the COG eighteen months prior. Now leaderless and being forced off the island, the COG disbands and separates to the safest places left. Victor Hoffman takes some survivors to Anvil Gate while Delta squad sets off on a Raven's
 Nest Class carrier, the CNV Sovereign, with the remaining humans to avoid further Lambent incursion.</p>
<p>While Augustus Cole and his squad look for supplies from the ruins of his hometown, Chairman Prescott arrives on the Sovereign, providing Marcus with a data disc that shows his father, the scientist Adam Fenix, is still alive. The ship is soon attacked by
 a Lambent Leviathan; Marcus and his team try to defend the ship, luring the creature into a trap set by Baird at a nearby bridge. Though the Leviathan is destroyed, the ship is also lost. After Marcus, Dom, Cole, Baird, Carmine and Sam reunite, Anya contacts
 Marcus saying that Jace is with her and that Prescott is wounded. They make it to Prescott, who is mortally wounded from the destruction of the ship. Prescott discloses Adam's location to Marcus, Azura, and then dies of his wounds. Leaving some of his Gears
 to help the survivors, Marcus, Cole, Dom, and Baird take off towards Anvil Base, where they have the equipment to decode the key, while Anya and the rest care for wounded.</p>
<p>The Gears are forced to travel across Locust-controlled bases, and the Locust Queen, Myrrah, alerts all her troops in their path to the team approach. Marcus and his team eventually hijack a Locust gas barge to travel by air, stopping to help and rescue
 Dizzy, a skilled mechanic and driver. They arrive at Anvil Gate and help Hoffman defend against a Locust onslaught. Afterwards, they review the encrypted key to find the location of Azura but discover it is protected by a man-made Maelstrom, an artificial
 hurricane preventing arrival by air or on sea. Hoffman notes the location of a submarine in the ruins of Char, a nearby city, but they will need fuel. Dom suggests traveling to Mercy, where an Imulsion filling station is located — coincidentally, also the
 home of his dead wife Maria.</p>
<p>At Mercy, the Gears discover humans that have become Lambent from Imulsion poisoning, and fear the infection may spread. As they are surrounded by Lambent forces, Dom finds a truck and drives it through a tunnel and back into the tanker, which kills Dom
 and all hostile forces. The squad is able to escape but lose their fuel in the process of Dom's death. Turning to Char, they come across Stranded, led by Griffin, who have come to despise the COG due to Char being one of the first chosen cities in the Hammer
 of Dawn counter-strikes. Griffin holds Dizzy hostage to force the Gears to return a supply of Imulsion from a nearby building; when they return, Myrrah and the Locust have attacked the tower. The Gears escape with Dizzy, while Griffin vows to get revenge for
 the deaths of the Stranded. Eventually, the team makes their way to the naval base, where the submarine is located. After repairing and refuelling it, they set off for Azura.</p>
<p>After slipping under the Maelstrom, they find Azura is fashioned as a large resort. As they fight off the Locust that are also trying to get to Adam, the team deduce that Prescott had knowledge that Emergence Day was coming, as he had ordered the construction
 of Azura and brought the world's elite to it prior to the appearance of the Locust. Adam is able to contact the team via the security cameras on the island, and explains he has a cure to stop the Lambent but needs the Gears help to execute it. Marcus and his
 team fight through the Locust to shut down the Maelstrom generator with Adam's instructions, allowing Baird, Cole and Carmine to arrive together with the remnants of the COG and UIR to provide air and ground support. Baird and Cole reunite with Delta and Baird
 asks about Dom and Dizzy. Marcus says Dizzy's taking the submarine offshore and that Dom didn't make it. As Lambent forces start appearing on the island, the Gears make their way to a hotel where Adam is being kept. En route, they face Myrrah, who reveals
 that Adam had been working with her for twenty years and refuses to let them help him complete his plan. After dispatching Myrrah, the squad reaches Adam's room. After a brief reunion and hearing news about the death of Dom, Adam explains that Imulsion is
 a parasite, adapting itself to both Locust and human bodies to create the Lambent, and it is evolving quickly, threatening to destroy Sera. Adam has developed an energy wave that, like a neutron bomb, will only destroy cells infected by Imulsion. Though this
 will kill the Lambent, it will also kill the Locust troops; Adam had been in contact with Myrrah to try to stave off the effects on the Locust and to discover a cure that would not harm them, but could not find it in time.</p>
<p>Marcus and his squad escort Adam to the roof of the hotel where the energy generator for his cure sits, which he powers up. The team defends against Myrrah's attack. Carmine, fighting Myrrah from a Raven, is shot down off the tower, presumably killing him.
 Adam gives the Hammer of Dawn to the squad and the squad uses the Hammer on Myrrah, causing her to crash. Before the machine reaches full power, Baird asks how Adam tested the machine and he revels he tested it on himself because he injected himself with Imulsion
 to find out how it reproduced. As Adam begins to turn lambent, He tells Marcus he was glad to see him again and to go live his life for him. Adam then dies due to the Imulsion, turning him into ashes. Myrrah, still alive from the last attack, explains Adam's
 plans and blames Marcus for what Adam failed to do. Enraged, Marcus kills Myrrah by stabing her in the chest with Dom's knife. As Marcus stares at Myrrah's blood on the knife, the machine reaches its final stage which sends an energy pulse sweeping throughout
 Sera, wiping out both the locust and lambent, ending the war.</p>
<p>The scene changes to show a COG's helmet on the ground, where it is subsequently picked up and put on by Carmine — showing that he survived the attack. The Gears celebrate the Locust's defeat while Marcus mourns Dom and Adam. Anya reminds Marcus that because
 of Adam, they have a tomorrow. She then takes his hand, puts her head on his shoulder, and with the other Gears looking onward, they all stare into the horizon.</p>

<p>I know, it's hard to put everything in perspective but i'm looking at it more so now that the writer just went through adding things that they wanted to along the way and never really put much consideration into the reasons behind everything. Hene the reason
 why Cliffy B says they arn't going to answer every question because it seems with a lot of stuff they dont really know the answers themselves.</p>

<p>True, but the COGs in the dlc should have retro lancers and the cities should not be getting hit by the Hammers of Dawn yet either. Plus why do they have so many Silverbacks early on and none later until 3? Why are their locust shooting out of the ground&nbsp;like
 in 3 intead of&nbsp;emergence holes?&nbsp;Many plot holes in a 2-3 hour dlc campaign.</p>

<p>While there are some holes in the DLC. </p>
<p>1. The COG may have had the normal lancer (with chainsaw) by the time of the DLC. In the book Cole Train is issued one which he is using on guard duty before the hammer strikes take place
</p>
<p>2. As for the ahmmer strikes on the cities, that could simply be the cog figuring if they did not use them they would loose the battle. Not like they just blasting the city, they are tring to pin point the targets.</p>
<p>3. The locust come out of holes as well as shot from the gorund. Maybe the locust have two methods (1. a hole for a big rush of locut to run through, 2. many single holes for a surprise attack)</p>
<p>4. Delta team may not have been near to many silverbacks until part 3. By the time part 3 begins the cog (what was left of it) lived on a single island. This means all the resources the cog had (coudl move) where there to. Till then the cog still was spread
 out and Delta being a front line unit probably did not want to travel with a big (heavy) slow moving walker, nor would the government want to risk such a platform by placing it with a unit that more than likely would need to leave it behind.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts but like IceGrip96 said, it would be impossible to answer every little detail</p>

<p>1) The DLC is based right after E-Day and the chainsaw lancer was not invented until years later after they found out the retro lancer would not pierce the skins of locust without running ahead of time. So it still would figure that Z Squad would not be
 outfitted with chainsaw lancers and locust would not have them as well. </p>
<p>2) I will let that one slide I guess</p>
<p>3) No, it clearly stats why they do it in 3 so for them to do it in this DLC does not fit</p>
<p>4) yet they just happen to randomly have two aboard their old makeshift boat in 3?
</p>
<p>Just admit the dlc has many issues and let it go.</p>

<p>1. The dlc takes place some time after e-day. If it didn't how would they know the names of things already or even know what to expect, not like this takes place the day the grubs first show up? Cole enlist after the locust come up, he is issued a chain
 saw lancer, thus it is possible they where around at the time of the DLC</p>
<p>3. I will have to look into this opne a bit more myself but sure it can be explained.</p>
<p>4. That make shift boat is what is left ogf the cog navy. As I said, by the time Gears three happens most of the cogs resources are in one place. You do not see silverbacks in 1 or 2 becouse where would they be used? I doubt Delta would be off hunting for
 Alpha in silverbacks (gears 1), and I doubt the cog would want to send what ever ones they have left into the hollow in part 2. The silverbacks appear to be more defensive than offensive and as high speed (moble) unit delta would not use such a thing.</p>

<p>I'm no expert and this is just my opinion. &nbsp;But I think your video card could be faulty. &nbsp;If this doesn't happen in any other game then I do find that odd because I haven't had this happen (thankfully) when I played Dead Rising. &nbsp;Test out a few other games,
 if you can. &nbsp;If you don't own any other games just download a demo of NBA Live 14 and test it out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have tried other games and have not had this issue. Other people on the forums have said some of the same things. I'm gonna call Microsoft, because no one has answers on here. I don't want a faulty device.

<p>G'day all! If this is only happening with one game, then let's try the following steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall the game from your console by highlighting the game tile and pressing the Menu button on the controller.
</li><li>Power cycle: Hold the console's power button for 5-10 seconds to shut it off. Let it sit for a full 30 seconds, then restart.
</li><li>Re-install the game, and launch it to play. </li></ul>
<p><br />
If you're still experiencing the visual distortions after that, then it may be best to consider a repair.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I did as Misses Joust suggested but the severe pixelation continues. I had two DR3 disks (day one version &amp; regular). AC-BF works fine. Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>UPDATE - STILL NOT RESOLVED - I have a day one Xbox one and bundled it with Assassins Creed Black Flag &amp; Deadrising 3. AC plays wonderfully. DR3 on the other hand has large black pixelated blobs that move across the screen. I uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared
 out the cache, I even returned the disk and got another but still have the same problem. I then got Forza and it is also pixelated (not as badly as DR3). I've tried calibrating my TV (Sharp Aquos 70") but still the only games that plays well is AC BF. I got
 a hold of Microsoft and they said if one game in four works they it's the games not the Xbox one. Hummmmm. Just wondering if anyone else has had these issues or can suggest some kind of fix.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>

<p>I also have the same problem. Bought an Xbox One for Christmas for my boys and Dead Rising 3 for myself. I had the previously described pixelation and flashing orbs problem.</p>
<p>I brought the game back yesterday and exchanged it. I also uninstalled it from the Xbox, then re-installed it with the new disc. The same problem occurred after installation.</p>
<p>I would seem to be the game since the other games work just fine..</p>
<p>However, this seems to be rare among owners of this game and the people who are having this problem have tried multiple discs... I can't imagine all of us having bad enough luck where we get two bad discs.</p>
<p>If there is an issue with some of these machines and this game exposes it, please let us know.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback Koition. I've searched all kinds of forums for help but everyone tells me it's just bad luck or to buy a new TV. I picked up a third copy of DR3 today and alas, same issue. I did notice the black 'blobs' appear where the lighting
 is very bright (ie, shining through the windows just after the opening cinematic. I have a 70" Sharp Aquos Quattron that's just a year old. It was professionally configured so i don't want to mess with the settings too much. Especially since the first game
 I tried (Assassins Creed) worked very well and there is plenty of brightly lit scenes in it. I'm taking the console back and getting a new one. I really do think it's a defect and perhaps Microsoft just isn't aware of it yet. Cheers. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> watervav  say:</h3>
<h2>            How I &#91;SOLVED&#93; my issue of &#34;Xbox 360 wired controller shows up as &#39;Unknown device&#39; in Device manager, and has no drivers installed&#34; &#91;GUIDE&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! 3 Months ago i posted about an issue with my Xbox 360 wired controller, I have solved it since then, Why i am even writing about it now is because the user Teresa194 asked me how i solved it, And because the thread locked and because i can't get privat
 messaging to work im just gonna make a guide here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Symptom</strong>: Xbox controller does not show up in "Device manager" and lights only light up the light #1 and #4 OR Xbox controller shows up as "Unkown device" with no drivers installed in "Device manager" but controller has no lights turned on.</p>
<p>in either symptom its the same problem with the same solution.</p>
<p>I had to troubleshoot with my controller for a few days untill i noticed that, For whatever reason, the controller only shows up in "Device manager" as "Unkown device" if i plug it into my 3.0 USB ports (Doesn't even make sense, I know.)</p>
<p>So try your USB 3.0 ports, if it doenst work (only lighting up the lights #1 and #4) leave it plugged in for a while and then unplug, replug in the same port again.</p>
<p>Just to verify that its the same problem that i had^</p>
<p>If it doesnt work still on the USB 3.0 ports then that means you need to update them, Thats what i had to do</p>
<p>Go to "Device manager" and find your USB 3.0 ports there. Looks like this:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2f2MI7Y2C.png" /></p>
<p>Now you need to figure out your USB 3.0 ports Software-ID You do that by right-clicking on the USB 3.0 ports in Device manager and selecting "Properties" go to "Information" and in the drop down box select "Software-ID" It will look like this:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fqMBayxU.png" /></p>
<p>also take a look at what verision your drivers are in the "Driver" tab, Becaues you'll want to update them so make sure you dont just install the same verision.</p>
<p>so now we're going into terriroty where im still not very infromed, But as an example, The important values on my USB 3.0 Software-ID is "VEN/VID: 1B6F, DEV/PID: 7023"</p>
<p>There are several sites that archive these drivers and such, but you'll have to google your values (Or use Duckduckgo, its a bit better for finding these kinds of things)</p>
<p>with these values you'll determine the exackt modell of your USB 3.0 (i think) i found this site:
<a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/1b6f/7023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/1b6f/7023</a></p>
<p>so see, Now i know its a EJ168 USB 3.0 Host Controller. (its easy to get the wrong information online, So i'd recommend using this
<a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pci-ids.ucw.cz</a> website)</p>
<p>So now its easy, Just google / duckduckgo your device like "EJ168 USB 3.0 Host controller drivers" and i found this for me
<a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/en/products/u3hc.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.etron.com.tw/en/products/u3hc.php</a></p>
<p>altho the driver download on that site didnt work for me for some reason so i kinda had to&nbsp;*Removed* the URL (just re-wrote the URL :P) to this " :
<a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/php/products/SETUP_0.119.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.etron.com.tw/php/products/SETUP_0.119.zip</a> "</p>
<p>I unzipped that file, Ran the installer but still my controller didnt want to work so here is the absolute most crazy part that solved my problem:</p>
<p>You know that part of the controller cable where you can seperate the USB end from the cable? This thingy:
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fiuY3DVH.jpg" /><br />
Seperate it and while still having the USB end (the thing form the picture) plugged into your computer, Very slowly connect the two parts again, Like really slowly, and after i did that, The Xbox drivers installed themselves automatically (they didnt do that
 before)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BTW</strong>: After doing this, The xbox 360 controller will <strong>only
</strong>work on your USB 3.0 ports (the blue USB ports)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very annoying, Very random issue that took me 5 days + a load of help from some more IT-experienced friends, Hope this was helpful to Teresa194 or someone, ever.</p>
<p>Goodbye!</p>

            Hi Tom
<br />
<br />If you disable that in Device Manager, Windows should not reload it, if you uninstall it then Windows will automatically load that on every reboot
<br />
<br />Ideally if you boot into BIOS and disable that drive form there, if that options is available to you in BIOS, that would solve this for you
<br />
<br />When you boot up your PC, usually on the manufacturers logo you either repeatedly press F2 or F10 to enter BIOS . . .

            If you really want to disable it, are you able to get into the device and just unplug it? 
<br />
<br />If not, try this: 
<br />
<br />First disable it in device manager again like i assume you have been doing. This is done by pressing win + X &gt; Device manager &gt; expand DVD/CD-ROM node &gt; open properties &gt; Disable
<br />
<br />Create a restore point for your PC before continuing. Do not continue until you do this. You can do this by typing "create a restore point" in windows search then clicking "create a restore point" &gt; create 
<br />
<br />Go back to windows search and type "cmd" and right click "command prompt" &gt; run as administrator. Type/copy and paste this command: 
<br />
<br />reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\cdrom /t REG_DWORD /v "Start" /d 4 /f
<br />
<br />This should disable the drive. 
<br />
<br />Re-enable with: 
<br />
<br />reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\cdrom /t REG_DWORD /v "Start" /d 1 /f
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps

<h2>            HOW TO RESTORE HP PAVILION DV7 NOTEBOOK BACK TO THE FACTORY IMAGE&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>My HP PAVILION DV7 NOTEBOOK I believe came installed originally with Vista, which I then upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate and now Windows 8.1 PRO. &nbsp;Can someone please tell me, step by step, how to reset the notebook back to its factory image?
 I tried using the DVD ROM that came with it, but it didn't work. Windows 8.1 recovery options keep asking to insert the media device, but it recognizes the DVD rom drive. Still nothing. I can't perform any of the recovery options available for Windows 8.1.
 &nbsp;The notebook basically works, but I can't remove iCloud, iTunes, I can't install Office 365, and I tried using other programs to remove them, but absolutely nothing works. The C drive is partitioned into two, one of them being the recovery drive. Since I
 have never done this before, how do I reset the notebook using the recovery partition? If anyone has anyone as on just how to refresh it or reset it without going back to the factory image, I'd welcome that advice as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

            Thanks for replying, I fixed it a couple of weeks ago. What I did was go to Device Manager and checked every single component to make sure that it was up to date. Then I went to troubleshooting on System and Security and troubleshooted everything and found
 out that the blue screening came from a major driver carried over from 8.1 that was conflicting with W10, so after running the troubleshooter, that fixed the blue screening, but it still had a problem where if it was left idling for 15-20 minutes, it would
 completely lock up and the only way to fix it would be to force the computer to shut down by holding down the power button, very bad for the HDD. So I did a Google search and discovered that other people were having the same problem, and that on some drivers
 listed under Device Manager, there is a tab labeled Power Management that has a setting where the computer can shut down that particular component if it's not being used for a certain amount of time, so after unchecking that option on e

</p><p>Auto Arrange isn't on. &nbsp;Show Desktop Icons is checked. &nbsp;The exception is the Recycle Bin. &nbsp;It is always on the top left. &nbsp;The Recycle Bin box is checked (Desktop right click, Personalize, Change Desktop Icons). &nbsp;I assume this is why it never changes. &nbsp;I
 tried deleting my IconCache from my AppData\Local Folder and restarting but it didn't work.</p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank yo for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description desktop icons disappear from your screen and gets back after restating the computer. There might be a chance that there is some third part conflict or your system is affected by some virus/malware. There might be a chance that
 there is some system file corruption which is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that this computer is connected in work environment. If you have the administrator permission then you may try the steps provided below and if not you might need to contact your IT department team.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists and you are able to login to your computer then I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run

</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong><span><br />
If still issue persists I would suggest you to run the <strong>Microsoft safety scanner.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Use my Windows user account&#34; wireless sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have imaged a Dell Latitude E7480 with a corporate image of Windows 10 Fall Creator's Edition (1709) and I have it joined to our domain. Usually, when our users connect to the wireless there is a checkbox that says "use my windows user account" that they
 can check off and it will fill in the current user credentials of that person and sign them into the Corporate wireless. On the current imaged machines that box is grayed out, any suggestions as to how to get that box "ungrayed"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Arlene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your phone usually has a software that it needs to import files onto your computer. How are you transferring your files? I recommend checking out your device manufacturer's website if there is a software that you need to use when transferring files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>My software is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I had my previous iphone I had no issues transfering files. I got a newer version iphone and a new laptop with windows 10 and the laptop seems as if its not recognizing all my photos. It only recognizes 10.</p>
