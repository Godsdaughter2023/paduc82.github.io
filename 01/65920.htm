<h2>            Audio out of sync with my TiVo Premire</h2>
                    I have a tivo premire and I run the tivo thru the pass thru and then to the tv, and I got audio lag for live tv and recorded shows as well. So far it's intermittent.

<p>Hi, LexLuthor1980,</p>
<p>How often is this happening, and is it drifting over time on its own or have you isolated any specific conditions that cause this to happen? Is this recoverable if you quit and restart the Live TV app (which you can do by using the menu button when you have
 Live TV selected in the main tile on the home screen and choosing Quit)?</p>

<p>It happens all the time, I will be watching espn and it's fine. Then I change the channel and the audio is like 3 seconds off. I watch a recorded show on my tivo and the audio is off. I've tried changing the settings on the Xbox to energy conserve, or surround
 sound beta, and then I'll plug in my sound bar and the audio will be only 1 second off. I'm at a loss as to why it happens. But I'd say it's out of sync 75% of the time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried what you said, and It didn't work. I've tried shutting down everything and restarting. Nothing. &nbsp;I have a sound bar hooked up to the optical audio, and that doesn't match with video, or the sound coming out of tv either.

<p>Any news on this issue?</p>

<p>I have a TiVo Premier and mine runs fine, the only "issue" I have is that I do not have the options to record or watch recorded shows through the Oneguide. I have to grab my TiVo remote and go through the normal menu to do that.
</p>
<p>All I can really do Is just pause and RR/FW live TV</p>

<p>There are typically delay/audio sync settings for hdmi on receivers and soundbars and I suspect this is your problem. Try looking though your component manuals to see if you can adjust this.</p>

<p>Open&nbsp; <strong>Run</strong> command box by pressing Windows key+R, type&nbsp; services.msc and press&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Enter</strong> . Locate&nbsp; <strong>DHCP Client</strong> &nbsp; and check if it is enabled or disabled. If disabled then enable it and see whether the problem still remains or not.<br />
<br />
Open&nbsp; <strong>Run</strong> command box by pressing Windows key+R, type&nbsp; <strong>cmd</strong> and press&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Enter</strong> . In the command prompt, type&nbsp; <strong>ipconfig/all</strong> and press&nbsp; Enter. Now check the IP address, default gateway, DNS etc. If you find all the information are correct but you still can't access the Internet then whether the wireless
 network you are connecting is secured or not. To determine look at the Wireless network icon in the taskbar and click on it. It will show the available wireless networks. If there is a "yellow shield" present on the network icon then the network is not secured,
 if there's no "yellow shield" present then the network is secure. In a secure network you might need a "Network Security Key". In that case try to disable the "Network Security Key" option for that network. To do this:</p>
<p>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> , click&nbsp; <strong>Network and Internet</strong> , click&nbsp;
<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> , click<strong>&nbsp; Manage wireless networks</strong> from left.</p>
<p>From the list select the wireless network and right-click, select&nbsp; <strong>Properties,&nbsp;</strong> on the&nbsp;
<strong>Security</strong> tab disable all options i.e., in <strong>Security type</strong> select&nbsp;
<strong>No authentication (Open)</strong> and in&nbsp; <strong>Encryption type</strong> select<strong>&nbsp; None</strong> . You may also enable the automatic connectivity and SSID settings for further strengthening the connectivity, in the connection tab click to select
 the "<strong>Connect automatically when this network is in range</strong> " and "<strong>Connect even if the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID)</strong> check-boxes.</p>
<p>For more information click here and see how you can determine whether a network is secure or not.</p>

<p>If the problem still remains then check your firewall settings and make sure that the firewall isn't blocking your Internet connectivity. Some Antivirus software has built-in firewall and they by default blocks any connection unknown for tightening security.</p>
<p>Try to restore default settings for the Windows Firewall. Open&nbsp; <strong>Control Panel&nbsp;
</strong>click&nbsp; <strong>Network and Internet </strong>click&nbsp; <strong>System and Security</strong> , click&nbsp;
<strong>Windows Firewall</strong> , click&nbsp; <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> .</p>
<p>Hope this will help. Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hello, I recently purchased a new mic. The sound itself works perfectly. But the mic does not work, I did go to recording devices and enabled show disabled
 devices, I see "Microphone" but when I click enable nothing happens, it stays disabled. I have realtek HD Audio Manager and I am not sure if it picks up my mic. I tired 3 different ports. Keyboard, front panel and back panel. Nothing works. I tried with a
 different mic and still the same error. The mic does not use its own drivers, it uses Windows drivers such as the Realtek HD audio manager.</span><br />

<p><span><span>Hi Adam,
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here’s a good place for you to start, please refer to this article on how to
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Set up a Windows Media Center Extender device</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/8076aff3-16ec-4751-9f57-d36e0ff407201033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/8076aff3-16ec-4751-9f57-d36e0ff407201033.mspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Set up a Windows Media Center Extender device
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You will be able to connect certain consumer electronic devices to your home network, so that the device can be used as a Windows Media Center
 Extender. For example, some networked TVs or DVD players will be available to use as a Windows Media Center Extender. These types of Extender devices will be available in the future. Many devices that have Extender functionality will come with a remote control
 that has a Windows Media Center Green Start button<span>&nbsp; </span>. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You will be able to enjoy digital media content that is stored on your Windows Media Center computer from anywhere in your home by using the
 Extender after it is connected to your home network.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Turn on your Windows Media Center computer and log onto Windows. Verify that your computer is connected to your home network.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Turn on your Extender and verify that it is connected to your home network.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Press the Green Start button<span>&nbsp; </span>that appears on your Extender remote control or on the front panel of the Extender device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow the instructions that appear on the TV or monitor for your Extender to obtain an 8-digit Windows Media Center Setup Key. Write down this 8-digit setup key. This is the key that you will use to affiliate your Extender with your computer that has
 Windows Media Center.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Windows Media Center, on the start screen, scroll to Tasks, and then click add extender.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the Welcome to Windows Media Center Extender Setup screen in Windows Media Center, click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Windows Media Center, on the Enter the Setup Key screen, use the Windows Media Center remote control or keyboard to enter the 8-digit setup key that you wrote down, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow the steps in Extender Setup.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Several changes are automatically made to your Windows Media Center computer during the Extender Setup, including changes to the Windows Firewall.
 For more information about Windows Firewall, see Windows Firewall: recommended links. During this time, the Windows Media Center Extender service (which is named mcx2svc) starts on your computer, along with other dependent services.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have a firewall running on your computer that is not the Windows Firewall, make sure that the firewall software is set up to allow Xbox
 360 to connect to your Windows Media Center computer as a Windows Media Center Extender. Some firewalls are already set up to allow Xbox 360 to connect to a Windows Media Center computer as a Media Center Extender. However, other firewalls will require you
 to make changes to how the firewall software is set up. For more information about which firewalls are already set up to allow a Media Center Extender connection, as well as information about how to set up other firewalls to work with a Windows Media Center

    <title>MAC address spontaneously changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inflatablemouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            MAC address spontaneously changing</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox has wifi disabled and is wired.</p>

<p>I've been logging DHCP requests with MAC addresses and at one point I logged:</p>
<p>xbox - 4c:0b:be:ab:18:d4</p>
<p>Today I logged:</p>
<p>? -&nbsp;4c:0b:be:ab:18:d4</p>
<p>While at the same time this appeared:</p>
<p>xbox -&nbsp;4c:0b:be:ab:18:d8</p>

<p>How can this happen? Why is the xbox' MAC address changing? This should never happen and a MAC address is (should) be hardcoded in the hardware NIC. I know it can be software overridden sometimes but this should definitely not happen automatically and it
 can cause serious issues.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>InflatableMouse,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Looking up those MAC addresses they're both registered to Microsoft, meaning they're both Xbox MAC addresses. As the address is physically tied to the network card be it Wireless or Ethernet it cannot change. As such I would imagine that you're viewing your
 wireless and ethernet card MAC. Perhaps on a boot up the wireless quickly connected and dropped off. Unless you have 2 Xbox's in the house, those are your Wireless and Ethernet MACs. It's not possible to be anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WIN10 does not utilize full 16GB of RAM, 8GB hardware reserved</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have been reading previous posts on this subject but have yet to find a resolution to this issue. So far I have: Verified
 all 16GB are recognized in BIOS, BIOS is up to date. This is a new build. System specs shows 16GB physical RAM installed, but only 7.95 are "useable." I ran the memory diagnostic tool (mdsched) and no errors were reported. I verified via msconfig that the
 "max memory" box was NOT checked. Memory is installed in slots 1 and 3.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Hardware/Software:</span><br />

 32-bit OS but I have 64-bit WIN10 so this is quite puzzling. No one I have contacted seems to have a solution or specific explanation. MSI concluded that it is a Windows related issue. I would appreciate an explanation of the issue, maybe it is normal?</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/724ffc99-36e2-427e-a004-dd5658db56a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/724ffc99-36e2-427e-a004-dd5658db56a6" /></a></p>

</p><p>It's already set to 1600mhz, I did that right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question still goes unanswered (unresolved), many ideas and opinions yet no change at all. I have posted the question in MS Support, Tom's Hardware, Kingston Memory, and MSI Support. I am stunned that no one can resolve this, it clearly is not just me experiencing
 this. I can't think of anything else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've tested the memory it is good.</p>
<p>Yes, the bios is up to date.</p>
<p>Yes, I checked msconfig and "max memory box" is not checked.</p>
<p>Memtest finds no errors.</p>
<p>I experience no errors in games or regular use at all, just the odd fact that WIN10 does not seem to utilize all 16GB of RAM. "Hardware reserved." I speculated at the beginning that perhaps this is normal and the extra RAM gets tapped into when needed. Yet,
 no one can confirm this. Very odd to me here in the heart of Microsoft support I can get no answer.</p>
<p>The only thing I have NOT done is put the RAM into slots 1&amp;2 because that makes no sense-1&amp;3 are the recommended slots.</p>

<p><em>"I am stunned that no one can resolve this... it clearly is not just me experiencing this..."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If only PC problems had a one size fits all solution more than a small percentage of the time.</p>
<p>You are not the only one, but would be in a minority of total Windows users, and this is not a Win10</p>
<p>exclusive issue. However, you should be seeing 15.9 GB, or close to that, as usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Very odd to me here in the heart of Microsoft support I can get no answer."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Many</em> questions go unanswered ( including many that get mysteriously marked as an answer ).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I experience no errors in games"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean games don't lag or otherwise run poorly, you wouldn't. Even 8GB is more than any
</p>
<p>game (including Windows and a few background programs)&nbsp; will use @ 1080p (a few games are getting</p>
<p>very close to topping 8GB with all max settings though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't know if Windows will report both sticks, and the full 16GB if a RAM slot is faulty, but it may be
</p>
<p>worth trying a single stick in slots one and three to verify.</p>
<p>btw- They most likely change the setup with different series MoBo's, but MSI suggest slots 2&amp;4 for my board.</p>
<p>Handy if using a large cpu cooler, but both sticks still get recognised, and all 16GB is available, if using 1&amp;3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- No answers in the following either, but...</p>
<p>Even though the highest non-overclocked RAM speed for this model cpu and motherboard is 1866MHz ,
</p>
<p>I would be inclined to leave the RAM settings at the motherboard default (which looks to be 1600MHz on</p>
<p>this model)&nbsp; Default is always going to be the most stable option. </p>
<p>All BIOS settings should be at default while troubleshooting cpu, MoBo, RAM issues (with the obvious exceptions such as the Logo screen, etc.) .</p>
<p>- Note too that numerous tests have shown that there is only a 1-2% increase in system performance between</p>
<p>1600 - 2000 MHz, so if the MoBo <em>does</em> default to 1333 MHz you will never see the difference.</p>
<p>I believe dual vs single channel would have a bigger performance impact than raw RAM speed if using RAM</p>
<p>intensive programs. Games in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm a bit surprised that MSI (or was it an MSI community member ? ) would suggest increasing the
</p>
<p>Page File size. The Page File should not be disabled, as is often suggested in this era of heaps of RAM, but</p>
<p>I've had no issues using a 2GB min and max for the past five years or so.</p>
<p>The Page File does not really add to system memory, and is not setup in the RAM.</p>
<p>It's more an HDD cache. A pre-RAM,&nbsp; pre-load area that was more important in the old days of low RAM</p>
<p>capacity. It used to also help lessen HDD thrashing when a lot of reading is required, as when loading areas</p>
<p>in games. The PS is also used for crash dumps.<br />
</p>
<p>- The Memory Tab in Task Manager &gt; Performance, better shows how the RAM&nbsp; is being allocated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Did MSI produce Win10 chipset drivers for this motherboard ? If not, the generic AMD driver</p>
<p><em>may</em> be better than the one Win10 installs ? </p>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.driversinstaller.com/amd.html?gclid=CPu3pLuNwdECFYaYvAodnsgPSg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.driversinstaller.com/amd.html?gclid=CPu3pLuNwdECFYaYvAodnsgPSg</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has been playing down the need for Win10 specific drivers from the mfg of the hardware, but</p>
<p>somehow I don't trust MS on this. I wouldn't personally risk running Win10 on a gaming machine that does</p>
<p>not have proper drivers.&nbsp; It's a Murphy's Law thing, and gaming has enough issues without adding</p>
<p>more potential for glitches.</p>

<p>Hi RickT</p>
<p>I thought your max mem suggestion might be the magic bullet, but sadly it made no difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fresh build of my "dream machine." It runs just fine and dandy, I guess I'm being **** about it but I understand WIN 10 64-bit can handle over 100GB RAM installs (not that you'd need it!) but the point is if the RAM is recognized by the OS why
 isn't it utilized?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discussed it with my son the future bachelor of applied science major..(cheers son!) and we both agree that when it says "useable" that equals "available" meaning the other 8.05GB of RAM are being utilized by the OS, where needed. The other 7.95GB of RAM
 are in reserve more or less. I don't know if this is correct, but would love an actual Microsoft engineer to chime in and confirm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers all!</p>

<p>You are not the only one, but would be in a minority of total Windows users, and this is not a Win10</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>"I experience no errors in games"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean games don't lag or otherwise run poorly, you wouldn't. Even 8GB is more than any
</p>
<p>game (including Windows and a few background programs)&nbsp; will use @ 1080p (a few games are getting</p>
<p>very close to topping 8GB with all max settings though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw- The very likely change the setup with different series MoBo's, but MSI suggest slots 2&amp;4 for myboard. Handy if using a large cpu cooler, but both sticks still get recognised if using 1&amp;3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- No answers in the following, but...</p>
<p>Even though the highest non-overclocked RAM speed for this model cpu and motherboard is 1866MHz ,
</p>
<p>I would be inclined to leave the RAM settings at the motherboard default (which looks to be 1600MHz on</p>
<p>this motherboard)&nbsp; Default is always going to be the most stable option. </p>
<p>All BIOS settings should be at default while troubleshooting cpu, MoBo, RAM issues (with the obvious exceptions such as the Logo screen, etc.) .</p>
<p>- Note too that numerous tests have shown that there is only a 1-2% increase in system performance between</p>
<p>1600 - 2000 MHz, so if the MoBo <em>does</em> default to 1333 MHz you will never see the difference.</p>
<p>I believe dual vs single channel would have a bigger performance impact than raw RAM speed if using RAM</p>
<p>intensive programs. Games in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm a bit surprised that MSI (or was it an MSI community member ? ) would suggest increasing the
</p>
<p>Page File size. The Page File should not be disabled, as is often suggested in this era of heaps of RAM, but</p>
<p>I've had no issues using a 2GB min and max for the past five years or so.</p>
<p>The Page File does not really add to system memory, and is not setup in the RAM.</p>
<p>It's more an HDD cache. A pre-RAM,&nbsp; pre-load area that was more important in the old days of low RAM</p>
<p>capacity. It used to also help lessen HDD thrashing when a lot of reading is required, as when loading areas</p>
<p>in games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Memory Tab in Task Manager &gt; Performance, better shows how the RAM&nbsp; is being allocated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Did MSI produce Win10 chipset drivers for this motherboard ? If not, the generic AMD driver</p>
<p><em>may</em> be better than the one Win10 installs ? </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. Very insightful comments/questions. I suppose this is POSSIBLE this a MSI MB issue, but I doubt it. This 990FXA is a fairly recent offering, the bios update is old, 12/24/15 but still I don't think that is the issue but I could be wrong.
 I say again, I have not tried using different slots but if you think that might make a difference I'm willing to try, just tired of pulling open the case when it's working so well ya know? I'm using the Wraith CPU cooler BTW. Here is the reading from task
 manager:</p>

<h3> kdsavvy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music Keeps Stopping and Starting on a Windows 7 Laptop</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 Home Premium laptop and when I play music in either iTunes or Windows Media Player it will continue to play songs but keeps stopping and starting again almost like the computer is freezing and unfreezing.&nbsp; It normally starts after the
 songs have been playing for about 10 minutes and there is no pattern as to when it stops in the song or how long it stops for or which song it's playing.<br />
<br />
I have talked to iTunes and I've even had my computer in to be looked at and no one seems to know how to fix it.&nbsp; Is it possible there is a drive that's been installed incorrectly? Does anyone know what I can do to fix this? I've tried a clean boot and that
 doesn't work either.<br />

<h2>            stereo mix is available, but no sound in Windows 8</h2>
                    I have a Stereo-Mix problem with a new Windows 8 HP desktop computer. &nbsp;The Stereo Mix is set as default in the Recording window of the SOUND management system. &nbsp;When I play something on the computer (such as a wave file) there is no indication the sound
 is being passed through to the Stereo Mix device. &nbsp;In my old HP with Win 7 the stereo mix would show sound being played in the computer and I could record it. &nbsp;Now I can not record it because the stereo mix is not seeing the sound on my Win 8 machine. &nbsp;My

            No, I don't have any Realtek devices on my computer; but my problem has been resolved.&nbsp; Suggestions were made to go through all Manage Audio Devices and reduce volumes of unused devices.&nbsp; I adjusted all the volumes in the Windows sound device window (under
 recording), the Beats Audio window; turned down unused volumes for Playback devices and checked my recording software - Audition.&nbsp; It seems to work pretty good now.&nbsp; Thanks.

</p><p>Thank you very much for your question regarding iHeartRadio and Twitter on the Surface RT! I'm sorry that it closes and goes back to start screen when it's opened. I'd love to help resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify, are you using the iHeartRadio and Twitter app or are you accessing the websites on IE?</li><li>If you're using the app version of iHeartRadio and Twitter, you can uninstall them by:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Go to start screen (not desktop)</li><li>Hold down the app icon</li><li>The menu bar should pop up at the bottom of the screen; choose Uninstall</li><li>Re-install the apps again from the Store</li></ol>
<p>Let me know if the issue was resolved after uninstalling and re-installing the apps!</p>

<h2>            RDP is too slow to use with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I use RDP to connect from my desk top to old notebook running Windows 7 professional. &nbsp;It works great and I have no complaints. &nbsp;Now, I purchased a new laptop which is much more powerful (Lenovo P51
 with Xeon processor, 64GB ECC memory, 2TB m.2 ssd drive) with Windows 10 professional on it. When I connect from the same desktop machine to the new laptop in the same network, the RDB become too slow to be useful. It takes significant lag for my type to show
 up. &nbsp;Bloomberg business unit sync is sensitive to the connection speed. &nbsp;I can remote to my old notebook, run bloomberg terminal on the old notebook, and sync my BUnit on my desktop windows without any problem. However, the same thing does not work with my
 new much more powerful notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, when I first started the remote connection, it works fine. &nbsp;Only after 10 minutes or so, the problem shows up and it become sluggish and it starts to take time for my keystroke to show up.
 &nbsp; This is repeatable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RDP client on my desktop and RDP server on my notebook is connected&nbsp; directly through &nbsp;linksys LGS308 8-port gigabit smart switch.&nbsp; The connection method is identical as I did for my old notebook
 and RDP works fine with my old notebook. Therefore,&nbsp; network connection is not an issue.

<h2>            The internet connection is lost in Windows 10</h2>
                    I shutdown every night. &nbsp;In the morning, I start Windows 10 and it makes no internet connection. &nbsp;I restart Windows 10 and the internet connection works - at least for a while. &nbsp;I often lose the connection randomly throughout the day and the only solution
 that I have found is to restart. &nbsp;Not a good solution.

Thanks a lot Mogojohn! This problem has driven me nearly off the cliff! It appears that your solution was the answer. Incredible to me that Microsoft would consider a real power saver like turning off the Network Adapter. TYPICAL of the Powers that be in today's
 world.

            <p>This solution is a workaround because the real issue is the network drivers which should be able to cope with Windows turning off power during inactivity and/or Sleep/Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you ever get a driver update for your network adaptor, try turning on this option again and see if all is well</p>

<h2>            Razer onza cannot connect to windows</h2>
                    I just bought a brand new razer onza, tried connecting it to my PC running windows 7 home premium 64-bit and it didn't work
<div>I expected it to be plug and play since a CD was not included in the box.</div>
<div>The auto install icon would appear, but then it would say installation failed, could not find driver.</div>
<div>I go to device manager and it says driver not installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I took a look at the manual that came with the box, which states different from the razer website, the website says is plug and play, but the manual says download a driver from microsoft, the driver for xbox360 controllers. I downloaded that driver,
 still nothing, only got a few blue screens, I had to restore my PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help please?</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the article for (code 28) in device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in. If you are asked for the driver
 and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.<br />
<br />
In the device Properties dialog box, click the <strong><span>Driver</span></strong> tab, and then click
<strong><span>Update Driver</span></strong> to start the
<strong><span>Hardware Update Wizard</span></strong>. Follow the instructions to install the driver.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to update the drivers from the manufacture of the product and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong><span><br />

    <title>RDP Will no longer login to Windows 7 VM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob arone  say:</h3>
<h2>            RDP Will no longer login to Windows 7 VM</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 7 VM running an old application, because the application will not run on Windows 10. I have been RDP into it for months, and now it is giving me this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your password may have expired or the remote PC might not accept blank passwords"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my environment:</p>
<p>Windows 2008r2 DC</p>
<p>Windows 7 &amp; 10 Pro PC's</p>
<p>VM is on Win10 Pro PC, Workgroup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, worked a month ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to RDP from Win7 Pro PC and received the same message. But the old RDP gives you more information, and I saw that I was trying to login with a domain user, instead of a local user. Changed the login to login as a local user and it connected right
 away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to change the login on the Win10 PC to a local login and it still gives me the same error. Is the format of local login (Machinename\Username) different on the new RDP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;at install any app</h2>
                    I did 2 things. Ran wsrestore. Which restored the Store. Uninstalled KB82887595 as advised by Wotan(?) and others. Did not improve installation problem with store. I am unable to get anything from the store. I also have 8.1 problems other than store. Printer
 won't work. (Going to call Dell) and Scan Snap won't work (working on that). Everything was better with just Windows 8.0 and I' mad that 8.1 cannot be uninstalled. Any advice? Any news from Microsoft about fixes?

            <p>Error Message - 0x8007064a&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Earlier the News app (which I loved) crashed and I uninstalled it. Today I tried to install the 'free' CNet. It went so far as to ask me for pay info for future installations. I chose to delay this option. Then it appeared
 to start downloading but stopped saying: "There was a problem with installation" or something like that and gave the above error message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The time is correct on my computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't check right now re: proxy servers but being a retired person not attached to any servers except the Cox.net IP ones I don't think that I have that problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Additional info: last night I wanted to 'refresh' back to hopefully what would be a date before installing 8.1 but the computer said there was a problem with this. So I 'restored' back to before 11/15/2013 which was the only 'restore' date available. I had
 already deleted the update KB 2887595 following the advice of several forum members. This did not seem to help anything. I had run wsrestore (or whatever) and that DID restore the Store but not the ability to download apps. BUT there were some other KBs dated
 11/15 which did not return after I 'restored'.</p>

            <p>1. No proxy server</p>
<p>2. I do use Norton Security. I turned it off (15 minute window) and this had no effect on Store issues.</p>
<p>3. I have worse problems than the Store. I can probably by apps elsewhere. BUT I have no working printer, scanner, or 3rd party backup (Carbonite). All of this has died since 8.1 installation.</p>

<h2>            Printing support &#40;USB 3.0 not compatible&#41;</h2>
                    Hey,<br />
<br />
The problem of the day is: my Xerox Phaser 3122 does not work with Win8 (or so I think). There are no drivers and none are being planned so i pretty much gave up on the whole deal.<br />
Now as a last resort I just&nbsp;troubleshooted&nbsp;and used compatibility mode on every .exe I could find that is related and got a message saying: " USB printing support is an older USB device and might not work with USB 3.0", "Try plugging it in to a USB 2.0 port.
 Then, click Next.". (no kidding it really does not work).<br />
So here is the genuine question: is there a way to update or install a&nbsp;newer&nbsp;"printing support" version so it would be compatible with 3.0, or maybe there is a way so somehow adapt a 3.0 into 2.0 (sorry don't understand much in headers and ports...).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
David.

<h2>            BitLocker Encryption Process hangs, cannot unlock external drive</h2>
                    Hello everyone, I have windows 7 ultimate installed in my Acer Aspire 4710 laptop. I used Bitlocker Drive Encryption to start encrypting my 500 GB external Seagate hd. As you might be knowing, this particular Acer laptop has the problem of " White Screen
 of Death". Google it........you will know what a headache this problem is! (I set the HD to automatically unlock on my PC.So, when I insert it "resume" encryption window automatically comes up.) Anyway, because of this I had to pull out the USB cable without
 pausing the encryption process. After this whenever I insert the HD into my PC :- no "resume" window comes up, the drive name has changed to Local Disk (M:) (earlier it was Pandora's Box), BitLocker status is locked Control Panel "Bitlocker Drive Encryption"

            Hi Robert, thanks for taking the time to reply!
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I got the matter resolved to some extent. I created a guest account, opened an elevated command prompt and formated the disk using cmd.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I used a recovery tool (recuva) to recover the unencrypted portion (around 70%).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't think there is any way to recover the full data, as I researched a lot during the last month.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The best you can do in case of partially encrypted disks, is to format and the recover the unencrypted portion. Lot's of people had the same problem posted in different forums, and as far as I searched (really far!), there was no comprehensive solution
 in sight.</div>

<h2>            where to download windows 10 version 1709 in may 2018</h2>
                    <p>i have several ethereum mining rigs that were on windows 10 version 1709 and worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for a reason i do not understand, when i manually updated to verson 1803 i started having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>affected computers became slow and suffered random freezing requiring power down reboot and the operating systems were corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tied to go back to the previous windows 10 version but cannot.&nbsp; i think doing a reset wiped out the previous version information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since i think that is impossible to revert to version 1709 i want to download 1709 and do a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i looked on the internet for 1709 download but can't find it.&nbsp; at this time i only can find version 1803 to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please let me know how to download windows 10 version 1709.</p>
