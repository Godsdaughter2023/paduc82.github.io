    <title>Printing Errors after KB3178466 Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing Errors after KB3178466 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Clients have reported many printing issues after the update KB3178466, more specific related to KB3176493(win 10).</p>
<p>This is a security update related to the windows Kernel-Mode Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Backstory:</span></p>
<p>We have developed a word addin, that does some mail merge and generates a chain of documents, and when our clients click on Print all documents button, it sends 1st page to tray x of their printer, and sends the remaining pages to tray y, and does the same
 for all present documents of that chain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The issues are:</span></p>
<p>After the update, they are reporting that some pages are not printing at all. You can see that they are all sent to the printer, they are all in the print spooler, but some pages or even some complete documents don't print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others are reporting that some pages print then they get a PCL XL Error</p>
<p>Subsystem: i/O</p>
<p>Error: InputReadError</p>
<p>Operator: EndPAge</p>
<p>Position: 491</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is some printers spit out this message and terminate, while others just terminate with no visible errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug after the update, or is there a solution or is there&nbsp;something&nbsp;on our side that is causing this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Audio driver keeps failing</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP envy laptop with Windows 10 (64-bit), Everything went well untill last week, i started getting this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio of my laptop keeps failing suddenly, I tried everything which i found on google, but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the audio driver from the device manager and scan for hardware changes, so that the OS can install the default driver, that didnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the driver and try updating from my computer by doing as shown below, this works for sometime and after that audio is gone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/476caa66-8ce8-4041-9893-6073e99a387e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/476caa66-8ce8-4041-9893-6073e99a387e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing realtek audio driver instead of the generic driver we get with windows, that didnt work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even checked if there is some problem with the driver, i checked in the properties</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0064f610-1e4e-4b42-a162-1913caa3a662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0064f610-1e4e-4b42-a162-1913caa3a662" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to downgrade to windows 8.1 from windows 10, but got the same issue in windows 8.1 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out. Thanks in advance ....!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to download and install the latest chipset drivers, BIOS drivers&nbsp;from the computer manufacturer's website and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer: <strong><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-envy-15-j000-notebook-pc-series/5354982/model/6532323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drivers for HP ENVY 15-j011dx Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR)</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>NOTE: </strong></span><span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to perform System Restore to the earlier point prior to this issue and check if it helps.
<span>When you perform a System Restore the time and date would be changed on your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such
 as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file
 loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend you to refer to the Microsoft article to perform System Restore:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>Section: <strong>
<span>Restore from a system restore&nbsp;point.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to us with an updated status of this issue for further assistance.</p>

<h3> markgrove  say:</h3>
<h2>            error code 5 Tom Clancey&#39;s HAWX 2</h2>
                    This is a Ubisoft game had been playing the game for months when all of the sudden it says error 5 can not find dump file . I think it is on the providers side of the fence , but other games are able to play from same provider. Example HAWX plays without
 a problem at the same provider. This is not the first time this has happened. Can you point me in the right direction to find maybe a backdoor fix . I have tried all the current on-line ideas. My son is stuck in a chair and this is his only release .So any
 help would be very much appricated! Thanks Mark Grove

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The latest update for the game seems to have fixed the issue for other users, I would suggest that you uninstall the game completely and then reinstall the game.</p>
<p>To uninstall a program refer:</p>
<p><b>Uninstall or change a program</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></p>
<p>Once you uninstall the game get in touch with the UBISOFT support for information on the update.</p>

            <p>Hello Flowalker</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory Windows Live Photo Gallery does not save the photo's. It only reads those that it can find on your computers hard disk, cloud or any other storage device / medium. You should try to look in the folders where these pictures where saved if they are
 still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely Windows Live Photo Gallery simply didn't index them and therefore are not shown in the program. The pictures itself should not be gone however. What did you do before this happened? Did you reinstall anything or moved anything?</p>

I recently upgraded to Windows 10, I had iTunes before the upgrade and it worked fine, since the upgrade it hasn't. When I click on the Short Cut it says "Windows cannot find file c:\program files\iTunes" So I went to C: clicked on the Program Files, then clicked
 on iTunes and when I click the iTunes application there to open it, I get "Windows cannot find file c:\program files\iTunes\iTunes.exe Make sure that you typed the file name correctly, and then try again" which is frustrating because I am clicking directly
 on the file location itself. So I right click and open properties on the file and it says its a .exe application file. I know that it is not iTunes because I completely uninstalled iTunes, restarted my computer, and then re-installed iTunes and still same
 thing. I did uninstall/re-install numerous times, even to different file locations and still the same thing. I have checked the system for errors, did a disk cleanup and defrag, I have done everything I know to do and still the same message. What am I missing?

    <title>Arc Touch Mouse &#124; Surface Edition can&#39;t Pair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bravefanataic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Arc Touch Mouse &#124; Surface Edition can&#39;t Pair</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to pair my mouse with a new laptop PC but it won't pair.&nbsp; The bluetooth pair light won't come on when I press and hold the button. I've tried holding it down as long as 30 seconds with no response and no detection from multiple PCs.&nbsp; I also
 tried the obvious of changing the batteries. This is the second Arc Touch mouse I own that this has mysteriously started happening to.&nbsp; I've found similar issues in other forums, but no solutions so far.&nbsp; Any serious help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Summary of
 things I've tried are below</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Replaced batteries</p>
<p>2. Held blue tooth pair button down a various amount of times ranging from 3-30 seconds.</p>
<p>3. Tried searching for the device from multiple PCs/laptops/tablets.</p>
<p>4. Contacted Microsoft Hardware support by phone but call always seemed to disconnect after they had me try OS/Software related things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do these Arc Touch Surface edition mice stick to the first device you pair them with forever? If not Is there some secret method I'm missing that clears the mouse and allows it to pair to a new device.&nbsp; I own multiple bluetooth devices (keyboards, headsets,
 game controllers) and never had this issue before. I also have an older Microsoft Wedge mouse which has been rock solid between multiple devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is frustrating as this is the second mouse this has inexplicably happened to.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if this resolves the issue.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows key + W and type troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select Troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select View all on the top left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Hardware and Devices.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Follow the on-screen instruction to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your Bluetooth mouse isn’t working, doesn’t appear in the list of Bluetooth devices when you pair the mouse, or you see an error message during
 pairing, here are some things to try.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your mouse is paired with your PC</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press and hold the pairing button on your mouse for 5-7 seconds, then let the button go. The light will blink to show that the mouse is discoverable.
 The pairing button is usually on the bottom of the mouse.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On your PC, select the Start button, then select Settings&gt;Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Make sure Bluetooth is on, then select Add Bluetooth or other device &gt; Bluetooth. Choose your mouse from in the list of devices. Follow any
 other instructions if they appear, then select done.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please refer the Microsoft article:

<li>
<p><span><strong>Was there any changes made in software or hardware?</strong> No changes. As stated it started after I tried to pair it to a new PC/Laptop and the pairing indicator light never comes on the ARC mouse when I hold the pairing
 button down.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><strong>Are you trying for the first time to connect or was it working before?
</strong>No it's not the first time.&nbsp; Both worked on the previous laptop.&nbsp; They only stopped working after I tried to pair them to a new one.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions but those are the normal steps I already took and unfortunately none worked. Because the pair light doesn't come on either I think it's a glitch with the mice memory that happened when pairing to a new device or other bluetooth
 devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;The same thing happened for both mice.</p>

<h2>            Mail keeps shutting down in Windows 10</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10 recently, and I've finally gotten around to working with the different apps. This morning, I've tried to reply to an email three times now, and each time I open the draft, the entire Mail app shuts down. What's going on? The app
 is no good if I can't write or send email.

            <p>I too have upgraded to Windows 10. I had some initial trouble (mail app crashed) with my login but this resolved (? how I'm not sure). However on my wife's log in the program will crash in a short period of time. Usually about the time it takes to load go
 to settings and then attempt to change something and app/program closes. I have no idea why this occurs with one log in and not the other. Obviously a conflict somewhere with something. Any help would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addit: I think I fixed the problem by changing the sync days to 3. I just had to move the mouse fast and save before things got too hard. This seems to have worked then I have been able to change it to 7 after a few min. It is not crashing at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does seem to be significantly better than 8.1 but these little issues with mail have tried my patience. Too many more things that take time and I'll change to a mac.</p>

            This didn't do anything for me either.&nbsp; Email has just about enough time to show me the body of the first email before it shuts down, any clicking anywhere and it crashes.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshooting app and no issues found.&nbsp; Ignoring this problem - why
 do people like Win10?&nbsp; The start tiles lack the life of Win8 and what users thought adding interactions was better??

            I am having the same problem with Windows 10 Mail shutting down within about 10 seconds of it being opened. The problem seems to have started after I signed up to use Outlook.com and added my three email accounts to it, the same three accounts that had
 been added to Windows Mail.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem and other Mail app problems are obviously beyond the wit of Microsoft so sort out. With a bit of unpaid trial and error, searches and plagiarism I've achieved a solution where Microsoft have crashed and burned - again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick one of these;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1</p>
<p>Dump your original profile account and create a new one, don't dump the original until you've secured your files and the Mail app' will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2</p>
<p>If you want to keep your current profile you'll need to dump the Mail app and reinstall, this takes a bit more effort;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open PowerShell as an administrator. Open the Start menu, search for “PowerShell,” right-click the PowerShell shortcut, and select “Run as administrator.”
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem and other Mail app problems are obviously beyond the wit of Microsoft so sort out. With a bit of unpaid trial and error, searches and plagiarism I've achieved a solution where Microsoft have crashed and burned - again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick one of these;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1</p>
<p>Dump your original profile account and create a new one, don't dump the original until you've secured your files and the Mail app' will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2</p>
<p>If you want to keep your current profile you'll need to dump the Mail app and reinstall, this takes a bit more effort;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open PowerShell as an administrator. Open the Start menu, search for “PowerShell,” right-click the PowerShell shortcut, and select “Run as administrator.”
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-AppxPackage *windowscommunicationsapps* | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>

<p>Disabling <strong>AutoPlay</strong> in your Windows 10 settings will probably do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the <strong>Settings</strong>, and click on the <strong>Devices</strong> icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54c414fd-b10a-4895-864c-2858b7fcfda7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54c414fd-b10a-4895-864c-2858b7fcfda7" height="280" width="429" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on <strong>AutoPlay</strong>, and switch&nbsp;on/off <strong>Use AutoPlay for all media and devices</strong>. With this switched off, you will never see the AutoPlay window pop up.</p>
<p>However, you can also leave AutoPlay on, and customize how it works. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Choose AutoPlay Defaults</strong>, select the default action you want AutoPlay to perform&nbsp;when you connect&nbsp;each&nbsp;type of media or&nbsp;device.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3996bc8-e3cf-4dc5-8f6b-1f781524dc17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3996bc8-e3cf-4dc5-8f6b-1f781524dc17" height="343" width="458" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also press and hold the <strong>Shift key</strong> when your insert your backup drive to open an AutoPlay notification, regardless of the default setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, did <strong>File Explorer</strong> launched again when you plugged in your backup drive?</p>

    <title>why does the windows 10 power menu always have &#34;update&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomhorsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does the windows 10 power menu always have &#34;update&#34; options right after I finish an update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I do an update (which I always do manually because I have the network claiming to be metered), I eventually get to the point where I click on the "Restart Now" button in the windows update screen in settings. Everything always seems to work fine,
 but after it has finished the update, the Power menu always has just "update and shutdown" and "update and restart" entries available. The update really did install correctly (I can see it in history).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I pick "update and restart", the system restarts just fine, with no messages about updating or "do not power off", and when it comes back after this totally redundant restart the power menu is back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it forget to reset the menu if I didn't click on the menu?</p>

<h2>            Customisability</h2>
                    <p>This topic has been in my mind for quite some time for now. It feels like whenever there's any problem with technology, it's always because the users can't customise their devices and because they aren't given options. And if a customer has to Google how
 to customise something, it's not honestly an option you are giving to them. Things in Windows 10 to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to use UI from any version of Windows since Windows 1.0.</li><li>Instead of choosing from 48 possible accent colours we should have a colour wheel.</li><li>You can change your screen's contrast, gamma, tone and saturation. Great job there. Now how about voice? Volume and balance. Is this a joke?</li><li>Screen brightness options in Windows 10: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. First of all, I expect my screen to be black when the brightness is set to zero. Why would the user want to have a screen (s)he can't use? I don't know, but it's their computer, they have
 to be able to do that if they want to. Second, it would be nice if I could set it to be any natural number.</li><li>To be continued.</li></ul>

            I'm not sure how they could possibly implement the interface of windows 1. It had no Start, windows could not overlap,. maximum resolution around 640x480. Lots of other things.

            I don't see how this is relevant. Your resolution would be 640x480, you'd have no access to start menu and you could not overlap windows.

<h2>            How is Windows.old built&#63; How can Windows.old be restored&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>1. Is it true what this guy is saying that the Windows.old folder is automatically abated by Windows 8 and without asking for any permission?</div>
<div><a href="http://windows8-drivers.com/windows-8-drivers/windows-old-files-are-deleted-automatically-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows8-drivers.com/windows-8-drivers/windows-old-files-are-deleted-automatically-in-windows-8/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>About 6 weeks ago I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 8. As it's&nbsp;known, this installation doesn't&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;the older system's settings and applications. Instead, a Windows.old folder is created and saved for later use. Then I used PCMover to transfer almost
 all the XP environment onto Windows 8. (This PCMover has the advantage that you can select what you want to transfer.) When I recently tried to re-run PCMover, I found that a lot of files were missing from the Windows.old folder. I have not tampered with the
 Windows.old folder (no virus, no malware). The “Program Files” subfolder only contains about 10 subfolders, out of the original 100 (or so)! And the Windows subfolder only contains 4 files now! No wonder PCMover cannot work. Note again I am speaking about
 the subfolders of Windows.old!</p>
<p>2. The main question is: How was this Windows.old built?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>Is it just a plain collection of the 3 folders of the previous system (XP, in my case), namely “Documents and Settings”, “Program Files” and&nbsp;“Windows”? Or did the update installation add some other “helpful” obscure files?</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If the Windows 8 update installation just preserved those 3 old folders, then can I restore the Windows.old folder just by copying those 3 subfolders from the XP backup (which I happened to keep)?</p>
<p>Is there any other method to restore Windows.old?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. How can one prevent Windows 8 from chewing away Windows.old?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

            <div>Hi Sorein, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the query, you are unable to find the files in Windows.old folder which was created when you upgraded to
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 8 from Windows XP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to ask few questions on behalf of this issue:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Did you select the option to keep personal files when you </div>
<div>upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows XP?<br />
2) How did you perform the Upgrade installation on the computer?<br />
3) Are you able to find the personal files in the Windows.old folder?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would like to let you know the when you upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 8; you will be able to keep personal files only if you have selected to keep them at the time of installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to check for such information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“<strong>Upgrade to Windows 8</strong>”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<b>Transferring settings, apps, and files</b>”:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Note: </b>If you choose not to keep your files when you upgrade to Windows 8, your files will be temporarily saved to the Windows. old folder (unless you formatted your hard drive before installing) . If you decide you want some or all of these files
 back, you can still retrieve them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also retrieve the files from Windows .old folder. You can refer to the link to do so:</div>

            <p>Would you like to just answer the questions, instead of asking "silly" questions?</p>
<p>If I have WIndows.old, of course I had opted to keep the files - d'uh!</p>
<p>It was an In-place upgrade.</p>
<p>Windows.old was initially full of older XP files (accessible by program transfer applications). and how it is a wreck, a lot of folders and files are missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please review the questions and answer them.</p>
<p>Or have someone knowledgable respond.</p>
<p>Danke.</p>

            Hi sorein,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to answer the question in the following way:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) No, Windows.old folder does not get automatically deleted from the ocmputer without user's permission.</div>
<div>2) Windows.old folder is built when you upgrade the operating system to Windows 8.The contents fo those files depends on the operating system from which you upgrade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From Windows 7--Apps, Windows settings, and personal files.</div>
<div><br />
From Windows Vista--Windows settings and personal files. <br />
<br />
From Windows XP--Personal files<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3) No, there are no methods to restore Windows .old folder if the folder has got deleted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4) Windows 8 does not interfere with the files or contents of Windows.old folder. I would suggest you to check if there is any difference in memory size of the Windows .old folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it answers the questions.</div>

            I kinda found the answer on my own, with some pain ;)
<div><br />
<div>Windows.old IS&nbsp;chewed&nbsp;away by&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8, within one month since the upgrade, and it does it&nbsp;surreptitiously, without the knowledge or the consent of the user. This "automation" is good for some (Windows.old may take 10 GB), but a disaster for others.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A degraded Windows.old may only be restored by copying the old system's folders (Documents and Settings, Program Files, Windows), that is ONLY if the user had the inspiration to make a backup BEFORE the upgrade. The 3-party applications that can transfer
 the XP programs and settings can use Windows.old restored that way.</div>

            Ok, it's working for me so far, but a bit slow.
<div><br />
<div>1. Try going back to the <b>Indexing Options</b>&nbsp;in Control Panel and see if OS (C:) or your main hard drive is listed in the "Included Locations"</div>
<div>2. If not, click modify and tick the box for OS (C:) or your hard drive. There is a small arrow next to the box where you can expand the list, and you want to make sure that the "Windows" folder is checked, because that's where the computer settings are
 located.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.Click OK and now the "Included Locations" list should include your OS (C:) or main hard drive. At the top it shows how many items are indexed and it should start going up. The indexing takes a while for me though.</div>
<div>4.Try using the Search Charm to search for settings. At first, I didn't get any results, but after a few hours of indexing, results are finally showing up under "Settings" filter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck and I hope you got the same results I did. It's frustrating that the indexing locations seemed to have changed when I upgraded to 8.1...</div>

            <p>your disk is dirty and windows wants to clean it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest burning a cd of Hiren's boot disk and running the<strong><u> recovery console</u></strong> from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this may work for a while but your disk may be ready to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can use ImgBurn to burn to a cd:</p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font><font><b><u>Anywho, to make a Hiren's boot CD, do this:<br />
</u></b><br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music.) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<br />
</font></font></font><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</font></a><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page, do not click on any ads).<br />
</font><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/</font></a></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Instructions</font></p>
<p><br />
<font color="#000000">Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD..<b>iso
</b>in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way...<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.20 from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://rufus.akeo.ie/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font color="#000000">I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.<b>iso </b>that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop</font></p>

<p>that is why I would recommend the hiren's recovery console.</p>

Hey <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b7b74c16-c758-453e-bfb3-8b61a6c0b009">
BethWarnke</a> try doing these.....<br />
<br />
a ) Go to Start...Run...and type in "<b>sysdm.cpl</b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
-Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
-then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
-then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
-then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
b ) In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
c ) Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
d ) Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step b ). Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
e ) Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Thanks to New avatar (a camel) for this post.....<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't work then Right click on the C drive in Explorer and go Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Check Now (under Error Checking). Check both boxes then click "Start Now". A message will pop up saying that Error Checking will run after you restart the computer.
 Restart the computer and Error Checking will run automatically after the restart. After it’s finished it will restart into Windows automatically...<br />

            You can use a SP2 CD to boot into the RC to run chkdsk, but since we don't know anything about the afflicted system, that may not work if the system has SATA drives, if the system had no functioning CD/DVD drive or if the OP does not have a genuine bootable
 XP installation CD - none of this is known.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This is why the MS Answers forums needs to ask these questions up front when a new topic is started.<br />
<br />
If all those things check out favorably you could boot into RC and run the chkdsk but then what if they can't get past the Administrator password part?&nbsp; That happens alot too so they're stuck (you an fix this, but you have to boot on something else to fix it).<br />
<br />
If you make a Hiren's boot CD or USB, that will <i>always </i>work for all scenarios (so far), so I am leaning to suggest that more and more since the rest of the questions become irrelevant - Hiren's will
<i>always </i>work (so far) if you want to run a chkdsk.&nbsp; Hiren's deals with and/or doesn't care about that other stuff.&nbsp; It may not fix this problem, but is will always a good way to get you started.<br />
<br />
I don't know where Andrew E gets that 10-15 minuted thing :-), it takes my system about 4 hours to run a chkdsk with error correction.&nbsp; Actually I don't know how long it really takes, but it is several hours on a 1TB drive that has less than 100GB of stuff
 on it, so if you are ever going to suggest it, I would always include this reminder:<br />
<br />
<p>Depending on the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be
 patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

this Technet article</a>:<br />
<br />
<i>If you use <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> on a very large disk (for example, 70 gigabytes) or a disk with a very large number of files (for example, millions of files),
<strong>chkdsk</strong> might take a long time (for example, <b>over several days</b>) to complete. The computer is not available during this time because
<strong>chkdsk</strong> does not relinquish control until it is finished.</i><br />
<br />
That is usually not the case nowadays, but was in the good old days.<br />

I thought I read once that MS also said a week or more but can't find that...<br />

            Yeow.<br />
<br />
Another reason it might take an extra long time (and everything takes a long time) is if it is an IDE drive and the Transfer Mode has slipped from DMA mode to PIO mode.&nbsp; This is a good thing to check when there are performance problems and often overlooked.&nbsp;
 Everything else could check out fine, but before you are done, it never hurts to check this when doing a
<i>tune up</i>.<br />
<br />
See?&nbsp; If the MS Answers would ask these questions up front when a new topic is created, things would go alot smoother.<br />
<br />
Here is how to check for that:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are using IDE drives, use Device Manager to verify the Transfer Mode of the IDE channels is set to something like DMA if available (depends on your hardware) and not the slower PIO mode.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Remember:&nbsp; PIO is the slowest, DMA is the fastest.<br />
<br />
This is easy to check and generally easy to fix and the mode would not have changed by itself,so if it has changed to PIO, change it to DMA and then figure out why it changed and fix it.<br />
<br />
To launch the Device Manager console, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
devmgmt.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK.<br />
<br />
Expand the IDE/ATA controller section to see your IDE channels. Right click each, choose Properties, and for each channel that has an Advanced Settings tab, determine the Transfer Mode.&nbsp; There are usually 4 channels to check in a desktop, maybe fewer for laptops.&nbsp;
 Check them all.<br />
<br />
The fastest selection will always be some kind of DMA selection (usually: DMA, DMA5, DMA if available, UDMA, etc.).&nbsp; If it is PIO, change it to DMA.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
If you are not sure about what you see post back for help and advice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
If you make any adjustments, reboot and check the settings again to make sure any changes "stick".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
What may have caused the change?<br />

            I semi-resolved the problem by eliminating clink - a command processor enhancement. But I should not have had to do that.

<h2>            After updating to Win 10, I&#39;ve lost all bass.</h2>
                    So ive recently updated from windows 8.1 to 10 on my Asus S500C. I had great bass and audio quality before the upgrade. However, now it sounds like I'm using 5 dollar headphones that get no bass whatsoever. Ive tried updating the drivers, fiddling with
 the enhancement settings, fiddling with the sound settings. Nothing has worked. Any ideas?

            Hi James,
<br />
<br />No, that will not affect your login to OneDrive, Outlook or any other Microsoft Service - all services will switch over to the new password, but the login process should remain the same . . .
