<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am not sure if you can still access the folder on your flash drive. Trojan Horse Sheur is a powerful virus and it would have damaged the files
 on the <br />
folder.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it is an important folder, then first scan the flash drive again for any infections and make sure there are no traces of the trojan and then<br />
transfer the folder to your hard drive and try to access it. You can do this at your own risk. However, the best practice would be to format the flash drive.</span></span></p>

    <title>ogg file wont open automatically with Audacity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenbrown_775  say:</h3>
<h2>            ogg file wont open automatically with Audacity</h2>
                    <p>I'm so frustrated with Win10. I can't find anything and can't make anything work. I downloaded an
<strong>ogg editor</strong> called <strong>Audacity</strong>, and downloaded an ogg file that I want to edit. For some reason, the ogg file only wants to be opened by
<strong>CyberLink </strong>(Power Media Player), which I know nothing about and do not have installed. I want it to open automatically with
<strong>Audacity</strong>. It took me all evening (like 6 hours, since I cannot use SEARCH FILE as I have done for 20 years) to find the Audacity program. It is located at
<em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Audacity\audacity.exe</em>. If I right-click the CyberLink ogg file and try to add this audacity.exe to the list, instead of adding it, it just opens the file with Audacity, and when I export the file (can't save, have to export),
 it is still a CyberLink file. I don't want CyberLink, I want Audacity. Why is this so hard in Win10? PS--I tried some of the suggestions in some previous answers here about file associations, but none of them worked for me.</p>

            <p>Answer not helpful. It is a Windows 10 problem, not an Audacity problem. The Audacity program was just an example, it could have happened with any other program that creates and edits files. The problem requires someone with expertise in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept working on the problem and eventually I managed to get the ogg file to exhibit the Audacity icon rather than the CyberLink icon, which means that clicking the file will now cause Audacity to open it successfully. I tried a lot of different things,
 and spent hours searching my computer for pertinent program files (SEARCH does not work on Win10 like it did on Win7 and all earlier versions, and I have not figured out how to find files other than by manual search). I spent so much time on this, and tried
 so many different things, that it is hard to say how I finally managed to solve the problem. I can tell you that, in Windows 7 and all previous versions, this could be fixed in a single, simple action ... but with Windows 10, the solution required multiple
 actions. If I can analyze it and figure out how I did it, I will post the solution here.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update from 1809 to 1903 fails with  0xc1900101</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual boot system with Opensuse Tumbleweed and Windows 10 Pro. During the previous feature update from 1803 to 1809 I could not get it to work and resorted to a clean reinstall. I would like to avoid that if possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code 0xc1900101 seems to suggest a driver problem, but I have not been able to see anything in the logs.
</p>
<p>
I've tried multiple upgrade attempts including from bootable USB (copied to my hard drive) created via the Media Creation tool. All have failed with the same error. This evening I ran the following command to see if it could help identify the problem
</p><p>
</p><p>G:\Windows-1903&gt;<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">SETUP.EXE /Auto Upgrade /NoReboot /DynamicUpdate Disable /Compat ScanOnly</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>after that ran i copied the contents of the following folder to my OneDrive and the shared link to it is here</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Panther</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>any help to get my windows 10 upgraded to 1903 would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anything else needed to help with the diagnosis, please ask and I'll do my best to provide it.</p>

            Hi Charles,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Please run the upgrade again and let it fail. Share the logs with Device Install-Log.
<br />
<br />Let us check the Installation log to find why the update failed. Please share the logs as mentioned in this article.
<br />

<p>when I tried to do the update in place using bootable usb drive created from the media creation tool. That generated the following error<br />
<br />
&nbsp;0xC1900101 - 0x20017 </p>
<p>
</p><p>if you want me to I can run that update again tomorrow. <br />
<br />
can you tell me the location of the Device Install-Log and the windows install logs&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>I checked this location ==&gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Only if the error code is 0xC1900101]&nbsp;</strong>The Device Install Log from
<strong>C:/<span>$Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback\setupapi\setupapi.dev.log
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>and it does not exist on my Windows C: drive,&nbsp; I'll try the media creation tool upgrade option and see if it gets created.</span></p>
<p>is this the correct location of the install logs&nbsp; ==&gt; C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Panther</p>

 to leave behind some registry entries which I've been unable to remove. Even after VMWARE uninstall the 1903 update fails.</p>

</p><p>Thanks, I did do that this afternoon and it resolved some of the issues. I found 2 OEM*.INF files which were blocking, Windows Print to PDF and Windows Print XPS and I used Windows features and turned them both off.<br />
<br />
I only have one language installed, English.<br />
<br />
After that I tried the install from the ISO and it still failed however the size and number of errors reported in Panther\setuperror.log was much less. I zipped what I thought was the relevant files from the Panther and Rollback directories and added them to
 OneDrive as follows.</p>

</p><p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated. This has been more painful that I thought it would be.</p>

<h2>            Wireless connectivity not working - star in strength icon</h2>
                    For some reason my windows 8 HP laptop will not connect to the network. Well, actually it says it's connected but will not allow me to do anything. I can't go into the network and sharing center to change anything there. Nothing works. It's almost as if
 I have been changed from administrator to a limited user. The only clue I have is that there is a star above the signal strength icon in the system tray.<br />
Anybody got an idea of what is happening and how I can fix it?<br />
Thanks<br />

            This is a wireless connection. The star icon appears to be a symptom of something much more extensive.<br />
With the star icon in the wireless signal strength icon I cannot do many things. I can't launch Task Manager, I can't make any changes to the network. I can't configure anything in network and sharing, I can try to launch link to network but then the window
 just hangs.<br />
The problem has gone away, temporarily. I rebooted to clear the hung windows. Now I can connect but this has happened before. I have no idea why, nobody seems to have any idea of what causes it or how you can fix it, and I have seen a couple of other posts
 online in different forums of people with similar problems.<br />
This is on an HP laptop. I'd say that maybe it's a problem with some piece of HP software, but I don't think they have anything that can reduce you to a crippled user. The user profile is administrator still.<br />

    <title>Faulty Day One edition controller - poor support from MS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sigmathedj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Faulty Day One edition controller - poor support from MS</h2>
                    
<p>I bought 2 Xbox One Day One editions on Friday along with a bunch of games. I spent about £1,000 in total. One of the consoles is a gift, so it hasn't been used yet, but the other is mine, so I've been using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The left bumper on the controller doesn't work properly. It doesn't click like the right bumper does, and sometimes when I press it, the press is not registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retailer will only replace the whole package, which I really don't want to do just for a faulty controller, plus they have none left in stock anyway, so I called MS support last night. I was on the phone for over 40 minutes while the customer support
 agent was trying to sort it out for me. He told me that I would be sent a pre-paid bag so I could send the faulty controller back and MS would send me a new one, except it could take up to 28 days for the new one to arrive - not very good! But he was unable
 to process the replacement as his computer system was down, so in the end he said he'd call me back today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customer service agent called me back today and said he could now start the replacement process for me, except then he said I would have to pay to send the controller back to Prague. I live in the UK. This isn't very good customer support is it? I'm
 not blaming the customer service guy, as he was very friendly and polite and tried his best to help me, but he can only do what MS allows him to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have 2 choices now. I can either buy a new controller for £44 and then pay out of my own money to get my Day One edition controller replaced, or I can just pay to get my Day One edition controller replaced, except then I might not be able to use my
 console for up to 28 days as I'd have no controller. Surely you can do better than this, Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Sigma.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly sorry to hear about the mishap you are experiencing with the controller. I unfortunately &nbsp;I can suggest calling back and again and insuring that they correctly quoted you that price for a faulty controller.If anything the cost of shipping the controller
 probably cannot be avoided. As for the retailer again, I would reach for a manager and see if they can help you out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach back and let us know what you find out.</p>

<p>I'm not paying to ship the controller and PSU (which is also faulty) to Prague, then waiting up to 28 days for replacements which, judging by the posts in this forum section, have a good chance of not working properly either. MS are one of the wealthiest
 companies that exist, yet they want me to pay to have faulty components of a brand new console replaced? I don't think so. It's a matter of principle as much as it is about the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retailer has no stock. I tried the retailer first, as if they had stock they would have just replaced the entire package for me, but all they can offer me is a refund.</p>

<p>MS has an agreement with retailers to swap the controllers over - They should do this for you. If they deny it - Demand it - I am on my 3rd controller now and working fine!!! I was never going to take the whole console back just for a controller and they
 were very good about it - Your console works! It doesnt have the disc drive issue dont change that for anything!!!! Keep what works and change what doesnt MS support will agree with this in a chat, then &nbsp;print off the chat and take it to your retailer if they
 say they wont honour it</p>

<p>I don't think that's true mate, at least, not in the UK. I spoke to the retailer and they had no stock of the console bundles. They offered me a full refund. I don't know why they would do that if they have a bunch of spare controllers knocking about, considering
 they would lose money by giving me a refund. This is a Day One Edition controller, so I don't want it replacing with a regular controller - I want a fully working Day One controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had 4 phone conversations with MS. In the first one, I was promised a replacement controller at no cost to me. In the second one, I was told I could not have the replacement controller at no cost to me. In the third one, I was told that I could have
 a replacement console bundle at no cost to me. In the fourth one, I was told that I could not have a replacement console bundle at all and I was back to square one again. Xbox Support on Twitter told me that someone would contact me about this issue, but nobody
 has. They simply do not care. I've sent my story to Watchdog, which is a hugely popular consumer affairs show on BBC TV here in the UK. I would advise anyone in the UK that's had similar issues to do the same, because MS need to be called out publicly about
 this, otherwise they will continue treating paying customers like dirt.</p>

<p>I did get my issue resolved, but only by being lucky and getting the attention of someone very high up at MS. Once he got involved, things were resolved very quickly. I was also told that MS are discussing ways that they can improve customer service for
 people who are currently being told that they have to pay to ship faulty components to Prague. I can't really offer you a solution to your problem unfortunately, other than to say that all I did is make some noise, both on Twitter and via email, and I was
 lucky that it caught the attention of the right person. The tier 1 support and supervisors on the phone only told me that there was no alternative to pay, so I do sympathise and I hope you get it sorted out soon.</p>

<p>I have the Call of Duty Advance Warfare bundle, No connection for wireless controllers, have to have them plugged in via USB, also no chat. I bought a separate MS official Chat connector for Headsets. I have tried via Astro Mix Amp, just Headset, and the
 chat headset that came with the Xbox. 2 Parts of the same Bundle not working. Got a scuf'ed up Advance Warfare Controller, no wireless connection or chat. MS said I would have to send the entire bundle in, pay shipping to them, they would pay shipping back.
 I am disabled with back and walking issues. I don't have ability or the money to do this. I spent the back pay money I got from SSD, but now I only have $$ for living expenses and hired help.</p>
<p>I wanted to use the Xbox One to connect to people, but with out microphone I can't. Also the no wireless connect (I tired everything in every forum, and I know about the little button on side of console) because sometimes I would like to lay in my bed and
 watch movies or twitch or MLG or YT. But the connect cord is 6ft so is too short to reach my bed. So I make due with my 360 wireless controller, but sad 'cause I want high rez (I bought 2x BenQ XL2430T 24" Monitors just for new console).</p>
<p>I'm posting here 'cause maybe someone will see and help, and 'cause I just needed to vent after reading your posts.</p>

            Hi Barbara.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible that the credit was to your MS Account while his is a separate account?  You may need to sign into his account to do this.
<br />
<br />You can contact MS Store support here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jai,
<div><br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.<br />
<br />
Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow these methods below to resolve the issue: </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Network troubleshooter:</span></strong> &nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
Open the Network Adapter troubleshooter by typing &nbsp; troubleshooting in the search box, and then tapping or clicking Troubleshooting. Tap or click Network and Internet, tap or click Network Adapter, and follow the instructions on your screen. R</span>estart
 the computer to check, if this helps. &nbsp; &nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
Try to follow these steps in the links, given in the Microsoft KB articles, mentioned below:<br />
<br />
<strong>How do I fix network adapter problems?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">

 &nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> the above link applies to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, follow the Method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try a different network adapter or network connection type to check, if that works.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>You may also reset the Wi-Fi router to check, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, follow the Method 3.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 3: </span></span></span></strong></p>
<div>
<p><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try to reset Winsock and check, if it works. Refer to these steps, mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows + X</strong>&nbsp;key and click on
<strong>Command prompt&nbsp;(Admin).</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Type the following command and hit enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;netsh winsock reset</span></span></strong></p>
<div><br />
If your system has a wireless (Wi‑Fi) network adapter, you'll see the wireless network icon Wireless network icon when you click the Settings on the Notification area. Windows automatically detects wireless networks that are in range.

            Not able to download file uploaded to Baidu, hence below analysis is based only on the file which you have uploaded to Onedrive.
<br />
<br />Analysis Results
<br />
<br />File Name: 111818-17171-01.dmp
<br />BugCheck 109
<br />Probably caused by : Unknown_Image ( ANALYSIS_INCONCLUSIVE )
<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />
<br />Third Party Drivers
<br />None
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Since analysis is inconclusive, hence I am not sure what is the root cause. On the basis of my experience, a third party driver happens to be the cause in most of the cases. Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            Hi,
<br />Please run driver verifier.
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:

<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<h3> jim &#40;vaelek&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Universal Windows apps do not resize correctly</h2>
                    <p>I've been having an issue with random apps for a while now and it just dawned on me that everything having this issue, is a universal app.</p>
<p>Enlarging the window beyond the size it launched at, results in the contents scaling, the borders moving accordingly, but a big transparent hole between the initial edge(s) and the new ones. If I enlarge the window and close it (which has to be done via
 the taskbar button since there is no control box visible), then it's good at that size on the next launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Words don't explain it that well, so this is a recording of what's happening.</p>

    <title>RECEIVING an SMS via skype to my mobile phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RECEIVING an SMS via skype to my mobile phone</h2>
                    <p>**** I know how to send, my question is how to RECEIVE SMS via Skype to my mobile phone, Thank you :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest Skype version for Mac (Skype version 8.32.0.44) and I have the paid version- a USA ph# and free international long distance.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to receive text messages/SMS via Skype. I've read that the messages would be send to my mobile phone (and not Skype). That's fine, but I'm unable to set that up. It says go to: Skype- Preferences- Messaging- Verify your phone #<br />
<br />
BUT i do not have an option to Verify your phone # under the Messaging setting.<br />
<br />
I then tried via Skype- Preferences- Calling- Enable call forwarding and I changed the Caller ID to my mobile phone. I then got a confirmation code to my mobile phone and was able to active the Caller ID.<br />
<br />
BUT still I'm unable to receive text messages/SMS on my mobile phone.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 randomly and completely freezes</h2>
                    <p>I've been having an issue with my computer randomly freezing up like other I've seen here and other places online. Doesn't matter what I'm doing all of a sudden everything freezes, can't Crtl+Alt+Delete, turn caps lock on, move mouse, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I could find online including everything in the forums here. My patience is wearing thin. It used to be once a week or so and that was annoying but tolerable for a new OS, now months later it happens several times a day now. I really
 don't want to downgrade to windows 7. Windows 10 works great on my tablet and I like getting all my computers on the same OS.</p>

<h2>            Too many recovery partitions</h2>
                    In my win 10 which I upgraded from win 8.1, there are 3 recovery partitions of sizes 750mb, 467mb, and 7.80gb. Along with&nbsp;these recovery&nbsp;partitions, there is also one EFI system partition of size 500 MB&nbsp;and one OEM partition of size 40 MB. Why are there
 so many recovery partitions?

<p>
</p><p>If you are logged in as an administrator, you can repartition your hard disk by using the Shrink feature in Disk Management. You can shrink an existing partition or volume to create unallocated disk space, from which you can create a new partition or volume.

    <title>Windows 10 Creators update causes frame rate drops and stuttering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kemuri shinobi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators update causes frame rate drops and stuttering while gaming&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I have been trying to get Microsoft's attention in any way I can. This issue is literally rendering my gaming PC nearly useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the Creators Update I have had severe stuttering and drops in frame rate. &nbsp;I took to an online community that was having the same problems I was and they have tested this situation many times. &nbsp;With multiple combinations of Windows 10 versions
 and Nvidia driver versions, the people on the forum managed to determine that the problem develops with the Windows 10 Creators Update build 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of us suffering from this have already exhausted all the suggested remedies and the problem still persists. Some of us have been dealing with it for around three months now. &nbsp;I just recently switched to PC gaming and I'm already extremely angry and
 infuriated. It feels like they're trying to ignore us or sweep us under the rug and step over us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is interested in trying to improve the PC gaming industry, wanting to urge Microsoft to take care of their users, or just want to support a good cause come check out our forum to better understand the issues and join my Facebook group to help make
 a change.</p>

            The GeForece forums is actually where I started. I was taking to the Microsoft Community to try and reach the company on some level. &nbsp;I'm hoping to become a bit of a pest to be honest. &nbsp;I have a Facebook group for this and have been sending tweets out
 to Microsoft, Windows, and Nvidia to try and get some attention.

<p>Thanks you so much for the link. This sounds like it may be a my only option. For some reason I feel wary of editing my registry and using development tools for which I have little knowledge. &nbsp;I refuse to give Microsoft $100 of my money for an upgrade to
 Pro. &nbsp;I could use Rufus (I do have some experience with it) but where do I get a 100%, fully clean copy of Windows 10 1607, let alone OEM? &nbsp;Microsoft won't hand it out, from what I understand.</p>
<p>

<p>For anyone who has this problem that comes across this post, there is a link here for an OEM copy of Windows 10 version 1607. &nbsp;If you have a Pro, Education or Enterprise version of Windows 10, you can defer updates and remain at version 1607. &nbsp;Pairing this
 with NVIDIA drivers 378.92 should cure the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I cannot say this for sure, as I only have a Home version of Windows 10. I cannot test this at all so to be perfectly frank, I'm still screwed lol. &nbsp;If anyone here has to try this, let us know if it works, eh?</p>

<p>I can confirm this. Windows Pro and Enterprise users can roll-back the update - back to 1607.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a GTX 1080 card with driver (version): 384.76. Which at this time is the latest driver. This did not fix these issues (stuttering and FPS drops) in Windows build 1703. But after rolling back to 1607 all is working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can defer updates if you are on Pro or Enterprise. I would also recommend you stop auto-updates just to make sure. Defer does just that, it defers updates for a month or so. So if you have auto-update on it will update. Best to turn it off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately MS bundles updates (you can no longer pick and choose), so delaying updates will delay all updates, including definition updates. So be mindful.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Disk Defragmenter only displays how healthy or fragmented a disk is before the disk is defragmented. Once the process begins it will run in passes correcting and checking for fragmentation until the disk is healthy or the process finishes.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Third party defragmentation software may utilize or allow you to manipulate how many passes it does over the disk, but this is not configurable in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE</span></b><span>: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any issues resulting from the use of Third Party Software
 can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>

<h2>            Highly Unstable Wifi Connection</h2>
                    <p>From the day I bought my computer, my wifi-conectivity has been unstable. It has always been annoying me, but recently the coonection has become so unstable that I daily feel the urge to throw the laptop against a wall or out the window... So I hope somebody
 can give me the advice that will finally fix my wifi-problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The things is that my computer often disconnects (sometimes every 5 minutes or less) from the internet. When I click the wifi-icon, I usually can see my own network and the computer appears to be connected (but it doesn't work). Usually I can see lots of
 networks around me, but they vanish from the list when I lose the connection (though my own stays).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restoring the computer to its original state (I bought it with Windows 8 and updated it to Windows 10), updating the networking drivers, followed all the steps on
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/wifi-keeps-dropping-out-after-windows-10-update/e7c3d2c8-0563-4954-b3b0-ababf34bc19e">
this page</a>. I have run the various diagnostic tools I've been made aware of on different homepages, too. Nothing seems to work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody tell me what I can do to fix my connection.</p>

<p>Hi fiftycalM2,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;From where are you accessing the link?<br />
2.&nbsp;Where you able to stream that file earlier?</p>
<p>To ensure that a server running Windows Media Services can establish the best connection to the Player, the Player is configured to receive automatic streams from any of the following streaming protocols (depending on the network environment): User Datagram
 Protocol (UDP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). UDP and TCP are basic networking protocols that are used in combination with the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) to manage the high-level exchange of data. The
 Player can also receive a multicast stream.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To change protocol settings for the Player</span></strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then click
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.<br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in <strong>Now Playing</strong> mode, click the
<strong>Switch to Library</strong> button&nbsp; in the upper-right corner of the Player.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the <strong>Player Library</strong>, click <strong>Organize</strong>, and then click
<strong>Options</strong>. <br />
3.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Network</strong> tab, and then make your changes.</p>
<p><strong>Which protocols does Windows Media Player use for streaming?</strong><br />

<p>You may also run the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter and check if it works.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open the <strong>Windows Media Player Settings</strong> troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, <br />
2.&nbsp;Clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click

    <title>How to reset Windows 10 keeping files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cacadrilone  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reset Windows 10 keeping files</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to fix a windows 10 64-bit home edition on a PC, by doing a reset.</p>
<p>I am following this recipe:</p>
<p>1. Log out,</p>
<p>2. Click the Icon in the lower right part of the login screen, click Power on/off, hold down SHIFT key while selecting Restart.</p>
<p>(Computer reboots. A menu with maintenance options appear)</p>
<p>3. Select Troubleshoot -&gt; Reset this PC -&gt; Keep files option</p>
<p>(Computer reboots.)</p>
<p>A light blue screen appears with a list of keyboard layout options, under the heading Choose your keyboard layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the computer appears to be locked up in an unresponsive mode.</p>
<p>- The keyboar leds to not respond to tapping the Caps Lock or Num Lock keys,</p>
<p>- Moving and clicking the mouse has no visible response. There is no pointer on the screen.</p>
<p>- There is no harddisk activity or hd led light.</p>
<p>- The (hardware) Power button on the computer has no visible effect, except after holding it down for 5 seconds - which turns it off&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get past this?<br />
<br />
I have used the Windows 10 Media Creation tool to create an installation DVD, but when I boot from this DVD, it instructs me to<br />
remove the DVD and restart the computer from the harddisk, and only load the DVD when instructed to.<br />
Doing that gets me back to the Choose your keyboard layout screen, equally unresponsive.</p>

            <p>Hi...First of all&nbsp; are you not able to log in to&nbsp; Windows anymore?,,,.no log-in screen?...if so it sounds like your system has gone corrupt and that is why the reset does not work....you would need a 'Recovery disk' which would have to be made while the
 system is running...in this case you will probably need to 'Re-install' windows as a 'Custom' install if the 'Up-grade' choice does not allow it anymore...with your Windows 10 Media disk that you created{if it was properly made to boot} ...I run several systems
 and have run into this a couple times but I use an ISO...<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 10586 ISO</a> ...but if your computer is down then use what you have{the Media tool creation}</p>

            <p>Thanks, I shall try this after I get a new backup disk and back up all user files on C:.<br />
<br />
One question, though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say "no data loss", then "format c:". Are you sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that "format C:" means write a new (almost) empty master file table, and a new free space map. That would remove everything on the drive. C:\Users would be gone, and recreated empty</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that to reinstall the OS keeping user files, you need to delete C:\Windows\*, delete the registry HKLM, the master boot record, etc, and rewrite these from scratch, but not reformat the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that by reinstalling Windows I do have to reinstall all programs, since the registry will be reset, and since many programs want to reconfigure themselves to the exact version of the OS. I accept that.<br />
But having to restore the contents of C:\Users\XXX for each user is a nuissance if I can avoid it. (Takes additional hours, and makes me nervous.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p />

            Thanks, trbogt, I can boot up and log in fine. Only when I want to reset the OS, going through the Windows Recovery Environment (WRE), I get stuck in the "Choose your keyboard layout" screen. So I thought some component of the WRE was corrupted, and it
 should be possible to repair without wiping the drive clean first.<br />

            <p>I just reinstalled Windows 10 using a different method, where the issue of the "Choose your keyboard layout" did not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the suggested method, it resembles what I already tried several months ago, which led me straight to the non-responsive "Choose your keyboard layout" screen. True enough, I had to fiddle with the UEFI/BIOS boot options to get the PC to boot from the
 DVD, and I remember the prompt to press any key to boot from the DVD. <br />
</p>
<p>To reinstall Windows 10 I used the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool, but I selected "Upgrade this computer" instead of creating a media to install on a different computer.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It turns out that you can "upgrade" to Windows 10 even if you already have Windows 10.<br />
<br />
If I find the time, maybe I will try to see if this reinstall has fixed the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how the recovery environment is implemented? Does it use the same kernel as the regular boot? Does it have a separate partition with separate binaries? Or does it unpack some compressed image residing in a regular file? I would still like to
 know if I now have a working recovery environment for the next time I have some trouble.</p>
