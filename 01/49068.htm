<h2>            i have a scanner canoscan lide 25, that will not register for the Fax and scan program on windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    i have a scanner canoscan lide 25, that will not register for the Fax and scan program on windows 7?<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise me why the fax and scan program will not pick up the scanner? it works properlky otherwise.
<br />
<br />
It is just the fax and scan program that says "no scanners were detected. If a scanner is installed, make sure that it is powered
<br />
on and connected to the computer, and they try again. <br />
For more information about adding or troubleshooting scanners, see Help and Support"<br />
<br />
Any ideas anyone?<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been having problem with windows live mail which does not send and receive.</p>
<p>The MS guys suggested that may be due to updates therefore we restored the system by 5 days. But that did not resolve. I still get error 0x80004005</p>
Unable to send or receive messages for the Optusnet.com (matai772) account. An unknown error has occurred.
<p>Anyone can help me, please?</p>

<p>Thanks. Sadly, the error is a generic Windows one indicating an unspecified fault. Since it's occurring with different accounts on different servers,&nbsp;it's not caused by account settings.&nbsp; We've not seen other recent examples, so it probably won't be traced
 to changes within Windows. The most likely reason is interference from third-party software - e.g. an anti-virus or other security program - or possibly changes in connectivity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to identify a potential software conflict by running Windows in a clean boot state. Follow the (admittedly tedious) steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</a> to start the machine with a minimal set of services running, then try and reproduce the fault. If you don't see the same error code when running Windows Live Mail in
 clean-booted Windows, you will have established that the fault is caused by third-party software. By starting again with half of the previously-disabled services running, you should eventually be able to pinpoint the service that's causing the fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this troubleshooting doesn't locate the fault, test your Internet connection. For a start, reboot the modem. This is usually easily done by switching off power to it, waiting a minute or two and then switching it on again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<h2>            Windows time is always behind by 5 minute every time I restart</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This has been happening for a few days now, every single time I restart, the clock/time on my computer is always about 5 minutes behind. I have to resync with the internet time and that will fix it for the duration that I am on the computer. When I shut
 down/restart, this problem comes back again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have already tried registering/unregistering&nbsp;<span>w32tm and then restarting the service, however, this issue still persists after a restart.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Resetting the real-time clock didn't help, it's still about 4-5 minutes off every time I restart my computer. If I'm correct, it's probably the exact same number of seconds behind.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've check and there is no upgrade for the BIO available. I have run a virus scan with Norton and a malware scan with MBAM, nothing. I ran sfc /scannow and it didn't came up with any integrity violation. I ran&nbsp;dism and nothing came up neither, I even did
 restorehealth for good measure. Problem still persists.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't want to do a clean installation since this is such a small issue, however, this is baffling me. The only other thing I can think of is that something in the registry got corrupted or the CMOS battery is bad (though shouldn't that mess up more than
 just the time + why is the timing exactly 4-5 minutes...)</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The system clock of Windows operating systems is reading the time/date from the BIOS (BIOS is the program based on the CMOS structure). If the CMOS battery is leaking, it cannot remember the correct time after shutting down. Therefore, after restarting
 your computer, Windows reads the wrong time/date from the BIOS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods listed below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> Press the Windows Key +R to open the Run Window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>In the Run Window, type <b>services.msc
</b>and press enter.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Right click on <b>Windows Time</b>and select
<b>properties </b>to check the status of the service.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Restart the <b>Windows Time </b>service.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Click on OK.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span>Restart the computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:<br />
</b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Click on clock and select “Change date and time settings”.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Click on the “Internet Time” tab.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Check if it is set to “synchronize the time with time.windows.com”</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>If the option is selected, click on change settings to check the option “Synchronize with an Internet Time server”</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Click on OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>a.<span> Press the Windows Key +R to open the Run Window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.Type "CMD" in the Run Window </span></span></p>
<p>c.<span>Type each one of the command below and press enter.</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>net stop w32time</span></p>
<p><span>w32tm /unregister</span></p>
<p><span>w32tm /register</span></p>
<p><span>net start w32time</span></p>
<p><span>w32tm /resync</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to test the issue again.</span></p>
<p><span>W32tm.exe is used to configure Windows Time service settings. It can also be used to diagnose problems with the time service. W32tm.exe is the preferred command line tool for configuring, monitoring, or troubleshooting the Windows Time service.</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face any issues, you may need to replace CMOS battery</span></p>
<p><span>Please understand that improper modification on the BIOS/CMOS may prevent the computer from booting up properly; BIOS/CMOS issues should be supported by the motherboard manufacturer because the BIOS/CMOS on different motherboards may have different
 modification interfaces. Therefore I suggest you to refer to your motherboard manual about how to perform the related operations. You may also contact your computer vendor for further information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps!</span></p>

            Has Conexant decided to support your fax modem on Windows 10? If so, they can help you to get it working. On the other hand, if Conexant decided against supporting your fax modem on Windows 10, there's nothing that you or anyone else can do about it.

    <title>Photo Gallery - not seeing all my photos when opened up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donkistner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery - not seeing all my photos when opened up</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 and use Photo Gallery not Windows Live Photo Gallery</p>
<p>When I open a picture, on the top left, I can click "Edit, organize, or share"</p>
<p>When doing this, as I want to edit - (usually to crop or brighten a photo), it opens a new window of the Photo Gallery with file folders listed along the left and photos on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that I cannot find the photo that I was just in or it's folder in this program now to edit. It just shows certain ones. I've tried adding a folder and it appears that it does, but when I click out of the include a folder in the library section,
 the folder that I just added does not show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all of these files on a drive on my computer that I use in a folder where I keep all of the files/photos. I use to be able to see everything and edit any folder or photo but now I'm not seeing everything when I click from a photo to edit.</p>
<p>I did find that if copy the folder I'm in to the desktop or copy the individual photo to the desktop I am able to open it, click edit, organize or share and it opens Photo Gallery and it is there but any changes I make are only to the copied photo and not
 to the original file so I'm having to copy that back into my original file and replace the original with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why I'm all of a sudden having issues. I did try reinstalling Photo Gallery by downloading from Windows online, and it does it and says I've installed it, but that doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help? Are there patches or something that is causing this issue?</p>

            <p>Hi Don...</p>
<p>Photo Gallery is part of the Windows Live package these days...there have been various amendments over the years but if you downloaded it from Windows your version should be up to date. You could try running a repair on it by going to Control Panel - Programs
 - Uninstall a program, and click on 'Windows Essentials 2012' select 'Uninstall/Change' and you will get the option to 'Repair all Windows Essentials Programs' - run that (it will take several minutes) and see if anything has improved.</p>
<p>From what you are describing it sounds like this may be a navigation issue rather than a problem with Photo Gallery, but it won't hurt to run the repair anyway....Regards R.</p>

            Thanks. I did the repair, but still having the issue. Appreciate the response. I wonder if I should uninstall completely and then reinstall from online, but figured if I installed it from online then it would overwrite and leave me with the newest version.&nbsp;

            <p>Well it might be worth running the MS SFC tool from the link below... follow the onscreen instructions for W7 and it will report if anything is amiss system - wise. If that gives the all clear then it may be worth trying an uninstall and reinstall of PG

            Welcome Losteey,
<br />
<br />I'm Daniela, an independent advisor and I'm here to help you. I would recommend finding the age2.exe file by right clicking on it and going to properties. Under the Compatibility tab, set it to Windows XP Service Pack 3 and see if this fixes the problem.
<br />
<br />Running the .exe file as an administrator might also solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Daniela

<p>
</p><p><span>That is the Touch Keyboard showing up.&nbsp; It won't show up if you have the real On-Screen Keyboard running (osk.exe).&nbsp; So, you could start that, leave it minimized and never get the TK to show at all as long as the OSK was active.</span></p>
<p>

            This is an interesting work-around. It can be used while .osk is active. I think I will give this a try!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>What bluetooth software are you using?</p>
<p>A little suggestion about this problem. Did you try to go in your bluetooth options via the software you are actually using and put on your computers bluetooth visibility on and also accept incoming connections. Your bluetooth adaptor on your computer acts
 same as your mobile and sometimes you should configure it to make it work.</p>
<p>Hope this will help,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

 winderstat to find out what was taking up all my space. There are several files with strange characters (some have Chinese or Japanese characters some have Latin symbols some are just punctuation marks) that take up to as much as 8 gigs and everytime I make
 space on the drive a new file is created. Try to delete these files in winderstat and error message comes up says the file is in use. Try to find the files in explorer and they aren't there. I individually went through and checked every file folder in windows
 folder. Again nothing. &nbsp;So I think it is a virus. Run windows defender. Nothing. Boot in safe mode and run defender on just the windows folder and again nothing. I have run out of ideas and need help. Because there is no room on hard drive dealing with program
 crashes and slow choppy overall performance. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</span>

            <p>The best approach for a highly infected PC is a "Clean Install" as you can never be 100% certain<br />
that every last bit of the infections were removed.</p>
<p><br />
That said if you have the time and want to see just how far you can go in removing the viruses,
<br />
malware and bots then read on.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the free version of Malwarebytes, it will detect and remove most viruses.<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>Also there is Norton Power Eraser <br />
<a href="http://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.asp?lcid=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.asp?lcid=1033</a><br />
Note: Because the Norton Power Eraser uses aggressive methods to detect these threats,
<br />
there is a risk that it can select some legitimate programs for removal. <br />
You should use this tool very carefully, and only after you have exhausted other options.</p>
<p>Microsoft Safety Scanner<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. <br />
To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, <br />
download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p><br />
For me on a friends PC that had more than 60 infections, and he had no recovery CD and the keycode was lost, the above software 'Malware Bytes','AVG Free' and Norton's NIS 2010 did the trick.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 4 warranty seems to be incorrect, Answer Desk wants &#36;29</h2>
                    I was attempting to use the Answer Desk regarding a problem with my Surface Pro 4, only for it to tell me that my device was out of warranty and it would cost $29 to get help. The problem is that I was assured that my device would be covered for a YEAR,
 and the order for my current replacement was on 6/1/2016. According to the Answer Desk, my warranty expired 3/29/2017. Why did I not get the full year? Is there a way for this to be fixed so that I can get the help I need without the $29 fee?

<p>You're not missing anything. &nbsp;Microsoft did the same for me and added 3 extra month to my warranty giving me a total of 15 months. &nbsp;So in actuality you got 3 additional months free. &nbsp;Microsoft's written warranty is very clear,

<h2>            How to disassociate my email address from Windows Live&#63;</h2>
                    I have a problem. When I opened my Windows Live account I gave it an email address that I had on my own domain. That email address was being managed by the now defunct OLSB service from Microsoft which I have since migrated to Office 365.
<div><br />

<div>So the email address recorded in my Windows Live account is an email on my own domain that is managed by Office 365. How can I remove that email address from Windows Live or at least tell Windows Live that I want it to use another email address?</div>

            Ron, I can't create a new Windows Live ID as I have a lot of Groups, Skydrive data, primary contact list, calendars etc tied to it. I definitely have to keep it.
<div><br />
<div>The point I'm trying to make is that Office365 manages my email account which just happens to have the same ID as my Windows Live ID. In Live that email address is registered as the one associated with my Windows Live account. That was fine when I was
 using WLSB but now that I've migrated to Office 365 I want to remove that email address from Windows Live or at least change it to some other email address. That doesn't seem to be possible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So my question remains. How on earth do I get out of this situation and still retain the Windows Live ID I have had for many years.</div>

You can have as many Live IDs as you want - I have about a dozen. </p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand&nbsp;your problem. What can't you do now after the change to Office 365 that you could do before?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 does not allocate enough CPU slices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cls500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 does not allocate enough CPU slices</h2>
                    <p>I have a very CPU intensive application that I run on a Xeon E5-2670 CPU with 16 cores. The application crunches numbers and only needs 1 Gb of RAM. It is a 32-bit app with handcoded set of Intel SSE3 instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed on many occasions that the app is complaining that it does not get enough CPU slices from the OS (64-bit Windows 10) even though overall system utilization is around 40%. Changing the app baseline priority to Real Time makes zero difference
 and the app is starving for CPU slices. There is nothing else running on this computer (HP Z420 workstation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions where to start with troubleshooting? I have already change all system settings for maximum performance and they have not made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I could guide you too uninstall the video card drivers and reinstall, but you probably better off doing this first.

 </blockquote> <p><br /></p><p>There's a possibility to help narrow down the problem. When you said it made you wonder if it's the controllers... did you take a controller to his friend's house or just the headphones? Since the headphones seem to work there, you could take your son's controller and headphones (if you didn't before) to his friend's place and use them there for awhile. If it works, then you know it isn't the controller. If it still doesn't work, but it does work with his friend's controller, that pretty much narrows the problem down to your controller. </p>
