<h2>            Win 7 Cannot use photo folder as wallpaper slide-show</h2>
                    
<p>I did a clean install of Win 7 Home Premium Upgrade version. Then I installed Windows update. Now I cannot use my own pictures folder as wallpaper slide-show. When I browsed to the right pictures folder and selected it, it was reset back to "Windows Desktop
 Backgrounds", which was c:\windows\web\wallpapers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the SlideShow gadget also failed to work.</p>
<p>The Start Menu also refused to display "Pictures", "Videos" and "Music" as links, no matter how I toggled the their checkbox.</p>

<p><span>Hi Man-wai Chang,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any third party security software installed on the computer?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may put the computer in a clean boot state and check if any third party applications are causing this issue and check if
 you can change the wallpaper and if everything works fine. </span><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or
 in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual” and set it to Normal
 startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed any third party security software on the computer, you may also try to temporarily disable security software from
 the computer and try to check if everything works normally. If it works fine, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 3</span></strong></span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may access the link below and follow the steps to update display drivers on your computer and
 check if it helps. </span></p>

    <title>HDMI output not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ihate apple  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI output not working</h2>
                    About a year ago, I used to use an HDMI cable to connect my computer running Vista to my HDTV. Everything worked great. After a while (a few weeks), the HDMI sound stopped working, and the HDMI device disappeared from Sound. I never found an answer to
 the problem. Then I upgraded to Windows 7 and the problem persisted. After a little while longer, every time I connected to my TV, the image on the screen would turn yellow. So now neither sound or video is working correctly. I know it is the computer's issue
 because it is the same on both of my TVs. How can I fix this problem?

    <title>IGN Poll- Halo 4 vs. Black Ops 2. What do you think&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcfragpants  say:</h3>
<h2>            IGN Poll- Halo 4 vs. Black Ops 2. What do you think&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>IGN is having a cool poll to see what people think is better. I know there are some annoying threads about this specific versus topic but lets keep this to a friendly debate. I'm posting this in both forums as well and am interested to see what people think.
 Please keep it to legitimate opinions and arguments. Not just "HUR DUR (insert game) SUCKS". The poll is on graphics, multiplayer, and campaign.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/you-decide-halo-4-vs-call-of-duty-black-ops-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/you-decide-halo-4-vs-call-of-duty-black-ops-2</a>, it has instructions on how to vote. Real simple
 and you don't have to actually watch through every video.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Graphics- Definitely Halo 4. Cut scenes were great and I thought the opening one was live action at first. In game was still amazing too.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Campaign- Gotta give it to Black Ops. It actually got me playing through more than once. The different choices with different consequences were great. Halo was great and did a great job with the story but overall I enjoyed Black Ops more.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Multiplayer- Halo. Call of Duty has better replay value in my opinion, but there's too many issues with it. I like Halo better because I feel like it is balanced better and takes more skill. If Black Ops didn't have the problems with lag, spawns, and gun
 balance, then I might have picked it. I do sometimes find myself playing Call of Duty more but I think Halo has better quality multiplayer.</p>

<p>I play Black Ops 2 more, and I WILL play it more. I like it quite a bit more.</p>

<p>At the same time, Halo 4's probably the better game. It's a lot more of "Ohp. That was my fault." when you die in that game. The online aspect is put together MUCH better than BO2.</p>

<p>I hate when people say "it's not fair to compare them, they're so different." They're both first person shooters and they both came out within a month and that's more than enough similarities to compare them. Some people think games have to be identical
 to compare, but then what would be the point of comparing?</p>

 you wanted to. It's just a lot more difficult and preference-based.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I checked the imagepath of the service on the registry, and the file exists (both svchost and wlansvc.dll are working normally, the dll is registered too).&nbsp;<br />
The LocalService and NetworkService user profiles are active and functional, i see no reason to this message.<br />
<br />
When i try to start it through the command line, it doesn't start either, it states that the start is pending (state 2), and just after this, if i use 'sc query' to check it, it'll be stopped (state 1) and the exit codes are:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Win32_exit_code: &nbsp;0x3<br />
service_exit_code: 0x0<br />
<br />
<span>[EDIT]</span><br />
<span>[EDIT]</span><br />
<br />
<span>I just noted that event log service is also behaving like that, and the only thing in common between them is the image path: "%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted".</span><br />
<span>I just noted that event log service is also behaving like that, and the only thing in common between them is the image path: "%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted".</span><br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?<br />
<br />
Without this service i can't acess any wireless networks, i can't even acess some wireless options (for example, connect to a hidden wireless network), but the wired network is completely functional, i have no other problems.<br />
<br />
Obs.: For sure i tried the most basic options, as running the troubleshooter, but i don't even have the troubleshooter in this windows, it's an modified OS.

            I guess this is an automated response, because i clearly stated that i have already done most of those steps, specially trying to start the service manually (and I even provided the outputs).<br />
<br />
My problem right now is not with the wireless networks themselves, but with the wlansvc service, which refuses to work.<br />
<br />
This and some other processes are refusing to work and give me the same output, though that there's nothing wrong with the imagepath or with their associated files, everything is working and functional, but it still refuses to work, alleging that the system
 can't find the specified path (it doesn't inform me what path it can't find though, but all paths associated to those services on the registry are working)<br />
<br />
It must be some problem in the service management itself, or some common issue to those services, but i still can't find what common issue is that, the only thing in common is the imagepath, but there are other services with that imagepath that still work

                    <p>&lt;Original title: Use built in Nvidia card for everything&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased an ASUS Q552 laptop on 12/24/15. It uses an Intel Skylake i7 and has an NVidia GEFORCE 940M graphics card built in. When I right click on the desktop there is a significant delay before the display adjustment menu opens up. A
<strong>significant </strong>delay (I get the hourglass icon). I read that NVidia video drivers do not work well with Windows 10. My drivers are up to date. I disabled the Intel Integrated Graphics display adapter which
<strong>did </strong>solve the right click delay issue. However, upon opening my PC game, the frame rates dropped to 5 FPS. The laptop seemed to have defaulted to using the VERY basic Microsoft display adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't understand the point of have a solid, dedicated GPU like the NVidia 940M, if you can't set it as the default GPU. It seems the only option I have is to use the Intel graphics for my laptop display. It makes me think that when I play my game
 I'm using Intel graphics and not the NVidia GPU. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to force and <strong>verify</strong> that the NVidia 940M is being used for all graphics and video?</p>

            <p>This did not solve the issue. I tried setting the compatibility mode to both Window 7 and then Windows 8 and it would not let me run the executable. I think I was able to update the Nvidia driver but I still get a delay when right clicking on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display adapter for my laptop's <strong>display </strong>is the Intel Integrated HD Graphics. It seems that when running my computer game, the Nvidia graphics card takes over. My trouble is with the desktop.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I solved the problem. I had to remove the option to open the Intel Graphics control panel from the context menu. This is accomplished through an edit to the registry. I also removed the option to open the Nvidia control panel as well just to be sure though
 I'm 99.9% sure it was Intel causing the problem.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Windows  Upgrade Error Code 0xC19900101-0X20017,  The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase, with an error during the Boot operation.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satiellite Running on Windows 8.1 and have been trying, on and off, for several months to upgrade to MS Windows 10. After solving several other error codes, I can't get by this one without asking for help.&nbsp; Everything seems to update and
 load fine, but I consistantly get this error code and it reboots back to Windows 8.1. (Windows&nbsp; Upgrade Error Code 0xC19900101-0X20017,&nbsp; The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase, with an error during the Boot operation.)</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to solve this?</p>

<p>During "Copying files", we actually boot into a minimal version of Windows and copy important files and drivers from the old operating system into the new one. If we fail in this first stage you’ll see an error code in the Windows Update control panel called
 c1900101 x200xx. For example, 20017 means we couldn’t even boot into this operating system and usually points to bad storage drivers.

    <title>Calendar&#47;People app issue regarding &#39;ghost Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barbkevn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar&#47;People app issue regarding &#39;ghost Microsoft account&#39; &#38; &#39;UniversalOutlook&#39;</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Ignore first post, it is only emotionally&nbsp;ranting. Read on from second post, where I took my "chill pills".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For a while now I have an issue with a default entry named "Microsoft account" within Windows 10 Calendar/People, which does not show within Windows 10 Mail. This entry seems to be a ghost from who knows what, since the real Microsoft account I use for logging
 in is already accessible within those apps under a different name.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This ghost entry is nowhere to be found in Settings, so I have no idea how it got there. It does not seems to successfully synchronize events and contacts with an online account, so for me it is totally useless. I would really like to remove it, but sadly there
 is no obvious way to do that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After noticing the strange multiple "UniversalOutlook" entries within my account on https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/mobiledevice, that cannot be deleted and gives a big **** error. My suspicion rose this has to be a bug, and not an intentional feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the last few months I've spend days and hours trying to troubleshoot this issue myself, and with help from others. Among the things I've tried multiple times, in multiple sequences and multiple combinations are:<br />
<br />
- Running default Windows Troubleshooters<br />
- Removing mail accounts and restoring them<br />
- Switching back and forth between login with local and Microsoft account<br />
- Creating new users and user profiles<br />
- Removing Windows apps and restoring them (PowerShell/Store)<br />
- Clearing and deleting caches, stores and folders<br />
- Formatting and reinstalling a fresh Windows 10 instance<br />
<br />
But sadly no permanent solution was found. Some attempts where successfully in temporary fixing the problem. But after a while, or a couple reboots, that darn ghost entry just reappeared spontaneously.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
During my search for a solution, I found multiple people that reported the same, or very similar issues. And I firmly believe there are way more that are not publicly reporting this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've created, up voted, participated in multiple feedbacks on this hub, and threads on Microsoft Community, under this and other of my Microsoft accounts. I've even contacted support (Answer Desk) multiple times. But how friendly those support engineers may
 be, they only offered simple solutions that I've already tried myself. So still no fix so far.<br />
<br />
Even tough it has it flaws, I really like Windows 10, and the road Microsoft entered with it. But sadly I am left unsatisfied regarding this issue. There has been no official response from Microsoft. If you would not know better, it almost seems the are ignoring
 this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel unheard, ignored and left in the dark. Why does Microsoft gives no official response?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I usually disagree with spamming. But at this moment I really feel it is my last resort to drawing Microsofts attention. Since all my other efforts and attempts have been totally useless. Yes, I'm sorry, but I have to do this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So from now on, every time I open my Calendar/People, and I notice this darn persistent ghost entry, I will repost these requests. At least an acknowledgment or confirmation about this issue is an start. That will hopefully open a path to finding a real solution.
 I'm left with no other options.<br />
<br />
Added to these request, I will add multiple references from people reporting, or requesting information about, the same issue. Remember, I'm not the only one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again my apologies.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>For anyone who is following this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I had another chat session with Microsoft Support . I spoke with two very friendly people, one from Windows Tech Support, and one from Outlook.com Tech Support.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Windows Tech Support </strong><em>(Duration: ~1h)</em></p>
<p>After again explaining the whole ordeal, allot of questions--&gt;answer moment where happening, an bit by bit the Support Engineer understood what the problem was. We agreed to start a remote support session, so that it would me more easy for me to show him.
 Off course they tried the basic troubleshooting and reviewing my settings from within Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while the Support Engineer noted that he was not sure if he could fix this, and he suggested using the Feedback Hub and Microsoft Community. So I told him I've already done that a couple of times, and showed him the link to all the other people having
 the same problems. He told me there is not much he can do about it, but there perhaps still is a way he could help me. Since I also showed him the device entries on outlook.com, and the error that comes up when deleting it. He could explain the issue to a
 colleague from Outlook.com Tech Support, and connect me with them. I happily agreed, and we started the transition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Outlook.com Tech Support </strong><em>(Duration: ~2h)</em></p>
<p>The same process as with the Windows Tech Support was repeated. So another remote support session was started. This time there was more focus on the "UniversalOutlook" device entries. After a while and allot of trying, the focus changed again to the "Microsoft
 account" and also they where not able to solve it. At some point it took a turn, and I was told it was a feature so that I can use a local calendar that does not sync. I insisted it was not that way, and was remembering them of the "UniversalOutlook" inconsistency.</p>
<p>After some more troubleshooting she discussed it with another colleague. She told me she could transfer this to an Escalation Engineer, who could perhaps help me. The downside of it was, that only the "UniversalOutlook" was escalated, since they
 still believe the "Microsoft account" is a local calendar. But she also suggested that I myself should note the "Microsoft account" thing to the Escalation Engineer, and try to make him look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We started many recordings for gathering evidence of the issue, and also created HTTP traffic logs using Telerik Fiddler. After all that she explained to me the following actions shall happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Within 3-5 days from now, a Escalation Engineer will contact me on my provided phone number, withing the provided time fram</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">e. No further information is know about the
 handeling of the issue itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even tough the problem itself is not solved yet, I am still happier then I was before. Hopefully the Escalation Engineer will notice this is a bigger problem then just a simple setting, and perhaps getting a opening for solving this problem for us all. Even
 tough the regulair Support Engineers I spoke where not able to solve this, they at least transferred the issue to someone else. Thank you again, I finally have the feeling this issue might be taken serious!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep you up to date in this thread. So if there is more information known, or I had contact with another Microsoft person, I will post it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time I really recommend all of you, by doing the same. Please contact Microsoft Support (https://support.microsoft.com/ --&gt; Contact us), and explain this issue as many times needed, showing them with a remote support session really is the easiest
 way. If they are not able to solve it stay friendly and constructive, but meanwhile insist you want to escalate. I believe if we can do this collectively, we can draw
<em>Uncle Bill's</em> attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a constructive addition, or had a support session about this. Please post it here. The bigger we are, the harder to ignore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading this. </p>

            <p>Hi Barbkevn. I believe the Support Engineers are right---it does appear that the "Microsoft account" calendar is a local account calendar.&nbsp; And I think
<em>it is only created when the Mail or Calendar app is opened</em> <em>before email accounts are fully setup in the Windows 10 settings</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to replicate/confirm the last part when resetting two computers yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Computer #1, after resetting I immediately went to Windows 10 Settings-&gt;Email &amp; app accounts-&gt;selected the email account that's my Microsoft account (felixwong.com domain) and clicked Manage-&gt;Change mailbox sync settings-&gt;Turn on email sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Only afterward</em> did I first open up the Mail and Calendar apps.&nbsp; No "Microsoft Account"&nbsp;was listed in Calendar:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e3d4947-7b80-45fb-a3ac-68a39f6d256c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e3d4947-7b80-45fb-a3ac-68a39f6d256c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On Computer #2, after resetting, I opened up the Mail app.&nbsp; (I didn't look at the Calendar, but I'd bet if I did open it, "Microsoft account" would be listed.)&nbsp; And then I went into Windows 10 Settings-&gt;Email &amp; app accounts-&gt;selected the email account that's
 my Microsoft account (felixwong.com domain) and clicked Manage-&gt;Change mailbox sync settings-&gt;Turn on email sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that on that computer, I have both a "Microsoft account" listed and a "felixwong.com" account listed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/791a4ab8-ebbb-4777-bbb1-d3f3d9a13974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/791a4ab8-ebbb-4777-bbb1-d3f3d9a13974" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Events added to the "Microsoft account" calendar do not sync to Outlook.com (logged in with my Microsoft account credentials, which is the email with the felixwong.com domain).&nbsp; So I believe it truly is a local calendar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also cause Computer #1 to have the "Microsoft account" calendar created/listed by simply&nbsp;deleting my felixwong.com email account in either the Windows 10 settings or the Mail app.&nbsp; It sort of makes sense the "Microsoft account" would be listed/created:
 no cloud accounts now are associated with the Calendar, so there needs to be some sort of local calendar in the event you wanted to add events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, even after cloud email accounts are set up again in Windows, there doesn't seem to be a way to get rid that "Microsoft account" calendar from the Calendar app except to reset the computer and set it up in the manner I did with Computer #1
 above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until someone discovers a way to delete the calendar--or Microsoft implements a way--I'd suggest that you un-expand "Microsoft account" so it is not listing "Calendar" underneath it, to keep it as minimal and un-distracting as possible.&nbsp; I.e., ignore it
 the best you can.&nbsp; Ultimately, while having this unused local calendar listed looks "unclean," it is a minor issue that causes no problems with functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, Microsoft would mitigate this issue by doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow deletion of "Microsoft account" calendar when a cloud-connect account is added.</li><li>Don't call it "Microsoft account" in the first place.&nbsp; Call it something like "Local account."&nbsp; This would go a long ways in reducing the confusion it's caused, as the name causes many people to think that this calendar gets sync'd to their Microsoft account
 calendars in the cloud.</li></ul>

</p><p>Thanks for troubleshooting and posting! I was looking in the same direction as you did, but you confirmed some doubts I had. With the information you provided, I've been investigating further.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Initially no 'ghost calendar'.</p>
<em>Computer #1 </em>. And yes indeed, no 'ghost calendar'! After a while (hours/reboots) when opening the Windows 10 Mail app, a message appears:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"You're the first. We're rolling out updates starting with @outlook.com. Your account now has a new, focused inbox, faster search. And much more."</span></p>

</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span>Registry keys and values.</span></p>
<em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ActiveSync.&nbsp;</em>Lets take a look at the differences here as well.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Without 'ghost calendar' (before new features message)</strong></p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span>Reverting changes from new features introduction.</span></p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">The automatically added account works within the Windows 10 Mail/Calendar app, and there is no 'ghost calendar' anymore! Also the new introduced features are missing, so yeah you can guess what will happend next. After a while the
 whole process starts over again. The feature message is displayed, and behold the 'ghost calendar' is again to be found.</p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span>Conclusion and follow-up.</span></p>
 introduction of new features. I can not believe this is all intentionally. Like you stated yourself, why name a local calendar
<em>Microsoft account</em> on a machine with internet connection that uses a Windows Login Microsoft Account? But since Microsoft had stated&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no official explanation&nbsp;yet</span><em>,&nbsp;</em>I can only guess.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've also found some more information about strange behavior and devices on&nbsp;<em>Outlook.com</em>. If I can make up the time, I will try to make a post about it in two days. I'll also be waiting for the Microsoft Escalation Engineer
 to contact me.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">In the meantime, I hope you could check some things out. If you have the time and energy to do so, with all the information provided above. I wonder if on your systems you have the same differences between your situations. I am
 especially curious if your registry keys and values are different from mine. Everyone reading here is welcome to do the same. I could use some information for comparison.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you all in advance, I will keep you posted.</p>

            <p>Nice detective work, barbkevn. Your post is the first I've seen that actually shows a way (regedit) to remove the "ghost" Microsoft account--albeit only temporarily before Outlook updates--without resorting to a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I noticed the email account's icon change (from Outlook icon to generic envelope icon) when the ghost account appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, on my Windows 10 Mobile phone (Lumia 640 XL), I cannot make the Calendar app get a "ghost" account using the method I described in my first post for Computer #2.&nbsp; And the icon for my felixwong.com email account is the Outlook icon.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm not going mad!&nbsp; I just found this thread and thank goodness.&nbsp; I've been having this problem, exact same issues with ghost account in the Calendar, and cannot fix it.&nbsp; I have reinstalled Windows 10, system restored, uninstalled and reinstalled the app
 (multiple times), got Tech to remote in to my desktop, reset the app etc etc.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; I always get the ghost account appearing after using the app, and most annoyingly as soon as the ghost account appears you cannot change the default reminder time
 for appointments.&nbsp; You can set it to 30 minutes - on reopening the item it's defaulted back to 15 minutes.&nbsp; And, when you click on the agenda on the task bar calendar colours do not show as they are on the calendar and the birthday calendar disappears.&nbsp; What
 is going on Microsoft?&nbsp; I have no solutions just endless annoyance and time wasted.&nbsp; Two further matters of interest.&nbsp; This problem only appears for me&nbsp;on a Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; I also use an older Surface Pro 3. No problems on that machine.&nbsp; Why the difference?
 Second point.&nbsp; According to the Microsoft Tech my account isn't set up to have a focused inbox. That's true for the Outlook web app, and for Outlook 2016.&nbsp; However, it appears on the Mail app.&nbsp; My solution?&nbsp; Uninstall the Mail and Calendar app, and use only
 Outlook 2016 for email and a third party live tile app for Calendar.&nbsp; Can somebody at Microsoft please work this out?

            <span>And I would add that the only simple way to not have a wacky name for the user account folder (for example David_2893xxxx) when you reinstall Windows 10, is
 to create first a local account (with the name of his choice) and then go into the settings and select email and accounts, scroll to the bottom of the page and under email, calendar, and contacts, add your Microsoft account to sign in to all Microsoft apps.
 But… it also creates this issue in the calendar app : a ghost account</span>

            <p>@barbkevn Thanks for your effort. Your Tech help seemed better than mine. He just clicked several times on delete of those UniversalOutlook accounts, opened and closed a hundred times the chat window (??), did sfc /scannow and deleted my temp folders...
 At the end he gave me a reference number and that's it. A wasted hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now trying to ignore this "feature" as far as possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>@FelixWong_ I think they have no clue or they lied to you. If it's an intended local calendar it would not be named as a "Microsoft account". Better name would be "local account" or something since Microsoft account always references to the cloud. Also it
 would appear everywhere and would have a setting maybe. </p>
<p>

<p>Is this actually another Outlook.com upgrade or is this still the one which happened one year ago?</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I've been silent in this thread, and I lacked with keeping you guys informed. But in the mean time allot has happend. It is to much to tell in detail, but I will give a short summery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had multiple contact moments with Microsoft Support. At one moment there was an "Support Escalation Engineer: Technical and UR T3"(<em>Sandeep</em>) handeling my case. It was a very friendly and polite person, who spared no time trying to help me. He
 was open for suggestions, and I got the feeling the took the information, we as a community gathered ourselves, very seriously.&nbsp;Around every three days he called me, and with a remote support session tried to troubleshoot further, or gathered more information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There where multiple tools involved, and eventually he managed to remove the "UniversalOutlook" device entries on Outlook.com. But that not seemed to fix the issue regarding 'ghost Microsoft account' calendar entry. In hindsight, it almost seems as if the
 "UniversalOutlook" device was the proper connection Windows 10 Calendar should have used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the times he forwarded the gathered information to a different team, that is more involved in the design and development. They eventually confirmed the situation, and acknowledged it was the result of features that are being enrolled in batches.
 That is why not everyone has noticed it, and lately bit by bit more people are reporting in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They further investigated, and searched for a possible solution or work-around. In the meantime&nbsp;<em>Sandeep</em> kept me informed, and gave me a status update whenever possible. And now it seems to have paid of.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I received an update trough the Windows Store, of the Mail and Calendar application.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4ffe31e-2408-4ddb-99f6-995561ae4ede" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4ffe31e-2408-4ddb-99f6-995561ae4ede" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And behold, no more empty useless non-synchronising 'Microsoft account' calendar entry. WOOHOOO!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cd2df8d-58fd-4f1e-8761-b419269cea02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cd2df8d-58fd-4f1e-8761-b419269cea02" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><em>Sandeep</em> has closed my issue on Microsoft Support, and I will mark this thread solved also. Kudos to
<em>Sandeep</em>, who was able to follow my rambling and stood with me every time!!! (<strong>Bill Gates if you're reading this, give this man a raise :)</strong> )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thank you @FelixWong_, @BellaD 10, @Col Writer, @David Co., @Matt-17 for replaying/contributing/sharing information. I hope the problem is solved on your devices and accounts as well.</p>

<h2>            Installing a Dell Photo Printer 720</h2>
                    Windows is telling me that my Dell Photo Printer 720 does not have a driver. How do I install one? I have the original disc that came with the printer. Thanks

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this 32 bit or 64 bit Operating System?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have drivers disc for Dell Photo printer 720?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span>Dell Photo Printer is not compatible with Windows 7 Operating System?</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the suggested link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=%20dell%20photo%20printer%20720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=%20dell%20photo%20printer%20720</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>However, we can install the Dell Photo Printer 720 in Compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>First, let's make sure your computer has the latest Windows Updates, especially .net framework is installed.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Method 1:</b> Disconnect the printer. Download and run the patch(printer cleanup utility) until it prompts you to restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the below article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/DriverDetails/DriverFileFormats?DriverId=R166313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/DriverDetails/DriverFileFormats?DriverId=R166313</a>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Manual Printer Driver Removal</span></b><b><span>:<br />
</span></b><span>You remove the Printer manually </span><span>start&gt;control panel&gt;Hardware and sound&gt;View Devices and Printers&gt;Right click on your printer&gt;Left click remove device</span><span>
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> If you have Windows 7 32-bit, then download the Vista 32-bit drivers. If you have Windows 7 64-bit, then download
 the Vista 64-bit drivers. </span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the issue still persists, I also&nbsp;recommend that you contact the maker of that hardware device and inquire about future driver support for Windows
 7.</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot print &#40;or ping&#41; over wireless network to our network printer</h2>
                    We have a HP laptop running Windows 7 that cannot ping or print to our wireless printer.&nbsp; Strangely enough it works fine when I plugin the ethernet cable to the laptop.&nbsp; We have two mac's that print wirelessly with no issue.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p>You could also ask if the printer is open to communications from other computers why would it be blocking your laptop unless there is a problem with the laptop's wireless configuration?&nbsp;You know that the&nbsp;Windows printer drivers and basic networking are OK
 because the laptop prints when you connect via ethernet. Getting rid of any potential obstacles to wireless&nbsp;communications (ie. firewalls, some anti-malware software)&nbsp;is the first step towards troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<p>Is the laptop using the same wireless standard as the printer ( 802.11 b/g ) or is it locked into 802.11n? The printer can be configured for Ad Hoc or Infrastructure mode. One routes communications direct to the wireless computers the other routes wireless
 communications through your router. Are the laptop wireless connection and printer operating in&nbsp;the same subnet?&nbsp;What are the wireless IPs of the laptop and printer?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - No usable drives found. Cannot backup</h2>
                    <p><span>I am using an HP laptop with Windows 10. I have a Seagate 2 TB external hard drive that is working perfectly in every way except that I can’t use it for backup. I can use it for third party backup
 programs, but not Windows 10 backup. When I try, I get a message that no usable drives a can be found. I have Googled the problem and found many solutions, most for Windows 8.1, and tried what I could. Nothing worked. I don’t want to tamper with the registry
 some solutions suggested. Can anyone help a non-technical guy to find a way to fix the problem?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>My Seagate 2TB Ext drive was OK with Windows 7,&nbsp;but after the upgrade to Windows 10,&nbsp;although it&nbsp;shows up in the taskbar, storage etc. and&nbsp;I can even Drag and Drop files into it,&nbsp;I cannot use it to backup Windows 10 as it is not seen in the File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like yourself I have tried all suggestions on this site and the web. They haven't helped.</p>

            <p>Just a thought.&nbsp; The File History On/Off Toggle Switch will be greyed out if the system can't find an available&nbsp;drive that can be used for File History Backups. So, is the external drive 'clean'&nbsp;of other content, or are you already&nbsp;using it for another purpose?&nbsp;
 To use File History, the Drive has to be dedicated to that sole purpose.&nbsp; You can, of course, partition large drives and use one of the partitions, by Drive Letter, as a File History Drive.

<h2>            Asking about warranty on my new Xbox One X</h2>
                    I just bought a new Xbox One X a couple days ago. When I check on the warranty info on xbox site, it says that the manufacturer warranty ends 12/23/2020, but i did not buy the Xbox in december, I bought it in januari. And the technical support ends&nbsp;<br />
03/23/2019. Is that right, or did i buy a already selled one? Cause i bought it from Elgiganten, they are like the biggest sellers of tech in my country so it feels weird if they sells a already selled one.

    <title>Windows 10 Professional upgraded itself &#40;for no reason&#41; to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanfantus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Professional upgraded itself &#40;for no reason&#41; to Enterprise and now it&#39;s deactivated and I can&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgrade a fresh Windows 10 Home installation to a Windows 10 Professional through the Microsoft store digital upgrade. Everything went fine, paid the $99 and was able to use my computer as expected. However earlier today I booted my computer and
 the "Activate Windows" watermark is present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to activate windows, it gives me an error 0xC004F213. If I run the troubleshooter, it says that it can't fix the problem. I tried clicking the "I changed hardware on this device recently" link and then saw my Microsoft Account application pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option here is to "Go to store" which I clicked. This opens the Microsoft Store application and immediately lands on a screen that says "We're not sure how you got here, but you can't buy this version of Windows 10." It gives an error code of 0x8000FFFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is that I have a valid key for home and professional, but not for enterprise. I don't&nbsp;<em>want</em> enterprise, and didn't pay for that. I just want the professional edition that I paid for to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist, thanks! This is driving me crazy trying to troubleshoot. Again, I didn't do anything to upgrade to enterprise edition - it did that by itself for no reason.</p>

            I can, to the best of my ability, but it won't be of much help. Basically the tech remoted into my desktop and used a different activation code for Windows which reverted it to Pro.

====================================================<br />
<br />
You may need to thoroughly check the hard drive for errors (be sure to inspect the cable as best you can).<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for RootKits which can survive a format and installation of Windows.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN - it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or
 not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</span></a><br />
<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
After checking the drive for RootKits inspect the drive and cabling. Then thoroughly<br />
check the hard drive for errors using the <strong>Advanced Methods</strong> and the<strong> Manufactuter's&nbsp; Diagnostic Utilities</strong>.<br />
<br />
These are much more efficient methods to check the disk. <strong>&lt;- Advanced&nbsp;Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the&nbsp;Windows 10 disk (boot from it) :<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
(Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before / )<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
(Space after c and before / )<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
=====================================<br />
<br />
For even&nbsp;more thorough&nbsp;checking&nbsp;: <strong>&lt;-- Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities.</strong>
</p>
<p>(The old 302602 links is not valid now for the diagnostic links.)</p>
<p>Diagnostic Utilities By Manufacturer - run the one for your hard drive<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As you have found a Refresh or Reset will not work unless this error has been corrected. And you may still need to do a clean install. Since the issue is with the hard drive that needs to be fixed before anything else.<br />
