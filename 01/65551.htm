<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker shuts down my computer when &#34;preparing&#34; video</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Movie Maker issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Other</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I have tried several times to put together several different videos to burn a DVD.&nbsp; The videos total about 30 min.&nbsp; The "preparing" video comes up in the bottom left hand corner.&nbsp; I have waited 5-10 min. before but&nbsp;then&nbsp;I leave the room and when I come back
 my computer is shut down completely.&nbsp; It has happened the last 5 or 6 times that I have tried to work with video editing.&nbsp; I have plenty of available memory, I read that on here that could be a problem, but it shouldn't be my problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't know what version Windows Live Movie Maker that I have.&nbsp; Computer was bought in April 2009.<br />

<p><span>Hi
<span>tigertail02,<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>This might be due to one of the following causes:<br />
<br />
</span><span>-Older Windows Live Movie Maker version<br />
</span><span>-System resources<br />
</span><span>-Unsupported media files<br />
</span><span>-Missing or incorrect Video/Audio codecs<br />
</span><span>-Outdated VGA card driver<br />
<br />
</span><span>Please refer to the steps below for further assistance.<br />
<br />
1. </span><b><span>Older Windows Live Movie Maker version -
</span></b><span>Ensure you have installed the latest version under:
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker</strong></a>.
<br />
<br />
-</span><span>The current 2011 version:
<span>15.4.3538.513<br />
-</span></span><span>The current 2009 version recommended for Windows XP users only:
<span>14.0.8117.416<br />
<br />
</span>2.<strong> System resources - </strong></span><span>The more you add to Windows Live Movie Maker the more memory the application uses especially if you have a large video.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>To check how much Windows Live Movie Maker is using from your system, please go to your Task Manager, click on Processes tab and from there you can see if it's using more memory.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</span><span>If your virtual memory is low, there are two things that you can do. Increase the minimum size of your paging file and Split the video in two parts.<br />
<br />
A.<strong> Increase the minimum size of your paging file. </strong></span><span>Below are the steps on how to do so:<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Open System by clicking the
<b>Start </b>button, clicking <b>Control Pane</b>l, clicking <b>System and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking
<b>System</b>.<br />
b. </span><span>In the left pane, click
<b>Advanced system settings</b>.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
c. </span><span>On the <b>
Advanced</b> tab, under <b>Performance</b>, click <b>Settings</b>.<br />
d. </span><span>Click the
<b>Advanced</b> tab, and then, under <b>Virtual</b> memory, click <b>Change</b>.<br />
e. </span><span>Clear the
<b>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</b> check box.<br />
f. </span><span>Under <b>
Drive [Volume Label],</b> click the drive that contains the paging file you want to change.<br />
g. </span><span>Click <b>
Custom size</b>, type a new size in megabytes in the<b> Initial size (MB)</b> or <b>
Maximum size</b> <b>(MB</b>) box, click <b>Set</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Increases in size usually don't require a restart, but if you decrease the size, you'll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. We recommend that you don't disable or delete the paging file.<br />
<br />
B.<strong> SPLIT THE VIDEO - </strong></span><span>If you have a large video the best thing to do is to split the Video into smaller parts. This will help Windows Live Movie Maker deal with resources.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Click the
<b>video</b>, and then drag the playback indicator to the point where you want to split the video.
<br />
b. </span><span>Under <b>Video Tools</b>, on the Edit tab, in the Editing group, <strong>
click Split.<br />
<br />
</strong>3.<strong> Unsupported media files </strong></span><span>– Windows Live Movie Maker isn't compatible with a lot of formats it. Check if file types are supported by Windows Live Movie Maker
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</strong></a><br />
</span><span><br />
4. <strong>Missing or incorrect Video/Audio codecs</strong> - Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.
<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Media info</span></b><span>
<span>will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and
</span>whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;
<span>http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en <br />
<br />
</span></span><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to AVI and then
 import it in to Windows Live Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
5. </span><b><span>Outdated VGA card driver -
</span></b><span>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). Computers with video cards that are not intended for high-end graphics usage or older cards may encounter
 issues in rendering video and effects in Movie Maker.&nbsp; The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and quality.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>There are 2 ways how to determine the version and VGA card driver date to determine if it should be updated.<br />
<br />
<strong>Control Panel<br />
<br />
</strong>1. </span><span>Click on Start button and type Device Manager in Search programs and files box.<br />
2. </span><span>Click Device Manager on top of the results list.<br />
3. </span><span>Look for Display Adapter and click the triangle/chevron next to it.<br />
4.</span><span>&nbsp;It should show the name of you display adapter/video card. Right click on it and left click on properties.<br />
5. </span><span>Click the Driver tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note:</strong> You may also run the update from here. On the Driver tab, click the Update Driver button and on the new window click Search automatically for updated driver software.<br />
<br />
<strong>MS Diag/DirectX Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
</strong>1.<strong> </strong></span><span>Click on Start button and type dxdiag in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
2. </span><span>Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 10. Buzzing sounds glitch in during audio, and then eventually BSOD.</h2>
                    <p>I never know how long I have to use my computer once the glitch-buzzing starts, sometimes it's hours, sometimes it's minutes. I cannot figure out how to make this on command. I did an intensive series of virus scans, upgraded drivers, everything I could
 think of last time this happened about 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has started again. I don't know what to do anymore. I thought I had solved it before. I do not know how to look into the crash file though. I tried to do that last time and gave up and hadn't had the problem since.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to look into the crash file? I got stuck trying to figure out how to download symbols to read it properly.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This issue has been around for at least 5 months and microsoft has not fixed it. &nbsp;None of the suggested remedies from the other thread ( http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-very-brief-audio/7732139b-93ca-48fb-a942-0e069c79d1e5
 ) has fixed the problem. &nbsp;It appears to be a Microsoft 10 issue. &nbsp;Unistalling Windows 10 and going back to older versions seems to be the only fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft ever escalate this issue and get it fixed.</p>

            Got rid of the buzzing on Windows 10 audio playback by connecting with ethernet rather than wireless.

            This didn't work for me, but as i responded elswehere here i did discover a solution: i needed to install the most recent driver from realtek's page (the problem was from the combined sound/ethernet board). After that i had zero problems.&nbsp;

            Windows driver update didn't get the most recent realtek driver at the time I read this, but since then i manually installed the most recent realtek windows 8 driver and that solved my problem on windows 10. I don't know if it will work for everyone but
 it worked for me.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong>

<strong>&lt;- read this link<br />
</strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<h2>            wmplayer.exe bad image</h2>
                    Windows Media Player errors each time it is initialized. "Media Player is not installed properly and must be reinstalled..." This happened after a security update crashed my PC a number of times. I initially had to use my Windows 7 Repair Disk twice to
 recover the OS, now it seems that some core files are corrupted or missing? I have been through your forums and tried to reinstall Windows Media Player. Each time I attempt to install it errors telling me either my windows is not valid (It verifies for me
 to download the exe) or that my Media Player version is higher then the one installing ( I also attempted to install 11 since there was only 12 for Windows N editions) Mine is Windows 7 Ultimate. I am noticing that the Security updates are still failing Windows
 Firewall will not function, and so have run full scans of the computer with Windows Security Essentials and Spybot S&amp;D.

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade. ipod will not sync with iTunes</h2>
                    <p>:Yesterday I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; The upgrade went smoothly until I attempted to sync my ipod with iTunes.&nbsp; It synced just fine with 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will NOT sync with iTunes in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 8 hours going between 4 MS techs and two Apple techs to try every step possible to get my ipod nano 5th generation device to sync with iTunes.&nbsp; This includes:</p>
<p>1. My laptop is a new totally powerful Toshiba, no limitations with the computer.&nbsp; All drivers were checked to be current / best.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Diagnostics in Windows for Apple devices gone through and reset as suggested.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; iTunes was uninstalled and reinstalled.&nbsp; All Apple fixes possible were attempted.&nbsp; Ipod reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4th&nbsp;MS tech now agrees I need to&nbsp;DUMP 10 and return to 8.1 !&nbsp; Can you believe this!&nbsp; MS - get to work on fixing this bug!&nbsp; Thousands need help!</p>

    <title>Gamerscore Has Been Decreased - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marshman25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamerscore Has Been Decreased</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys and gals. I noticed today that my Gamerscore had decreased my 675 points. This is how I noticed the issue: Using my Xbox 360 console I signed into my account and on the dashboard under the Social hub I saw my account's Gamerscore. The number that
 had appeared was 15525. I then clicked "A" on my Avatar, went to the right once and to the right of Gamerscore I saw that my it was at 14850. I then proceeded to download my account. After synchronization my Gamerscore under the Social hub now shows as 14850.</p>
<p>I believe that I may have earned the 675 Gamerscore offline, but I wanted to get a second opinion. I do not have any account warnings or account violations. Furthermore, using xbox.com I am able to sign in to my account and within my Profile page I do not
 see a message that my Gamerscore has been reset.</p>
<p>Hopefully I am in the right place to ask!</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-Marshman25</p>

<p>Hi StrategicMisfit,</p>
<p>Yeah, your right. I have earned Gamerscore on the Xbox One. Earning an achievement while using the Xbox 360 provides a fix, although a temporary one.</p>
<p>The appearance of lower Gamerscore is still found after clicking "A" on my Avatar from the Social Hub and going to the Right once. This is the secondary location of Gamerscore on the Xbox 360 console. After earning an achievement the Gamerscore that displays
 in this location is lower than the one shown next to my Avatar within the Social Hub.</p>
<p>Additionally, downloading the Gamertag using the Xbox 360 will cause the Gamerscore found next to my Avatar within the Social Hub to appear as the lower value as found in the Gamerscore's secondary location.</p>
<p>Let me know if the same issue occurs on your end too.</p>

<h2>            Unable to change Sway settings to default IE or Firefox browser on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Can Sway setting be changed to default to IE11 instead of Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company has a corporate network that does not seem to get along with Edge and won't allow me to log into my account to start the Sway app on my surface. I have issues with Edge when trying to link to attachments or embedded links in outlook that require
 me to copy the URL manually into Firefox or IE 11 to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried setting my default browser to firefox but can get passed the log in to account to start sway.</p>

                    I cannot get my laptop to boot up. The Dell startup screen appears, then the Windows XP screen with the moving bar appears, then a blue screen flashes and then it turns off and immediately restarts. It just does this over and over. All external devices
 have been removed. If I go into the Windows Advanced Options Menu and select&nbsp; - Disable automatic restart on system failure, it tries to boot as above but stops on the blue error screen with the message&nbsp; - STOP: c0000145 {application error} The application
 failed to initialize properly (0xc0000005). Click on OK to terminate the application.<br />
It will not boot up in safe mode, or on Last Known Good Configuration. I put the Dell supplied operating system in the drive and boot from the disk and run the repair feature. It completes this task but still will not boot up.
<br />
What can I do? Any ideas? Thanks. Obviously I am using another PC to post this question.

            might i express that you might have a bad hard drive. i would run a scan of the hard drive from within windows and see if it comes up bad. it sounds like that could be the problem...other issues to perhaps try before then is to disable the cd or dvd drive
 you have installed and see if that solves the problem. but i would strongly recommend checking the hard drive out.

                    <p>after the last update&nbsp; &nbsp;the screen lost a lot of contrast, characters rather gray, top of explorer window white. Folder icons are pale yellow.I tried to run the color calibration but I get the message&nbsp; "..can't calibrate...the selected display because the
 display is "mirrored" ...duplicated".</p>
<p>It is a HP Omni 27 PC, no additional screen plugged. I searched "mirrored" "duplicated" in the settings but it doesn't exist (why?!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea to get back to a usable screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way why don't you let people sleep and spare electricity during the night?</p>
<p>Why aren't you able to respect the settings (like "pin to quick access")&nbsp; choosen by the user (they must be in a file)?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Lost all files after doing a system recovery. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost all files after doing a system recovery.</h2>
                    I got a virus on my computer and stupidly did a whole system recovery before backing up my files. Now I have lost everything, including 2 years of college course documents and 4 years of pictures. I have an HP dv6700 laptop. I brought it to a local tech
 support shop but after putting my drive into a recovery workstation the work station couldn't recognize the drive. In the notes I was given when I went to pick up my computer they mentioned "Partition blown up." &nbsp;after "Try file scavenger to recover data but
 again cannot recognize drive partition". &nbsp;I don't speak tech so can someone translate? My main question is, is all hope lost in recovering my files? And is there anything else I can try?&nbsp;

 along with an assessment of their recovery potential, a preview option and a hex viewer to inspect the content. You can limit your search to files of a certain type (e.g images, audio etc.) and choose between a fast and a deep scan approach. The program also
 includes a secure deletion option that allows you to permanently delete files that were found during the scan, in order to prevent any future recoveries.<br />

    <title>Multiple Bugs in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Bugs in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Multiple Bugs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,<br />
so after the windows 10 release i was keen to jump on and take a look so i downloaded the update as soon as possible.<br />
after the update, i quickly noticed many bugs and issues with the OS but that was to be expected after release. I waited a while for new updates and updated as often as possible. not only these bugs persisted, but they got worse.<br />
essentially, my computer now struggles with simple tasks such as opening folder explorer and maximizing full screen windows such as games.&nbsp;<br />
The main bugs are as follows;<br />
</p>
<p>1. windows randomly minimizes all windows, and the task bar as well as desktop items are not visible, followed by a flicker of the screen then everything refreshes back to the way it was (notably slowly) and all windows that were open remain expect default
 window programs such as folder explorer, mail and even word documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. random minimizations of full screen programs as well as having to attempt to reopen minimized full screen programs multiple times (this usually takes around 30 seconds of constant clicking on the window and using alt+shift+Tab to re-open)</p>
<p>3. incompatible programs for pretty much every program that inst affiliated with windows, such as steam, adobe programs and sometimes even google chrome. I have to run compatibility trouble shooter multiple times until the program functions properly and
 consistently give admin permission to almost every program.</p>
<p>4. random screen flickering coupled with a what to seems to be an infinite amount of program windows opening on the task bar (without any actually opening) and causing my cursor to be fixed into the centre of the screen as well as not being able to proceed
 with anything. I am only able to stop this when it happens by pressing the windows key to bring up the start menu. This sometimes also causes windows only programs to crash.</p>
<p>5. When booting up, my computer screen doesnt respond, staying black. Unless i restart the computer. This happens on every bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as these bugs are the main ones, there are still a few small inconsistent ones that surface every now and then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only posting this now as i was hoping for some sort of update or troubleshooting I could do but after searching through forums, its seems i may be the only one with these issues. I have checked for malware manually, with malware and anti-virus programs
 and even had multiple Microsoft representatives search through my computer via virtual accesses but nothing was found and they were unable to assist me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask for you to assist me in fixing these issues as the making working on my computer difficult and consistently interrupts my leisure gaming time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(UPDATED)</p>

            What you are referring to are not "bugs."&nbsp; Bugs are coding errors that are generally reproducible in different machines.&nbsp; You have a local problem which will probably best remedied by backing up your data and doing a clean installation of Windows 10 using
 the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>. &nbsp; Note that this will have no effect on program compatibility issues.&nbsp; You also need to make sure that your motherboard drivers are compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; The best source of information for this is the PC or motherboard manufacturer.<br />

<h2>            My Xbox One S shuts down when playing any games off of a disc. Please help&#63; &#40;Not due to overheating&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very recent issue that I've come across. I tried to play Overwatch and my Xbox froze, shutting down completely. The controller was still connected and I couldn't use it to turn my Xbox back on. I tried it again, and it worked however after leaving
 the game, watching youtube for a bit and then going back to Overwatch, it made some glitched sounds and shut down once again. It's happened with WW2 also. Luckily it hasn't booted down during a game but I'd still want this issue to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting the console, I've blown away any dust and it is also not overheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what's happening and will I need to get this fixed?</p>

            Darn.&nbsp; Ok, I've run a search and found a fix on the TechNet board that might help you.&nbsp; See http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproui/thread/9ee6ecdf-5958-4af4-b640-c659ada57bc4 We have already tried the first option so download Linda Yan's
 Folder Fix and follow the instructions.&nbsp; Hopefully this will do the trick.
