<h2>            Projecting Windows 10 to LG Smart TV not working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to project my Windows 10 (on a Lenovo ideapad 305) to a LG Smart Tv.</p>
<p>I have read all the advice on various sites and used the Screen Share app on the TV and gone onto the Project options on the action centre. I have checked all the settings on Advanced Sharing options and the LGwebOS is allowed in the windows media streaming
 options. But still it doesn't show up on the available devices. Please help … most frustrated</p>

            I'm also looking to record audio from Skype conversations, but all of the RT audio recording apps I've tried so far only record audio picked up from the microphone (i.e. when I play back the file, I can only hear my half of the conversation). &nbsp;Am I missing
 something, too?

<h2>            &#34;The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation.&#34; error</h2>
                    Hello everyone<br />
<br />
I am trying to create an ad-hoc network on my Windows 8 tablet (Acer Iconia W510). When I used the command netsh wlan show drivers, under Hosted Network Supported, it says yes. I then proceed to create the WiFi ad-hoc network, and it was successful except for
 the fact that it could not be started, i.e. the error "The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation". Under device manager, the main adapter, Broadcom 802.11abgn Wireless SDIO Adapter, is already activated, but the Microsoft
 WiFi Direct Virtual Adapter (it was a hidden device) cannot be enabled, showing error 45 (the hardware device is not connected to the computer).
<br />
<br />
Hence, my question is, must I actually use a WiFi dongle for me to use the virtual adapter driver which is already installed in the computer? If so, why is it that "Hosted Network Supported: Yes"? If not, how do I get around the situation to create an ad-hoc
 network for my tablet?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for the help..<br />

<h2>            Samsung new PC Studio will not install in my XP &#40;SP3&#41;</h2>
                    It worked for about a year or so.&nbsp; Then I had to reboot the PC after a power outage and when I connected the phone "New PC Studio" (hereafter called NPS) would open then close.&nbsp; After this happened a few times (which includes multiple reboots under the
 assumption it was just a bad boot), I deleted it and attempted to reinstall it.&nbsp; Then the fun began.&nbsp; The MSI seems to load okay, but just before the completion of the installation the system freezes.&nbsp; The CPU runs, but in ultra slow mode (i.e., 4 or more
 minutes to any keyboard clicks) and nothing actually loads, just an hour glass.&nbsp; I managed to bring up task manager and it showed the problem (CPU at 99%) to be in services.exe.&nbsp; I rebooted in clean mode, deactivated the non MS svc files and rebooted and ultimately
 determined the problem was Samsung's FSUSB.svc.&nbsp; If I leave it on the system begins to freeze before I can enter the login prompt.&nbsp; Turning it off (disabled) allows the system to boot normally.&nbsp; There is no record of NPS being re-installed but the folders
 are there and so is the FSUSB...exe file.&nbsp; I have tried Dial a fix tools, SFC checker, resetting WMI, reset networking, reset security policies, MSI, etc.&nbsp; I even did a Repair of XP with the XP disk.&nbsp; It doesn't matter.&nbsp; Using other companies tools (i.e.,
 Macecraft JV16) I can delete all traces of NPS, do a reboot and try the reinstall again.&nbsp; And again, it all begins looping as soon as the FSUSB portion of the install begins.&nbsp; Yes, I am running IE 8 amd Media Player 11 as required by NPS.&nbsp; I have even tried
 reinstalling those MS programs (kind of had to after running XP repair as it defaulted them back to earlier versions).&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; Because there was a chance the copy of NPS I had was bad I downloaded a new copy (which took a whole day on dial up, more
 than 100 megs at 20 megs an hour).&nbsp; The new copy of NPS makes no difference.&nbsp; Dr. Watson does not report an issue when everything freezes (i.e., services.exe being stuck in a loop) and there does not appear to be any log (C:\documents.., local/temp) being
 kept of the unsuccessful installation attempts of NPS.&nbsp; [Probably because the log is generated after installation not in the middle of the installation.]&nbsp; So I have no clue as to what is happening and why after two years of good service the program has suddenly
 gone buggy and won't install.&nbsp; Until I can get this repaired I am using dial up (yuck).&nbsp; I consider myself an experienced novice so any pointing in a direction to go is appreciated.&nbsp; My suspicion&nbsp; is something in how services.exe should be handling FSUSB got
 corrupted, but I have no clue what.&nbsp; The JV16 registry check doesn't see it, everything else works just fine, and in any case XP Repair off the original CD should have fixed any registry issues.<br />

            Please note that it worked just fine in my XP SP3 for about a year with no problems.&nbsp; If I had to put a finger on an event, I suspect one of the auto updates received via Secunia on the day New PC Studio suddenly started acting buggy.&nbsp; No, I have no idea
 which one.&nbsp; My connection is/was dynamic.&nbsp; Sometimes the PC will be offline from the Internet for a week or more.&nbsp; Earlier the day NPS stopped my PC experienced Microsoft Update, Flash Update, Quicktime Update, SuperAnti Spyware update and AVG update then
 Java update plus whatever other goodies Secunia found.&nbsp; Then I rebooted as several programs asked me to.&nbsp; After that NPS no longer connected me to the Internet.&nbsp; I thought a simple re-install would fix things.&nbsp; Little did I know the PC has no intention of
 ever again allowing a reinstallation.&nbsp; I have no clue what is wrong because the silly installation file doesn't keep a log (or at least none I can find).&nbsp; I tried it again yesterday and for the first time in months actually got an error message during the
 installation (just before everything froze) "wmfdist.exe" failed.&nbsp; A clue?&nbsp; Apparently not.&nbsp; I deleted all Media Player files, then ran XP repair (from the CD), reinstalled Media Player 11 and did a regsvr32 on about 3 dozen dll files associated with 11, then
 tried to reinstall NPS again.&nbsp; This time no error message, just a nice system freeze just before it should have said installing drivers.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Power off, go in in safe mode, run services.msc and disable the fsusb service then reboot normally and go in and
 remove the failed NPS installation again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Done this drill so many times now I am tempted to design a macro for it.&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
Yes, I talked to Samsung.&nbsp; Months ago.&nbsp; What a useless joke their help desk was.&nbsp; First they try to sidestep everything by emailing me dead links to where the 178 meg installation file can be downloaded (via my dial up).&nbsp; Followed by a survey to see if the
 instruction to simply try again was helpful.&nbsp; Finally I found a phone number somewhere for their actual help desk.&nbsp; Turned out the person working there was not knowledgeable and merely was reading from the same program manual PDF file the users already have.&nbsp;
 Finally that person realizes what I needed wasn't in that manual, so she 'switches me to her supervisor,' and disconnects me (i.e., hung up).&nbsp; Tried again, got a different person to read me the manual I already had.&nbsp; Verified I had all of the piggy back programs
 (XP, Outlook, IE8, MediaPlayer 11, etc.) I was supposed to, then switched me their supervisor (strange deja vue feeling at this point), and I got to listen to almost a whole hour of Samsung Galaxy ads while I waited for someone to pick up the phone.&nbsp; (TG for
 speaker phones.)&nbsp; Halfway through the novel I was now reading someone picked up, and stated he was the supervisor and knowledgeable.&nbsp; However as soon as I described the symptoms (i.e., the MSI initiates FSUSB.exe and then Services.exe simply freezes which
 also freezes everything else) he announces services.exe is a Microsoft program and therefore the problem is a Microsoft program.&nbsp; Inquiries as to the possibility that a registry setting is somehow changed or corrupted (not shown when I run chkdsk) are also
 met with the same statement, i.e., the registry is Microsoft's not Samsung's and he is therefore not going to discuss registry settings.&nbsp; He then tells me it is all Microsoft's fault for making XP so complicated and tries to interest me in a Galaxy phone (this
 was just before the court ruling on those) to replace my Rugby.&nbsp; Further questioning left me with the impression he had no clue about registry settings and had no resources at hand other than the aforementioned PDF file which I already have on the CD that
 came with the phone.<br />
<br />
So anyway, my problem is the silly program first stopped working in August and ever since after a clean uninstall now refuses to complete installation.&nbsp; It gets past the accept user conditions screen, and past 'removing backup files' then freezes the machine.&nbsp;
 Exploring with Task Manager (which takes up to 15 minutes to finally pop up after doing CTRL ALT DELETE shows services.exe is now eating 100% of CPU power.&nbsp; Pressing the Start button will eventually bring up the RUN bar, but of course since Services.exe is
 being a memory hog, absolutely nothing typed in there will work.&nbsp; Likewise the Turn OFF button will not work while services.exe is stuck in its loop (I say loop because sometimes if I use Task Manager to try to shut things down by killing System, all I accomplish
 is the unintentional opening of a new second Task Manager, or a third, or 20.&nbsp; The only solution I have found once the NPS MSI routine starts the FSUSB Service is to simply pull the plug in the back of the machine, then reboot into safe mode and disable FSUSB,
 then reboot.<br />
<br />
I am at my wits end trying to figure out what has happened and why what used to work suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; I honestly thought simply re-installing XP (i.e. Repair), reinstalling IE 8, Outlook, WMPlayer 11, using Dial a Fix to clean out my SFC file cache
 and reinstall them from the CD, even resetting permissions and reinstalling WMI/WBEM would have an effect, but nope.&nbsp; It all still just hangs as soon as the FSUSB service is installed.&nbsp; Adding to my aggravation is two other (equally updated) XP machines in
 this house with NPS installed work just fine.&nbsp; I am left with the belief, suspicion, that there is something in the registry that is corrupted, something not even touched by a reinstallation of XP done with the install/repair procedure, but nothing I have
 found online has given me any clue to date.<br />
<br />
I have got 3 months to go on the phone contract.&nbsp; I probably will not go Samsung this time around.<br />

            <p>Hi JeyMa,<br />
<br />
Based on the error message, I suggest you check if the drivers and the Skype for Business client on the affected computer are all up to date and whether the latest patches have been installed at first. If the issue persists in the latest version, I’d like to
 look into the issue with the following details:<br />
1. Could you reproduce the issue every time when waking PC up from sleep mode? </p>
<p>2. When did the user notice this issue? Did it occur recently after installing some Windows updates or a specific program?</p>
<p>3. Try to run an online repair for the Skype for Business program to see if there is any improvement. For your reference:<br />

4. Run a clean boot on the affected desktop to check the issue. <br />

Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community forums!<br />
To resolve error "LCD Color Management defective, rerun monitor calibration" on the computer, you may try the suggestion.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>The error message is because the color profile named "<strong>LCD color management and conversion</strong>" likely really is defective. Profiles are complex things and are not always properly crafted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Try these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>a. Click Start, then type <strong>color management </strong>into the search box.<br />
b. When Color Management comes up, click it.<br />
c. Click the Devices tab to see or change what profile is associated with your monitor.<br />

    <title>Why can&#39;t I see my album art on my mp3 files in win8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doccolour  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see my album art on my mp3 files in win8&#63;</h2>
                    Ok, so here's the deal... I just&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;all my mp3 files from my Vista laptop to my new Win8 laptop and now I can't see the album art, all I can see is the iTunes logo instead. On my Vista laptop, the album displayed fine.
<div>I even copied some of these mp3 files to my mom's win7 computer as a test... and the album art showed up fine on her computer. What's that problem with my win8 laptop not showing my album art??</div>
<div>It DOES show the album art in iTunes, but NOT in my folders where I keep my music files. I'm racking my brain on this one...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also I have a lot of Adobe Illustrator files as well and those files show 'blank page icons' instead of the AI 'orange logo'... Ug!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could someone please offer a solution towards helping me solve this baffling problem??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thank you for your feedback,</div>

            <div>Hi ,</div>
<div><br />
I understand that you are not getting the album art for your music files in your Windows 8 computer.<br />
<div>I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Run SFC / Scannow. Please follow the below steps:<br />
</strong><br />
Run the System File Checker (SFC) scan. Follow these steps:<br />
a) Boot to the desktop view.<br />
b) Open command prompt, right click in the left corner when the Start window appear and select command prompt (admin).<br />
c) Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow.<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p>
</strong>
<div><strong>To refresh your PC</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap Change PC settings.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click Settings, and then click Change PC settings.)<br />
2. Under PC settings, tap or click General.<br />
3. Under Refresh your PC without affecting your files, tap or click Get started.<br />
4. Follow the instructions on the screen.<br />
<div>Note: The apps that came with your PC or you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed. Windows puts a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.<br />
<div>Please reply with the status of the issue and we will be happy to help you.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I do appreciated this reply and I thank you for your suggestion, but to be honest, the steps in both methods you suggested seem like such a bother (having to reboot or reinstalling my non-window store apps).
<br />
<br />
I was really hoping to receive a simple solution to this issue... like having to change a simple setting or something. Oh-well, my fingers are still crossed that there is a much easier fix to this issue.
<br />
<br />
Thanks again&nbsp; <br />

    <title>Issue with extreme console lag&#47;loading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chi_bearhawks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with extreme console lag&#47;loading</h2>
                    
<p>My girlfriend made an XBL account on my HDD. She has her own Xbox, so we wanted to transfer it over to her own HDD. Since we needed to transfer a saved game file, we simply moved the data to a 64MB memory card and then into the HDD.</p>
<p>The problem is after I moved the data to the memory card, there was a bunch of lag when moving it onto her HDD. It would take severral minutes just to load the list of memory options (HDD and MU), and several minutes just to sign the account into XBL. Now,
 whenever she signs into XBL, it takes several minutes to sign in, as oppose to the usual ~4 seconds. Once signed in, none of the images on the dashboard will load for advertisements and links because the console is behaving so slow. Loading anything, such
 as a game or accessing the Console Options will take several minutes. If a Title Update is needed for a game (even a small 4 MB one that takes a few seconds), the download will stay at 1% the whole time, time out, and kick us back to the dashboard. Everything
 is just unbelievably slow.</p>
<p>I've cleared the cache when loading the console, but that didn't seem to help anything.&nbsp; I know for a fact that this is a local issue, and not an internet connection issue. This also happens on both hers and my Xbox. It seems to just be her account/HDD.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer ANY insight as to what is causing this, or any possible solutions?</p>

<p>So to be sure, the issue is only with her account, correct? If you've been loading from the memory card this whole time, I recommend recovering her gamertag from Xbox LIVE. If this is not an option, I recommend moving her profile back onto the HDD and using
 a different memory device, such as a USB <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/Pages/xbox-360/how-to/usb-flash-drive.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
configured for use with Xbox 360.</a></p>

<h2>            Blutooth services</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My android phone is paired to windows 10 laptop through bluetooth. However, the services that are available in windows 7 like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headset profile(Audio Gateway)</li><li>Handsfree profile (Audio gateway)</li><li>Audio Video Remote control (Target)</li><li>Advanced audio distribution profile (Source)</li><li>Audio/Video Remote control</li></ul>
<p>I could not find in windows 10. Infact, in windows 7, when the device list is opened, it shows several options to connect the device for media access or so, but on clicking the device in windows 10, just shows an option: Remove device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you plz explain the issue and the troubleshooting technique.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, if your product is working fine, and the driver update doesn't provide some previously unavailable function, then don't fix what isn't broke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you don't say is whether your current driver is Microsoft Windows "Approved" / "Certified". As far as my own personal opinion goes, I'm a firm believer in "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.". I've seen too many&nbsp;otherwise good products (video cards, sound
 cards, etc.) get trashed because someone downloaded and installed a new driver over one that was working just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as your machine is working well, leave well enough alone would be my advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what you decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<p>&nbsp;Local ID: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1033</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the folowing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. From a Windows 7 OEM DVD I entered install.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Select Repair when prompted from advanced options.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Select the Command Prompt.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be drive E: or F:. You do it by typing the commands</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Type these commands:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32\config</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy *.* Q:\RegBack\</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd RegBack</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\Regback to Q:\Windows\System32\config.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not fix my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I loaded the drive up and copied the windows\system32\config\*.* from the shadow volume and moved it to the \\windows\system32\config\ location in an attempt to take the shadow copy of the registry and load it as the current registry</p>
<p>
</p><p>finally ran startup repair again and still get the registry corrupt response</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Sometimes it gets to the "Press Start", sometimes it even freezes before that. The picture of the general that appears at the top of the start screen, sometimes shows up, sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes its opaque. I guess,
 it all depends on where the game freezes (whether before or during the animation).</p>
<p>Once the game froze, there is nothing you can do but restart the 360. Pressing buttons on the controller doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>It looks as if it's the same problem as with Kinect Fun Labs, which keeps freezing on me in a similar fashion.</p>

    <title>After updating to Win 10 screen locks if unattended for too long, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pantherealeonis  say:</h3>
<h2>            After updating to Win 10 screen locks if unattended for too long, and cannot be opened except with a hard shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Windows 10, and I have been noticing some strange behavior.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave my computer for some time, going down to dinner, leaving it on overnight or through a school day, often when I return the screen has turned off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This in itself is normal, as I've told it to shut off the screen after 10min, and often I manually turn the screen off. Most times I can just move the mouse, and it resumes as if nothing happened, or if that doesn't work, I can move the mousepad, which is
 normal behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, many times this does not work. My computer will for all intents and purposes be off when I return to it. Moving mouse/mousepad does not work, and neither does pressing any buttons.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually have "power off" as a command set to a simple press of the on/off button, but pressing it to start the shutdown process does not work, and my computer will not respond to me before after a hard shutdown, holding the power button for five seconds
 as usual. After the shutdown it will work normally until the next time this problem arises, which seems to be at random whenever my computer is unattended for more than 3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly related is a problem I noticed while still using the computer earlier today. My screen would go black, then shut off, come back on to what I was doing, go black again, this time with a green field, akin to the notice fields, go black, turn off and
 come back. All the while I heard the "connected device"/"disconnected device" sounds. This whole incedent lasted just 10-20seconds in total and my computer appears to work fine after it. Sound played normaly throughout the incident.</p>

            Hi MegaMoh <br /><br />Please try the steps below,<br /><br />1. Click Start ----&gt; Control Panel -----&gt; Region and language settings ----&gt; enable the appropriate keyboard language.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />2. When ever you want to type either arabic or Hindi you can select the input language from key board language options in the taskbar.
