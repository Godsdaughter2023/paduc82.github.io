<h2>            Windows 10 Creator Update - No signal on HDMI monitor.</h2>
                    <p>I've been in an endless loop since the update was pushed to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It asks me to update, I let it, and then Windows starts up and my PC no longer sends a video signal to my monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hold down the power button until it shuts down, it says "Restoring your previous version of Windows" and then everything is great again, until it asks me to update. Repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is an HDMI support issue of some kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to start scheduling the update for weeks in the future every time it asks. Please fix it so I can update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 error</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 a few days ago. laptop today took ridiculously long to boot and log in. Eventually got the following prompt "onedrive.exe - bad image" "C:\users\wes\appdata\local\microsoft\onedrive\17.3.6301.0127\ msvcr120.dll is either not designed
 to run on windows or it contains an error. error status 0xc000020" &nbsp;As long as I don't close the window or click ok I can do a few things on the pc but it is horrifically slow. Close the window or click ok and the pc freezes. Tried restarting several times,
 same thing each time. the sfc scan gets 3% done before freezing. Laptop is about 2 years old and ran Windows 8.1 just fine before upgrade.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted from a Windows 10 install dvd, created after downloading the ISO file from microsofts website. the menus were different from what you described but there was an automatic repair option for startup issues. After a few minutes it returned a message
 that said it could not fix the problem, but did not provide any more information, error codes, etc.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Repair Install seemed to resolve my issues. </span>
As I say above, I monkey'd with resetting registry permissions and system restore. ...mostly unsuccessful, though I did get BACK IN, &amp; a few functions back. So I resorted to Repair Install, not re-install or factory install.
<br />
</span>Yah, some programs needed reinstalling, but basically got my stuff back OK, even most drivers &amp; services. In fact, despite having to re-download all the windows updates since sp1 (because I lacked internet during update),
<br />
<br />
1) try to get yr reg permissions back </span>(subinacl, secedit, etc) &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">
if that fails, consider... </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"><br />
2) a Repair Install,</span> using a win7 install ISO download. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2a) <span style="font-weight: bold">Find a 'windows 7' 'digital river' download link</span> on the web.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know if M$ answers their front door. This one worked OK for me:&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Windows 7 Professional x86 SP1 U (media refresh) X17-59183.iso<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"> 2b)</span><span style="font-style: italic">...then</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"> follow Repair Install directions,</span> like on this page:<br />

<h2>            I cannot find a way to create a new folder in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>I haven't found a reasonable way to create a new folder in Windows 8.&nbsp; File Explorer has a "new folder" option on the "home" tab but when I click on it, file explorer closes down and the Windows 8 start desktop appears.&nbsp; The only way I've been able to create
 a new folder is to use the "mkdir" xxxx command in the command prompt, then moving the new folder to my desired location.&nbsp; I'm assuming that the "new folder" option in file explorer is there for a reason.&nbsp; Any opinions?&nbsp; Do I have a registry or permissions
 issue even though I don't receive any error messages?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I upgraded to Windows 8 pro from Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your detailed answer!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I still have the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your question - I have been unable to create a new folder in Windows 8 since I installed the Windows 8 upgrade three weeks ago.&nbsp; I have installed all of the subsequent updates.</li><li>Method 1 (run sfc scan) - I followed your instructions re:&nbsp; using the command prompt to run sfc/scannow.&nbsp; I received an error message saying that this command could only be used by an administrator who is logged on to a console session.&nbsp; I double-checked
 my user status in Windows 8 and I AM shown as an administrator.&nbsp; There are no other users set up on my computer (a desktop) so I am mystified by this error message.&nbsp;
</li><li>Method 2 (Safe mode) - I followed your instructions to start in safe mode (it took quite a long time to boot in this mode but my PC eventually did).&nbsp; I attempted to create a new folder using file manager, but I was unable to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I clicked on the
 "new folder" icon (which was NOT grayed out), the file manager window immediately closed and the Windows 8 start menu flashed on the screen for about a second.&nbsp; This was followed by my Windows 7 desktop.&nbsp; This is exactly the same sequence that I encountered
 when attempting to create a new folder while not in the safe mode.&nbsp; I did not receive any error messages.</li><li>Method 3 - I did not attempt method 3 because your answer indicated that method 3 should be used if I didn't have the problem in safe mode.&nbsp; Since I did have the problem in safe mode and your instructions did not discuss what I should do in this instance,&nbsp;I
 did not pursue this further.</li></ul>
<p>I would appreciate any additional thoughts/advice.&nbsp; How can I run sfc/scannow?&nbsp; Is there something I can do to tell Windows 8 that I am an administrator?&nbsp; Does this result point to a possible source of the problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>I am new to Windows 8 as well and I should say that the problem with creating a new folder is very surprising considering that in Windows XP you were needed only to click on File and you would see the first option New Folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way I did it so far, I selected File Explorer icon and then selected Documents from the Library group and then renamed one of Youcam folders. As a result a new Youcam was created as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should say that all proposals above seems to me too complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that Windows 8 a lot less user friendly than previous releases.</p>

<p>The tooltip says "in the current location".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like you need to select something and then use the button?&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't but it put one in the "current directory" e.g. as specified by the Address bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if I navigate to just Libraries it limits the

            <p>This Windows 8 problem of not being able to create folders is a real pain in the neck.</p>
<p>A simple solution should be that Microsoft acknowledge this problem and get a fix out. Obviously something happened thru one of their updates because about two or three weeks ago I was able to make new folders, where I wanted them. Not anymore.</p>
<p>Even the yellow black books are warning us not to go to Windows 8 but now that we are there what are we to do?</p>

            <p>I've had my new Windows 8 laptop for about a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have any problem creating folders UNTIL TODAY (24Sep13). I go to the C: drive (I wish it would just open to that, but it doesn't), and I click on the "New Folder" button, and it gives me a security warning about making changes to the computer, and
 saying I need administrator permissions to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click the various sequence of buttons that essentially say, "Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do it", it goes ahead and creates the folder. It also does this every time I want to write a file to the C: drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's weird is <em>it didn't used to do this</em>. Something has <em><u>changed</u></em> in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discovered this in the context of trying to solve the bug in Outlook 2013 that causes it to delete read messages from the inbox, without provocation or direction. I got a suggestion from a Microsoft-ish person to try disabling all the add-ins, and that
 seemed to work, but now it doesn't anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is, are these systems (W8/O2013) inherently unstable, or are they being changed on the fly in the background with inadequate testing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is extremely disappointing.</p>

<p>Where does it open?&nbsp;&nbsp; So where are you creating your New Folder?&nbsp;&nbsp; Security warnings are normal, especially when you try making changes to the root.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some administrators disallow that.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. make your changes in one of the provided subdirectories.&nbsp; Does
 that cause the same symptom?</p>

            <p>It opens to a list of content-type based sub-folders. I've always hated that format. What I did was, I would click on the C: drive, and create my sub-folders in that. That's never been a problem before in the decades I've used Windows. It wasn't a problem
 on <em>this</em> machine until yesterday! The security warnings are NOT normal in that context. I've seen them before when some alien program is going to change my machine, which I want, but not when I was just putting in a new folder on my own machine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, the problem is moot now. Between that and the problems I was (may still be) having with Outlook 2013, I decided to install the field beta of W8.1 (they call it a "Preview" version, but I don't see any practical distinction between that and a field beta).
 I figured if I was going to be a beta tester anyhow, I may as well do it on the most recent version!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The directory creation problem is totally gone. The entire way it opens file explorer is vastly superior, and now allows you to either do as you suggest with the content-type sub-folders, or do it the way I've always done it, at the user's option. That's
 the way it should be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So far, every change I've noticed from 8.0 to 8.1, has been a good change. But, I would caution people before simply doing the update to 8.1. Microsoft on their site gives the following warnings:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They said it would take a long time to install. It did.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They said it would be changing a lot. It is. I got 17 updates 10 hours after the initial installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They were also very explicit about saying that 8.1 was for “experienced users only”. Now, I don’t consider myself a PC power user
 by any means (although I’m a lot closer than I was 10 days ago), but I figured in the context of their overall audience for that statement, I’d qualify.</span></p>
<p>Microsoft is clearly moving in the right direction with 8.1, and they're clearly not there yet. My recommendations would be:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you’re running W8.0, and it’s not giving you any trouble, leave it alone.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you’re having problems
 with W8.0, and you’re not intimidated by weird machine behavior, go ahead and do the 8.1 update.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you’re having problems
 with W8.0, and you hate dealing with “system” stuff, either live with the problems, revert back to W7, or find someone who’s been playing with the W8.1 update to help you with it.</span></li></ol>
<p>This update also vastly improved (ie, shrank) the grotesquely oversized message header that originally came with Outlook 2013. I don't know if they've fixed the O2013 "auto-delete" problem yet, but I'll find out soon enough!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As of this morning, W8.1 was incompatible with Norton 360 security. I'm sure that will get fixed, but as of this morning, it hadn't been.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8.X--It's not just an operating system, it's an adventure!</p>

            The RT is not popping up any passcode. My 9350 does and at the same time the RT says 'it isn't working, try again'. Can theses two be paired? They seem to find each other with no problem.

            <p>Windows 7 organizes files and folders a bit differently than Windows XP.&nbsp; In particular, a Windows 7 library is a consolidated view of related files in one place.&nbsp; If you look at your Documents library, you'll see that there is a line that says something
 like:&nbsp; "Includes X locations," where the X is probably 2, but could be 3 or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7bb450a-cfc4-4b02-82ca-0ab07942b37a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7bb450a-cfc4-4b02-82ca-0ab07942b37a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you click on that link, you'll see something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48ccc356-a6a9-4891-950a-16c0a6eadeee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48ccc356-a6a9-4891-950a-16c0a6eadeee" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In your case, you seem to have created two folders named Word.&nbsp; Figuring out where the folders are located is made even more difficult because in Windows 7, the folder that displays as "My Documents" is actually named "Documents" -- at least the default
 folder of that name that is automatically created by Windows.&nbsp; The screenshot above shows the same behavior with respect to the "My Pictures" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you make the folder that now has all of the documents your "Default save location" (which you can do by right-clicking on it in the window shown above).&nbsp; Then move the single document from the other "Word" folder into your "Default save location"
 and delete that folder.</p>

"setup could not complete downloading and installing files to your computer due to a problem with your network of internet connection"<br />

<p>Hi there Neykrid,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I understand there is an issue with not being able to review the Xbox Game Pass Quests. I recommend to try re-installing the app and checking to see if the mobile needs an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a computer try visiting this website: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/quests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/quests</a></p>
<p>On your Xbox Console: Head to the Game Pass Tab on the Dashboard, scroll all the way to the bottom and you should see Game Pass Quests</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and let us know the results.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Troubleshooting&#58; Windows Kernel event ID 41 error &#34;The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first&#34;</h2>
                    I'm having trouble with this error just a few days ago.&nbsp; When it happened, it had hard shut down, like situation 3 described here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504/en-us<br />
It happened completely randomly and I can't reproduce the problem effectively to determine the cause.&nbsp; It would happen while idling, browsing sites, listening to music, games, etc.&nbsp; Random is really the correct word for it.<br />
I have not added anything recently, hardware wise, for more than a year or so.&nbsp; There's no BSOD, just the event error described in the microsoft support site mentioned above (situation 3).<br />
<br />
First initial things I did:<br />
Tested both sticks of ram individual for 6 passes in memtest (pass)<br />
Removed all my storage hard drives, leaving only my SSD in<br />
Completely stock, no OC,&nbsp; Default BIOS settings (I did not reset settings via battery removal, I just changed everything back to it's default settings)<br />
Checked event logs for anything related and found nothing<br />
<br />
First I want to say that temperatures is NOT a problem.&nbsp; My CPU is idling at ~30C and never gets past 60C during load, even during my various testing.&nbsp; My GPU idles at ~30C, and never gets past 60C either, during testing mentioned below.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
From here I methodically added pieces back to my computer:<br />
1.&nbsp; SSD only, 1xRAM - ran fine for about 12 hours<br />
2.&nbsp; SSD only, 2xRAM - ran fine for about 27 hours<br />
3.&nbsp; SSD, 1xHDD (7200), 2xRAM - ran fine for about 24 hours (Nov 13, 2013 there were updates for windows which I installed at this point)<br />
4.&nbsp; SSD, 1xHDD (7200), 1xHDD (5200), 2xRAM - ran fine for about 20 hours<br />
5.&nbsp; SSD, 1xHDD (7200), 2xHDD (5200), 2xRAM - in approximately 7 hours it failed and shut down (I installed the intel matrix drive for
<span>AHCI</span> support over the default windows 7 driver before doing this. As a result, I uninstalled it after this happened)<br />
<span>AHCI</span> support over the default windows 7 driver before doing this. As a result, I uninstalled it after this happened)<br />
<br />
From here, I went back to #4, and it failed quickly.<br />
<br />
Still on #4, I ran furmark just to see if something was related to my GPU, it failed in about 7 minutes.&nbsp; I tried it again a second time and it failed at around the same time.&nbsp; Here, when it restarted, it had power cycled several times,&nbsp; 8 times or so, when
 trying to boot to Windows.&nbsp; 3 power cycles and I could hear the computer trying to boot but failing and restarting very quickly, fast enough that it didn't show the post screen at all.&nbsp; The 4th time it got to my windows login screen, but shut down again, then
 another 3 power cycles later, not making it past post, then I was finally able to log back in.<br />
<br />
Without doing any changes, still on #4, I tried OCCT's power supply test for 15 minutes and passed it.&nbsp; Then right after that I tried furmark again, and passed that.<br />
<br />
My computer specs are:<br />
Win7 x64 (as of Nov 16, 2013, I am fully updated)<br />
Q6600<br />
Asus p5q pro<br />
2x2gb OCZ 800mhz ram<br />
Corsair TX750v2 (750w) (I had got a warranty exchange for this about maybe a year and a half ago)<br />
GTX 670<br />
Corsair M4 256gb (firmware 040H)<br />
3x1.5TB WD Green drives (5200rpm)<br />
1x500GB Seagate (7200rpm)<br />
<br />
I'm completely at a loss and I can't figure out what is causing this problem for me.&nbsp; Up until now, my computer had run fine.&nbsp; I read on various forums while search for a solution that the PSU is most likely the problem, but I'm not sure why I can't reproduce
 the shutdown when I try to stress it with various tests like OCCT Power supply test or Furmark.&nbsp; Someone had a solution which involved turning on C1E in the BIOS for power saving, but this hasn't helped me.&nbsp; I really do hope this isn't a motherboard problem
 as I am out of warranty, and no one sells LGA775 boards anymore where I am.<br />
<br />
I know this problem is apparently hard to find a solution to, but anyone can please give me some ideas or something to try I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
--Edit--<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that I had gone into Safe Mode once just to see if it would stop.&nbsp; However, it did not help.<br />

            Just earlier, it failed on my was working testing scenario #3 so I'm really at a loss.<br />
Things I've changed now are I refreshed my BIOS with the latest one.&nbsp; I already had it installed but I did it again anyway.&nbsp; As well as resetting the CMOS.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I'm running driver verifier , so far for about 2 hours now.<br />

            It had crashed, maybe 4 hours total, while using driver verifier.&nbsp; But it didn't produce any BSOD, it just crashed the same way as described in situation 3, like someone pulled the power cord or something.<br />
<br />
So, since then I've used a spare mechanical drive and installed linux on it to try to rule out the hardware problem or something with either my SSD, or my windows install.<br />
<br />
I had to restart a few times, while installing linux and updates, and during boot it would sometimes do what I mentioned above: not post, power cycle a few times, and then it would get to the linux login screen.&nbsp; So I don't know if this means there's something
 wrong with my PSU or something.<br />
<br />
It has been about, maybe ~15hours while idling, browsing, doing what I would usually do and nothing has happened yet.&nbsp; But if my previous tests that lasted for more than ~24hours without fail, but after going back to it it would randomly fail within ~5 hours,
 so I'm still waiting for something to happen.&nbsp; If I can go for maybe another 10 so hours without problems I think that I will clone my SSD onto this HDD and try to rule out whether or not it's the SSD or Windows install.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I have everything I usually have plugged into my computer.<br />

            I replaced my PSU just to test it and it did work for maybe 16 some hours but it restarted on me again.<br />
<br />
These new errors were in my event viewer:<br />
An error was detected on device \Device\Harddisk0\DR0 during a paging operation. (appearing 31 times)<br />
The system failed to flush data to the transaction log. Corruption may occur. <br />
Both were around the same time, 10am.<br />
<br />
My shutdown happened at 6pm, so I believe they may be unrelated.<br />

Is it my motherboard or something related to my SSD?&nbsp; <br />

            I'll give it a shot, but, would a clone of my current SSD be fine?&nbsp; I made one during my linux testing just in the off chance my SSD was a problem.&nbsp; It has shut down on me in safe mode once, so that is what made me think that it was hardware problems..<br />
<br />
I'm using crystaldisk as my HDD monitor and they are all relatively cool.&nbsp; The hottest drive is my 7200rpm drive, 38C.&nbsp; The rest are ~35C.&nbsp; I'm using the coolermaster 690, the first version.&nbsp; I have a direct fan blowing over my HDDs which is also an intake.&nbsp;
 I guess I'll state that I have about 6 fans.&nbsp; Both my old and testing PSU should have no problems powering everything I have.&nbsp; When I got my testing PSU, I had cleaned out my case again, more thoroughly.&nbsp; I gave another check over the mobo to see if I could
 see any problematic leaking caps.&nbsp; I'm an amateur in hardware testing, but I believe that the caps are fine.&nbsp; Made sure everything was seated properly when I put my testing PSU in.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can a non-os HDD really cause all these problems?&nbsp; I'm using them exclusively for storage.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention,&nbsp; during my linux testing, I had to restart once.&nbsp; It had cycled this time like I described above (before post shown, restart, etc) but this time something different happened.&nbsp; This time my USB devices had no more power being supplied to
 them, no video, only the fans were running.&nbsp; A restart via the power button didn't fix it and I had to reset the CMOS to get it working again.&nbsp; This when I was using my TX750 though.&nbsp; I haven't had it occur with my Antec High Current Pro 750 testing unit I
 temporary bought.<br />

            It shutdown while I was using my hdd-clone drive.<br />
<br />
So I decide to move my entire machine to another room, to another outlet, to see if it was just house related electrical problems, or that outlet only.<br />
<br />
The BIOS seems to be taking a long time to show the post screen now.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Replacing the mobo battery?&nbsp; Everything seems to point to the mobo as the failing part, but if something else comes to mind please advise.<br />
<br />
--Edit--<br />
<br />
Could it possibly be something related to a damaged temperature sensor on the board or the cpu itself?&nbsp; I never actually checked the temperature right after a reset in the BIOS but I am dead sure the computer isn't over heating...<br />

            <p><em>"I'm using the coolermaster 690, the first version."</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>UH-oh.. I have a Coolermaster 690, but not the first version. Mine is the 'advanced' and I too had problems just like you have.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had no idea where to start with troubleshooting, and suspected everything, the PSU, mobo, memory, drives, installation. I rebuilt the mobo from scratch twice and still it would just turn itself off. I re-cabled everything inside to ensure that I spread
 the load across all of the outlets</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then I made a breakthrough. If I used&nbsp;the front panel USB ports or moved the jacks in the audio header, there was a very good chance that it would shut down straightaway. So it could still be the motherboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had the working part of a USB/Audio header which I had removed from another computer and hooked it up to the mobo in place of the Coolermaster header, and guess what? No more shutdowns. This test showed that it wasn't the motherboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Coolermaster sell the complete top panels for the CM690 Advanced II cases but I am not sure about the CM690 mk1.. see here..
<a href="http://www.cmstore-usa.com/cases/?sort=featured&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cmstore-usa.com/cases/?sort=featured&amp;page=2</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a Live Help button there too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They also sell refurbished CM690 II USB 3.0 models for $50 which have a revised header panel with a ground cable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I like the CM690's., the X-port on the top,&nbsp;air can easily escape from the case, and it will take an 'apartment block' sized CPU cooler, but I am less enthusiastic about the electronic boards in the top panel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My story ended up well. I have the latest top panel c/w USB 3.0 headers (my mobo doesn't have USB 3.0, but the case is ready for the next mobo upgrade) and it no longer shuts down for seemingly no reason.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Of course, this might not be your problem. Your mobo might well be faulty, but I hope that it gives you something to work from. To be honest, I have seen very few mobo failures which are intermittent. They tend to either work or they don't.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I still think that you should do a clean install on a mechanical drive. Cloning the OS will take any possible issues across with it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to stay with this problem, so keep me posted. I will try to help where I can.. I have my problems with the CM690 documented in my blog if you want to take a look at the blow by blow account of what I did about it..

            What a coincidence that you have a similar case to mine, and a similar situation.
<br />
<br />
In my case, compared to yours, I'm not using the audiojacks at all on the header and the USBs work fine for me.&nbsp; I'm using a USB audio for sound so I just tucked away those audio cables in my case so they are out of the way.<br />
<br />
Further researching my problems it may be a capacitor problem, possibly.&nbsp; For your situation you had the luxury of being able to rebuild your motherboard yourself; for me, I can't do something like that. There's no shop in town where I live that can do the
 services for a reasonable price (one shop quoted me $30/cap. Really?) compared to badcaps or the Canadian company tecnopolis.<br />
<br />
The resources I used to double check my symptoms were:<br />
http://badcaps.net/pages.php?vid=5<br />
https://tecnopolis.ca/tecnopolis/leakycaps.html<br />
Which both mention that even though there is no bulging or leaking, the caps may be failing anyway.&nbsp; Most of the symptoms are pretty darn close to what I get but it's strange that I can still have my computer run for almost 40 hours, but after a restart it
 fails in 7 hours.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm considering having my all my caps replaced with new ones through badcaps or tecnopolis, buying a LGA 775 board off ebay from China (the feedback for the merchant is very good and I get 60 day warranty to test the board), or giving up and buying
 a new computer altogether (I really wanted to avoid this).&nbsp; Most likely I'll get a board off ebay.<br />
<br />
I suppose the very last test I can really do, with regards to the case grounding, is simply running everything outside of a case or remove the header electronics (I really don't use it much, the back USB ports are more than enough for me).&nbsp;

            After about 3 days of continuous usage, I turned it off completely, switching the PSU off and draining whatever left of electricity left, attempted to turned it on again and it would not post again.&nbsp; CMOS reset and it still would not post.<br />
<br />
I took everything out, leaving only the processor and HSF, but the board would not beep.<br />
<br />
Breadboarded it, and it still would not beep.<br />
<br />
Most likely the board was the problem.<br />

<h2>            Uverse and Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone else had a problem with Uverse and xbox live?&nbsp; It seems to me that I am at least a half second behind everyone else playing online.&nbsp; It is a horrible experience for anyone playing a FPS.&nbsp; Honestly, I can't tell if it is&nbsp;a connection issue with
 my self (I am actually horrible)&nbsp;or if my ISP has some latency issues at some time or another.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I even had a friend come over that is way much better with FPS games and he even said that my connection was horrible.&nbsp; I just want to know if anyone else out there has issues with Uverse, and if there is anything we can do about it....</p>

<p>A few things you can try to do.</p>
<p>1.Clear the Memory Catche on your HardDrive.And load the game to your Hard drive.</p>
<p>2.When you 1st get to the Multiplayer screen where it says Options.Go into Options and press select and see what your Bandwith is.</p>
<p>3.Do a speedtest.Goto Speedtest.net and see what your internet speed is.Also do a Ping test.</p>
<p>If all else fails call your ISP provider and upgrade to a faster connection.Or switch over to Cable.</p>
<p>Good luck.Iam not the best speller by no means,sio dont be hating if i didnt spell things right.Its a game forum not skool.lol</p>

<p>If your always playing with 3 bars or less your probably have issues with your ISP. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time trying to working with Comcast to improve my connecting...didn't work. &nbsp;I guess every area is different, but Verizon FIOS works the best where I live...for
 now. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have already cleared my cashe, been to speedtest.net. &nbsp;My most recent test on the Austin server gave me ping speeds of 164 and 151. &nbsp;I switched to the Dallas server and my ping was 31. &nbsp;I do not know what the hell is going on.

<p>Did you run the test on peak hours? Run the test during the morning or late night, cuz that happen with me all the time although I have cable. I always run the test in my iPhone, if the ping is below 50ms is time to play. If &nbsp;the ping is over 50ms you will
 have a bad connection and lag. </p>

<p>Your jitter is horrible. When is the last time you power cycled(reboot) your modem and router? Try that before you call your provider. Then try ping test again. Your ping can vary like onango said, but the jitter should be way lower. Mine tests between 1
 and 3 jitter usually.</p>

    <title>SurfacePro 4 Screen vertical jitters after 2 hours of use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pommie phil  say:</h3>
<h2>            SurfacePro 4 Screen vertical jitters after 2 hours of use</h2>
                    <p>I have a SurfacePro 4, bought January of last year. I am currently on assignment in SE Asia in a country without a Windows shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 29th September 2017 the screen has started jumping after being in use for around 2 hours. The jitters are vertical, with a smaller jump of maybe 5 pixels occuring many times a second and a larger one occurring maybe once per second, but not evenly
 space. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The jitters stop when the screen content is changed in any way, such as by typing, moving the mouse, by the minute clicking over in the task bar, or by having an application such as a stopwatch or the task manager as the top window. Without this activity
 the jitters will start within a minute but often in a second or two, and will remain until the next change of screen content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting does not make the problem go away, but leaving it powered down overnight does.</p>
<p>
<strong>Troubleshooting &amp; Background info:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>There were no major updates on the day it first started or the day before (only minor updates to some Windows Apps I don't use), nor was any new application installed on those days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Application, System and Security event logs show no unusual entries. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the day it happened the top back of the surfacepro4 (just behind the power button) felt hotter than normal. I push my device fairly hard (running three copies of Visual Studio two SQL servers and a bunch of other apps) and was running some multi-teir
 web service testing at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the SurfacePro4 for gaming or video so I haven't been working the video hard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked both the screen and video drivers. Both are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplugging the keyboard and removing my wireless mouse USB receive make not difference. Nor does removing the power cord.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone else come across this? Any advice on how to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to use Store app and getting error "Your PC is not connected to internet, try later". The error code might show up when there is an issue with the network connection. This might also occur due to issues with the
 Microsoft account settings apart from Store app settings. </p>

<strong>method 1 and method 2 </strong>as you have already tried rest of methods.</p>

<p>They delayed the force download by several months, and when they finally rolled it out this week, I thought that maybe they'd taken users into consideration and fixed the problems everyone was complaining about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope! It's slightly more stylish maybe? With custom settings that don't actually work? and looks a bit too much like Discord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still can't turn the stupid emoticons off. How hard is it??? It USED to be a feature. They're ugly and I hate them and they aggravate my migraines when my group chat sends a bunch of animated ones at once. It's inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>just incase any skype developers or "designer" reads this, let me spell it out lout for you again incase you have missed it, this skype 8 version SUCKS horse balls!</p>
<p>
</p><p>months ago when i first tested it used to be horrid already and now they force you to update to this piece of crap, why i can not even resize my chat textbox anymore, is it so hard keep the most basic UI functions?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>being able to atleast resize your chat box used to be a part of skype for like a decade, so why change it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and about the whole force update idea to begin with, why cant you allow users to make their own decisions, does skype think users can not think on their own and need a push from them, give your users the OPTION to upgrade, but dont force your **** improvement
 ideas over people's heads.</p>

                    I am now getting a Treasure Hunt logo banner in the middle of my game screen.&nbsp; It moves as the screen moves forward and backward and you can't click on any of the squares under the logo.&nbsp; Why is this happening?

            Hi Richard.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for Updates for the game in Microsoft Store app, at top right Settings ... elipsis, under Downloads and Updates. 
<br />
<br />Try resetting the game in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features, click on the game, then Advanced Options, then Reset. 
<br />
<br />If necessary, Uninstall the game, restart PC, then reinstall the game from Store under your Downloads and Updates.  
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            First, restart your computer a couple times then launch the game to see if it works.
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Treasure Hunt
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If that does not work, use the following to remove the app completely:

</p><p>I did quite an extensive search of the Internet including public Microsoft forums and private Technet databases as well and didn't see anything that specifically pointed to secure boot (which I am pretty sure I don't have enabled but I will confirm later
 this evening). If you have references, please share the links etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for today, no change. Downloads, goes to install and fails. I know it's not my machine specifically because there are so many other people with so many different machines reporting this problem.</p>

<p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupt registry settings or some third party product (or virus) can change the default configuration for running EXE files. This may lead to failed operation when you try to run EXE files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start, and then click Run.</p>
<p>2. Type "command.com" , and then press Enter. (A DOS window opens.)</p>
<p>3. Type the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "cd\"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "cd \windows"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Enter after typing each one.</p>
<p>4. Type copy "regedit.exe regedit.com" and then press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type "start regedit.com" and then press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Navigate to and select the key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command</p>
<p>7. In the right pane, double-click the (Default) value.</p>
<p>8. Delete the current value data, and then type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "%1" %*</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tip: Type the characters: quote-percent-one-quote-space-percent-asterisk.</p>
<p>9. Close Regedit utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If you are using Windows XP and you enable "System Restore" , you need to&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disable "System Restore" in "Safe Mode" before using the instructions above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Do you have time to game in college&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theatomicpeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do you have time to game in college&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>So this fall 2014, I'll be headed off to college for my freshman year. I expect to be given a lot more work than I ever did in high school, and at a much higher level (I intend to major in Computer science and minor in music).</p>
<p>Between now and then, however, I'm going to start working my job again and do various odd jobs around town as well, which will earn me a substantial amount of money. This gives me the option to purchase an Xbox One, amongst other options which are likely
 more sensible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if there's anyone out there who is currently in college and likes to play video games on any platform, I'd appreciate it if you could advise me on this: do you often find time to game in college? If so, would it be worth buying an Xbox one for this purpose?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't usually game during the week, most of it I do on the weekends. So on average, I'd say about 5 or 6 hours a week. If I did buy an Xbox one, I would seek to buy the titanfall bundle. Also, I do a lot of gaming over vacations and the summer with friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're going to school full-time AND working, you're not going to have much free time, if any at all. You'll have to attend classes, go to work, and make time for studying, reading, and doing homework. By the time you finish all of that, you'll be so
 tired that you'll just want to go to sleep. Good luck!</p>

<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Depends on how much time you want to spend studying and socializing.</p>
<p>College is the first taste of real life....other than major bills. &nbsp;But for the most part....you have work to do....and some, like me, had to work while in college. &nbsp;I still found time to game though it wasn't a whole lot.</p>
<p>Frankly....I wouldn't game too much during college. &nbsp;There are so many other things to do with your free time during the time of your life that is suppose to be the time of your life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can still do it when you want to relax and it'll be there when you get out of college when you have more free time and if you decide you hate ppl and just want to spend time with gaming characters.</p>

<p>It's all about time management, you always need a break from work and school so as long as you dedicate some of you free time or 'break time' to gaming then you should still be able to fit it in, though you are doing a double major so you can expect to be
 busy.</p>

<h2>            5.9 GB of 8 GB is listed as hardware reserved&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My RAM is mem tested and all good. Running Windows 10. 5.9GB is listed as unusable, hardware reserved!!! How do I get it back? Should I want to? My system runs great; no errors. Still, I assume that 5.9 out of 8 GB is excessive.</p>
<p>note: the common "fix" to clear max mem box in msconfig does not work! Tried it. My bios has no memory configuration settings. Where did my RAM go? Anyone, please, have a solution that does work?</p>

<p>It shouldn't be hardware reserved really, it should be like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b42db527-7398-4428-b3f0-0e7d91129f50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b42db527-7398-4428-b3f0-0e7d91129f50" /></a></p>
<p>Try resetting the bios to default. Or if you have two memory modules then remove one and boot with just one and check Task Manager should show 4GB (assuming 4GB each module). Do this for each module and then put both back. Make sure they are in the correct
 slots, if you have the option. Sometimes doing this causes the bios to save the new amounts and windows sorts itself out.</p>

            My apologies. Control panel&gt;system says i have a 64bit processor, but 32bit version of win 10. My bad. I misread that. I presume if i want full use of my ram, I'll have to uprgrade to Windows 10 64 bit! Thanks for pointing that out to me.

<p>OK that's will be it then.</p>
<p>To go from 32 to 64 bit requires a clean install of Windows 10. You will need to backup all your personal files. You have a licence to use 32 or 64 bit on your device.</p>
<p>If you don't have install media you can use the Media Creation Tool to create your own DVD or USB boot media.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Erase RW DVD&#33;</h2>
                    Hi, I've a windows installation DVD that is RW and I want to erase it and re-burn, but the 'Erase this Disc' option is greyed out and doesn't work! I tried to format this disk but it shows "The disk is write-protected". The same is the situation for every
 disk that I insert in my PC. Though, all those are re-writable. What should I do?

<p>It's just DVD RW! And if that's the case what you said above, I get the same situation when I insert a Game CD. Here're the properties of this disk:</p>

<p>A game CD is not a (RW = RE-Write). They are usually always -R.</p>
<p>You can not just erase or format CD/DVD discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-R and +R and not erasable disks</p>
<p>
</p><p>-R means you can burn to it only 1 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>+R means you can only add more content to the disc at a later time. With the exception it is not a Video DVD or Video CD or Windows install media and similar or is copy write protected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-RW means you can burn to it 1 time and then if the situation meets the criteria, you can erase the disk and re-use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>+RW means you can add to it many times, by the criteria mentioned above. And then you can also erase or format it and re-use it</p>

<p>And I just realized that the DVD RW drive, means the DVD drive has the ability to read, write and re-write.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has nothing to do with the disk you insert into the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous info covers that.</p>
