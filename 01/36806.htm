<h2>            How restore Genuine Windows 7 OEM Licence on my Lenovo G570&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Lenovo G570 laptop which was preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Basic.</p>
<p>Last week one of my&nbsp;friend told me to enter some key in "windows anytime upgrade", after entering that key my Windows installation upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate and was asking me to activate windows. The key mentioned on the bottom of my laptop doesn't
 work after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then entered another key to activate windows which I am sure is not genuine and when I search for that key on the web I can clearly find multiple result matching that key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The activation process over the phone went smoothly using that non-genuine key and to my surprise Windows online validation&nbsp;also shows my Windows to be genuine, my machine is also fully updated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to go back to my Home basic version using the key that came with my machine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your only option is to do a system recovery. This means you will need to reinstall applications and hardware drivers.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes.. </p>

                    <p>Hi my name is Arthas. I&nbsp;had a issue on the December and January Holiday sales where the games do not play on my main profile Snowdrops Gift. I&nbsp;have been contacting Microsoft Customer Support on a regular basis to try and get help fixing the issue I&nbsp;have been having with my games sending me to the Microsoft Store to purchase the games again or Freezing / Crashing during the main loading screen. I&nbsp;was suspended twice both times were on the exact date and time that a Ranger was looking into my account, I&nbsp;was told by support and by the Ranger that my account was suspended because he was looking into my account. </p><p><br /></p><p>I&nbsp;was unaware that it was in any way a violation to contact Microsoft Customer Support Agents so often for help was a violation in any way with MS&nbsp;rules. I&nbsp;wasn't contacting support for a refund since I&nbsp;know that I was issued 2 back in December when I&nbsp;was charged full price for games that were on sale. I&nbsp;have

Can you please let me with what I have been charged with? I've been calling Microsoft Customer Service (MCS) to get advice and help on a occurring issue I've had since Dec &amp; Jan Holiday Sales, first called Jan 10 2018 - Present. The games I bought are taking me to store to rebuy or will Crash/Freeze when I'm in main loading screen. That is why I have called MCS so often is to get help and advice but 85-90% of the agents I've talked to only recommend resetting the console which I've done over 182 times now. MCS agents have offered refunds, I tell them I don't want one I just want to fix and play the games. The 2 times I was suspended before I was told it was because the Ranger helping in my 2nd case was looking into my case to help with it. On both Cases they ended without giving any information even after emailing them. If it's against the rules to call MCS for help so often for help &amp; adv I am very sorry and will stop. If you have any advice on my game issue it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Snowdrops Gift,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting an inquiry regarding this enforcement. The Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team is currently investigating the circumstances behind this action, and expect a resolution within 72 hours. In the meantime, if you have any additional comments or information to provide, please use this opportunity. Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>‎6‎/‎26‎/‎2018‎ ‎7‎:‎50‎:‎03‎ ‎PM</p>
<p>Hi Snowdrops Gift, </p>
<p>This account has received two prior suspensions for marketplace theft; the first suspension was issued April 20, 2018, the second May 22, 2018. The current suspension is for the same behavior, which has continued despite XBLPET's efforts to educate this account and warn against this behavior, on May 26, 2018. </p>
<p><strong><u>As previously stated, this account has opened an excessive number of service requests with Microsoft Support, under requesting help accessing content owned by this profile. Additionally, in each instance, refund requests were made after explicitly being told on more than one occasion refunds were not an available option.</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Microsoft Services Agreement, regarding the Refund Policy: </p>
<p>"Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future." </p>
<p>This account's numerous attempts indicate a willful effort to defraud Microsoft Support, especially when the efforts continued in spite of being told the account would not receive refunds for the content.</p>
<p>Xbox Support exists to help all Xbox Live members. Inappropriate or fraudulent use of the support system threatens the integrity of Xbox Live and can delay or deny other players access to support that they need. In order to ensure the quality of Xbox Support and the integrity of the Xbox Live marketplace, fraudulent use of the support system cannot be permitted. </p>
<p>Due to the severe nature of the violation, this account can no longer be trusted to access the Xbox Live service. As a result, the account can no longer sign in to Xbox Live from any device. When a permanent account suspension is issued, XBLPET does not actively revoke an account's purchases or licenses or otherwise render existing content unplayable. Any content that has been downloaded and can be accessed without an internet connection can continue to be used by the affected account offline.

<p><strong>Me&nbsp;(I was never told until this email that it was due to the number of times I&nbsp;called support for help prior to this message was hurting me. I&nbsp;was told that it was due to the ranger looking at my account. No agent I talked to or the ranger said that it was in any way against the rules to contact support so often for help.&nbsp;I&nbsp;also never asked for refunds, the agents that I&nbsp;talked to were the ones that mentioned refunds. I&nbsp;have never called support looking for or expecting refunds all I&nbsp;have wanted and hoped for was to get help with my game issue.&nbsp;)</strong></p><p />

            <p>Thanks for posting your issue, I&nbsp;got banned on my main account as well because of the games I bought&nbsp;during the New Years sale.&nbsp; Forza Horizon 3, Fallout 4, 3 games from TellTale and others. I&nbsp;&nbsp;got perma banned because of calling support for help but like you, 99% of them are useless, you can get banned for calling support so often for help but the reason you have to call XBOX&nbsp;&nbsp;CS so often is because you can't get any help from CS. If it's Microsofts fault they will do everything to screw you over and blame you for the games not working. I&nbsp;have since given up buying any digital games since if you have issues with them then you are ****. </p><p><br /></p><p>Since 2015 the quality and knowledge and most importantly attitude of CS&nbsp;&nbsp;Agents has gone down hill so much.</p>

    <title>Black screen at random intervals after issues with 7 Days to Die - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darealwigga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen at random intervals after issues with 7 Days to Die &#40;Game&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I'm gonna go in-depth with this issue as I do not want it to be mistook for another, this happened AFTER I had issues with 7 Days to Die, a game I stopped playing because of the issues it brings. At one point I had to use Ctrl+Alt+Delete to force sign
 out because I couldn't do it any other way. Just before I logged out I got a message saying "ERROR: Illegal handing detected" or something like that. Not exactly those words but something very similar to it. After I rebooted the computer it remained black
 screen for some unknown reason. Then I picked up my TV control to change the HDMI channel (Desktop PC hooked up to my flats-creen TV via HDMI cable.) and then changed it back to the one my desktop was hooked up to. It seemed like it was fixed since I now had
 the login screen back to normal, but as soon as I entered my pin it blacked out again, and I repeated the process, and it came back up and showed the desktop. Now it happens randomly at any time even during my games, and I have no clue on how to fix it or
 on what is causing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate a response to this issue ASAP as it is intensely annoying. Thankyou! ♥</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your SSD or Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “CHKDSK X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.       
        </p>

<p>I did the scan first and it came up with no issues, but there is one thing I should mention. My Windows key no longer works for some reason, it won't bring up the command prompt and I have to search for it manually. I do not know how this happened either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ontop that, I have no clue what you mean by "<span>replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan." because I have never done this before. I've no clue what to do at that point. I appreciate the help but you'll have
 to go far more in-depth about your second recommendation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>P.S: I am diagnosed with Autism/ADHD so I do not pick up on new things quickly without very in-depth tutorials. So perhaps that'll help you deduce what needs to be said beforehand. And no, please do not tell me to use
 the second Windows key because the keyboard I use is a gaming keyboard, it only has one.</span></p>

                    <p>I recently purchased a Toshiba satellite laptop. It came with windows 8, but I immediately did the upgrade to windows 10. I am trying to access an Office 365 exchange account through the mail app. When it asks for the email and password I click continue
 and the next screen only has a "#" symbol in it and nothing else. It will not connect.</p>
<p>

    <title>Having a bizarre issue with page scrolling to the top and icon locking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having a bizarre issue with page scrolling to the top and icon locking</h2>
                    Ever since I got my new laptop 1 week ago, t his ongoing issue finally got to me:<br />
<u>Problem:</u><br />
Icons on the home screen keep locking onto the first icon at the top of the screen. i.e recycling bin.<br />
Every time I try to click on an icon, no matter if I double click or just one simple click, the highlighted icon jumps to the recycling bin. The only way I can click another icon is by using the arrow keys on the keyboard or the start menu. This problem occurs
 at random and it was present when I first did the basic windows 7 setup when you buy a new pc. Also when the "locking" issues occur, the volume settings go straight to 100 when you click on it, all folders become highlighted and when you try to type, the words
 are being placed in front of the sentence, like your mouse is clicking in the front automatically.<br />
<br />
Another issue scrolling through pages. No matter the browser or website, the page keeps scrolling to the top. It stays locked at the top of the screen even when I try to scroll down the page. Arrow keys provide a simple solution until the problem goes away.<br />
<br />
I searched the web for any solutions to the problems I am having, but I couldn't find any help at all.<br />
I checked all of my drivers, they are all up to date. I uninstalled my mouse drivers and reinstalled them, updated and still no luck.<br />
This is the first time I encountered such an issue and I am lost on what to do. Even typing this was horrid since the words I typed kept getting sent to the top of the textbox.
<br />
I am running windows 7 home premium, windows update is up to date. <br />
Any insights on this issue would be helpful!<br />

            1. Yes I have tried using a different mouse, the same issues occur for a few secs then it stops still. After some testing, I found that by typing random letters into a browsers search bar or google, the issue disappears until it occurs again. I am not
 sure if this information helps. I also tried different browsers and results are still the same.
<br />
<br />
2. I did not make any changes to the system as the issue was present when I first booted my laptop.<br />
<br />
3. My machine is a Msi GT70 - 0NC<br />
processor: Intel Core i7-3610QM<br />
Sorry, I am unsure if you need any other information.<br />
<br />
4. No, I do not get any error messages at all.<br />
<br />
I run avast, and it did not find any infections. <br />
<br />
The SFC scan returned that "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
As for the event viewer log, I tried to look for it but I could not the event of the SFC scan.<br />
On the left pane, I searched through all the options that were given:<br />
Under Event Viewer:<br />
-Custom Views<br />
-Window Logs<br />
-Applications and Services Logs<br />
-Subscriptions<br />
<br />
Restarts also resolve the issue temporarily.<br />

    <title>Win Media player flickering video playback issue in Win 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win Media player flickering video playback issue in Win 8</h2>
                    <div>When I use XVID as my encoder with screen capture programs such as&nbsp;CAMSTUDIO, on&nbsp; a machine with Win XP or Win 7 x64, the video plays back correctly using Win media player or VLC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>However, when I perform the same actions on my Win 8 laptop, I get flickering of the video when playback with Win Media player but VLC plays back without flicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something is corrupted in WIn 8.&nbsp; There is no problem with playback in a Win 8 VMware virtual machine.</p>
<p>I tried going to Windows Features to reset Win media Player, with no change in results.</p>

<p>jacquie,</p>
<p>Because your drive is not being recognized even by the BIOS then we know it is not software related and most likely a defection in the device. Could this be the reason why you had to manually remove the disk from the tray, it
 failed during operation?</p>
<p>If the device is not generating any self tests or activity when you power up then this is another confirmation.</p>
<p>Being still under warranty, I recommend you contact your laptop’s OEM for further assistance.</p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Support Community.</span></p>

<h3> kyle w mckim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Raw internal hard drive problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend gave me 2 internal 500 GB hard drives as a replacement for my computer and a friends, there is a problem with both.</p>
<p>1st hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plug the hard drive into my computer via SATA adapter, sometimes the hard drive shows up in windows explorer, with a window poping up asking to format, but when I try to format it, it says it was unsuccessful. When I go to disk management, it shows
 up as RAW format. I have tried using CLEAN ALL from diskpart but it gives an error saying something about cycle redundancy check. Is there any way to get it back to NTFS format? Also some online reading mentioned something about MBR being corrupted.</p>
<p>[Update] When I did clan all, it told me to look at the system log, the system log said my disk had a bad block? what does this man?</p>
<p>2nd hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I plug this one into my computer, it also sometimes shows up in windows explorer, but it never asks to format, when i try to open disk management with the hard drive connected, it gets stuck at "connecting to virtual disk"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody know whats going on or how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience experienced by you and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue clearly seems to be arising due to the newly installed hard drives, I would suggest you to check your hard drive for errors as of now.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong><span>command prompt tool</span></strong> in the

Type "<strong><span>chkdsk c:\</span></strong>" at the flashing prompt to begin the
<strong><span>Chkdsk</span></strong> utility. Replace "<strong><span>c:\</span></strong>" with the letter of the drive for which you want to run
 the <strong><span>Chkdsk</span></strong> utility. If the hard drive is "<strong><span>d:\</span></strong>", then type that instead.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After the "<strong><span>chkdsk c:\</span></strong>" command insert "<strong><span>\f</span></strong>" to fix errors on the disc volume or "<strong><span>\r</span></strong>"
 to recover bad sectors and then press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Restart the computer once the chkdsk is completed.</p>

<strong><span>Note</span></strong>: While performing

Try the above steps as of now and post back your results for further assistance. we'll be glad to assist you further.

<h2>            Skype number renewal</h2>
                    <p>Like several others in the forum, I have received an email talling me my Skype number is about to expire, but the link takes me to a page where I can only get a NEW number rather than renew the old one.&nbsp; It is possible that the number was set up under my
 old email address and login, but that was 10 years ago and I have no idea how to sign in to that account.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            Xbox One achievement&#47;notifications glitch&#47;bug</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone. I've encountered an issue with achievements or notifications in general but most notably the achievements. It was working fine for about a week. But now anytime a notification pops up, again mostly this happens with achievements, it stays on
 the screen for a couple of minutes instead of the normal few seconds that it used to do. I know its not a big deal, but its annoying enough that id like to try and mend the situation. If anyone has any idea on how to remedy this situation, it would be greatly
 appreciated.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. This is the first thread I've seen for it. Hope to get some answers. I found the most annoying way to fix it temporarily, is to go to Xbox home and then open the achievements. That usually gets it off screen for me, but it's a
 huge hassle.</p>

<p>I did a hard reset and Achievement Notifications are back to normal. So try holding down the Xbox button on the Xbox for 5 seconds or until it turns off and then turn it back on. Next time you get an achievement, there shouldn't be any issue. I tried and
 confirmed.</p>

<h2>            How do I disable handwriting mode when using surface pen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to disable the windows pro pen from entering handwriting mode when using the pen to select the on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>I find the best way to type is using the pen, this was ok in windows 8.1 </p>
<p>If there is no way to disable this unfortunately I will have to roll back to 8.1</p>

            Also a one click disable touch would be good. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that sometimes all one requires is pen input - without the accidental palm touches... After all Surface had been created with creativity in mind...

            <p>My workaround: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked in task manager for the file that is launched when "normal keyboard" is displayed. (Touch keyboard and handwriting panel). I right clicked it and picked the "open file location" option. And that's how I located the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Application: TabTip.exe </p>
<p>Location: C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then mapped my long press key on my surface pen to launch this desktop app.</p>

<p>Hello if you console is set to instant on then it should download the update whilst in standby. You can manually check for updates by going to the setting menu then select system/Console updates and info and if an update is available then you will see the
 option to "update now" .</p>

<p>Here is a generic answer that works for much more than just a password question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Start globe, then Help.</li><li>Type <em>password</em> (for example).</li><li>Examine the topics that you see.</li></ol>
<p>There is a lot of help in Windows help!</p>

    <title>Solitaire Collection Tri Peaks sound issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Solitaire Collection Tri Peaks sound issue</h2>
                    <br />
Solitaire Collection sound all works correctly except:<br />
<br />
TriPeaks used to have great sound effects when a pile was completed, etc. Now all of a sudden the card flips work but the other sound effects do not.&nbsp; I have set sound and music to 100 in the APP and still nothing.
<br />
<br />
All other sound in the system, games and apps works just fine - Pandora, Youtube, etc. etc.<br />
I have system sound set to max and the speaker work great.<br />
I did the APP troubleshooting procedure.<br />
I uninstalled and reinstalled the app.<br />
I have not made any changes to the system.&nbsp; It's very new (a couple months) and all I have done is add 3 or 4 apps from the app store.<br />
The only other changes would be any automatic Microsoft updates.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 is great,&nbsp; this is the only minor problem I have encountered.&nbsp; Not a big deal but it should work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any ideas.&nbsp;

            This problem is resolved!<br />
<br />
This computer is an HP Pavillion s5-1554 pc and I have it configured for automatic hardware driver updates.&nbsp; It installed an IDT audio driver today and it fixed the issue.<br />
<br />
I don't have a clue what happened initially unless HP installed a driver earlier that broke something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the problem was apparently a driver problem and I'm a happy puppy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
I LOVE Windows 8 by the way and I'm 70 years old and have been using Windows since 3.1<br />
