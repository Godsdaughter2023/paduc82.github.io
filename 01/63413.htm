<h2>            swipe from bottom&#47;top</h2>
                    I've been enjoying my surface tablet so I upgraded my laptop, but I'm frustrated because I cannot do swipe commands on my laptop<br />
<br />
I can't multi task drag apps from the left<br />
I can't swipe from bottom to load options<br />
I can't swipe from top in IE to show tabs etc.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the only thing that I can do is click and drag from top to bottom to close the app.<br />
And yes, for top/bottom/left swipes I have tried left click drag and that doesn't work.<br />

<p><br />
Do you have the Displays configured to match the way that the monitors are laid out?&nbsp;&nbsp; If not my guess would be that you just need to drag&nbsp; one monitor icon to the other side of the other one?&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, originally I made the mistake of making my wide-screen monitor my primary even though I wanted to have Metro apps running only on my Tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixing that fixed a few other issues too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW if you have a real keyboard I think you&nbsp;might find that using the equivalent keyboard shortcuts is&nbsp;preferable to problematic swiping.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; using &nbsp;Win-C&nbsp;(etc.) Win-Z&nbsp; and&nbsp; Win-Tab&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid a lot of frustration&nbsp; IMO.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that there are even new&nbsp;keyboards
 designed for W8 with keys defined to do those functions.</p>

                    <p>Hello. I have been an Elder Scrolls Online PLUS member for about one month now, and today was the day that my payment was taken out of my account for the second month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They took out the payment, but failed to keep my ESO PLUS active on my account. I did not even receive the promised benefits from paying, and I am very concerned about this!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway that this can be fixed? I am very dedicated to playing this game, and when it comes to budgeting my money, I am very serious (and don't want to mess up anything).</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Expansion Port Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Expansion Port Devices</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Anyone knows any other device that connects to the Xbox One Controller Expansion Port then the headset?<br />
(talking about the port nr 9 on <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/xbox-one-wireless-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/xbox-one-wireless-controller</a>)</p>
<p>I was wondering if it will be possible to connect alternative inputs using this port?<br />
Maybe someone even know if there is a specification out-there describing what is possible using this port?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
-Anders</p>

    <title>Re-installing Windows 7 on a new larger HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cwarep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-installing Windows 7 on a new larger HD</h2>
                    
<p>Maybe dumb questions but... When I purchased my computer it had Vista installed.&nbsp; I later purchased Windows 7 Professional Upgrade&nbsp;and upgraded from Vista.&nbsp; Now I would like to re-install Windows 7 on a much larger HD than the original HD.&nbsp; Reason is when
 Acer installed Vista it partitioned the orginal 500Gig HD giving me less than 1/2 of the 500G for&nbsp;Windows 7 &amp; the larger "D" data drive for whatever.&nbsp; I've got a new 1.5TB HD I want to reninstall Windows 7 on&nbsp;with out&nbsp;making&nbsp;a "D" data partition drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Q1:Will Windows allow me to do that?&nbsp; Q2: If it will allow me to&nbsp;"reinstall" Windows 7 on a blank HD, will it also allow me to "recover" all my previously installed programs&nbsp;and files&nbsp;saved&nbsp;from my backup image of the original HD that I saved on a 3rd blank
 HD?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can reinstall on the new drive, but you will need to reinstall the applications and make sure your personal files and settings are backed. It would be more convenient if you backuped your current installation as a system image and restore it on the larger
 drive. You will need an intermediate storage medium such as an external hard disk to do that.</p>

<p>I hope what you are saying is what I'm thinking you're saying??&nbsp; Instead of "reinstalling" Windows 7 on this new larger HD, are you saying I can just "restore" my current system image on it?&nbsp; I hope that will do what I want, but now I have to tell you more
 and ask another question.&nbsp; I thought I could get away with "cloning" the old HD, so I bought the 'Perfect Image' software program and went through the cloning process with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did clone my original HD, but not the way I was hoping/expecting.&nbsp; I ended up
 with exactly the same 2 partions ( C &amp; D drives) with both being exactly the same size (adding up to 500 gigs) even though they were on a 1.5TB HD.&nbsp; So, I'm going to format the new HD.&nbsp; That's why I asked my original questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;My question now is: after I
 reformat the 1.5 TB HD and "restore" the saved "system image" of the original partitioned HD to the 1.5GB HD... am I again going to end up with 2 partions (a main C drive &amp; a D data drive)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or just the main "C" drive&nbsp;data image that will have all my programs
 and pictures and music etc?&nbsp;&nbsp;If by chance the "system image" from the original 500GB HD&nbsp;partions the new HD (for the 'D' data files on the old HD) will I be able to control the sizes of the partitions or will they end up just like they are on the 500Gb drive
 and then leaving me with a 3rd partion for the rest of the additional space not used on the new 1.5Tb HD?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to be such a pain, but what I'm wanting to do is get Windows 7 on this new HD with either no partions, or if there has to be a&nbsp;partition for "Data", then I want to be able to use say 1.2Gb for Windows 7 and maybe 3GB or less&nbsp;set aside in a "D" data
 drive...if Windows&nbsp;7 requires such.&nbsp; I'm not sure now whether Acer made that "Data" partion when they installed Vista, or if Windows 7 did it when I upgraded to it???&nbsp; Either way, i want to be able to use the bulk of the HD for&nbsp;Windows 7 and my uses and the
 smallest portion for a "Data" drive if I have to have one.</p>
<p>I appreciate any info and help you can give.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>Actually you have 3 partitions, the first one is hidden (no drive letter assigned) which is actually the System partition (100MB or 200MB) in size. Cloning can sometimes fail to properly recreate the System partition leaving you with an unbootable computer.</p>
<p>Yes, I am saying you can create an Image Backup of the old drive and restore it to the new drive per the artical I posted&nbsp;a link to. However since you have a second partition (D:) used for data things change. Therefore you may want to consider using the
 proceedure I posted for just the System and C: windows partition. Exspand/Extend the Windows partition to the size you want. Then create and format the D: partition and copy the files you backed up (to an external USB drive) from the smaller drive's D: partition
 from the USB drive over to the newly created and formatted D: parition.</p>
<p>Question: Do you use the "Data" partition for anything?</p>
<p>Also suggest before you start to run a test of your new hard drive.</p>

<p>Thanks so much J W for all your help.&nbsp; You asked, "Do you use the "Data" partition for anything?"&nbsp; Answer: Not intentionally...&nbsp;that I'm aware of.&nbsp; I assumed Windows or&nbsp;maybe Acer&nbsp;made it&nbsp;for backing up&nbsp;something, but&nbsp;I would just as soon do away with it
 and have the extra space all on my C: drive.</p>
<p>One last (hopefully) question for you.&nbsp; You&nbsp;mentioned using an external USB drive for&nbsp;storing&nbsp;the backup image.&nbsp; Can't one just as well use a separate internal HD&nbsp;for the same thing?&nbsp; I've already stored&nbsp;my backup image on one of&nbsp;the internal HD's.&nbsp; If I
 have to use an external USB HD now for this operation, I can go buy one of those things I saw at&nbsp;CompUSA (I was planning on buying and using later anyway, where&nbsp;one can plug&nbsp;an internal HD into it and use&nbsp;it&nbsp;as an external HD)&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;do my install/restoration
 operation.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;5&nbsp;internal HD's now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four of which I now&nbsp;have installed internally,&nbsp;(one a 1.0TB with the backup image of the HD I want to replace).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a 500GB regular external Seagate HD, which I was using for backups, but is full now, as the backup programs I used kept duplicating everything in stead of incrementally backing up.&nbsp; Why so many HD's you might ask?&nbsp; Well, because a few years ago
 I lost everything on 2 internal HD's.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm planning on using one or more of the internal HD's&nbsp;as external backup HD's (using that piece of equipment from CompUSA) after I get everything re-situated.</p>

<p>Internal drive will do for a temporary solution, just disconnect it before you install Windows so that you don't accidentally format it during the installation process.</p>
<p>As long as there are no files on the D: partition and it is not a "Recovery" partition used to reinstall Vista then you can eliminate it.</p>
<p>Just remember than should you ever need to completely reinstall Windows 7 (using your "Upgrade" version) it expects to see a prior OS (Vista or XP) installed on the drive.</p>
<p>In this case you are not going to reinstall Windows but move it from one drive to another which will not require that you reactivate Windows.</p>

<p>J W, you got me to thinking with your last reply...&nbsp; Although I see where Windows 7 made a Windows.old folder on my Acer (C:) drive, when I upgraded from Vista, its quite possible that the Data&nbsp;(D:) drive could be as you put it a "Recovery" partition, but
 that makes me wonder then&nbsp;why then Windows 7 would have made the Windows.old folder then???</p>
<p>If the Data (D:) drive is a recovery partion, then I guess it would be prudent not to attempt to eliminate it.&nbsp; I can live with that, as long as Windows 7 will allow me to control the Data (D:) drive's size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I think I said&nbsp;at the beginning of all this, my rationale for taking on this task is because right now&nbsp;my computer's&nbsp;Seagate 500GB HD&nbsp;Acer (C:) drive size is 232GB, of which 207GB&nbsp;is&nbsp;in use&nbsp;and the (Data) D: drive size&nbsp;is 348GB, of which only 85.6 GB&nbsp;is&nbsp;used.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
 you can see I'm running out of space on my Acer&nbsp;(C:) drive.&nbsp; That's the reason for wanting to move Windows 7&nbsp;to my new 1.5TB Western Digital HD.&nbsp; But I don't want Windows 7 to assign the C: &amp; D: drives' space proportionally to what they are now on the Seagate,
 on the larger Western Digital HD.&nbsp; Can you tell me&nbsp;whether or not I will&nbsp;be able to assign each partion's size on the new 1.5TB HD during/before the "Restoration" process?&nbsp; Or, if&nbsp;Windows 7 won't allow me to assign&nbsp;the alloted space to each partition&nbsp;on the
 new 1.5TB HD, (because they will be in porportion to what they are&nbsp;on the 500GB Seagate HD) then is there any way before hand to reapportion the existing Seagate HD partion sizes to give the (C:)&nbsp;partition a larger portion of space by reducing the size&nbsp;of
 the&nbsp;Data (D:) partition?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Windows.old folder was created when you upgrade to Windows 7 and this folder has two purposes. 1) Contains all your personal data files that were presrnt when you were using Vista. 2) Allows you to unistall Windows 7 and return to Vista. So keep it,
 at least for now.</p>
<p>If the DATA (D:) drive is a recovery partition I would also keep it, although its unusual for a recovery partition to be assigned a drive letter (D: in your case) and to be so large (348GB). You should double check to see exactly whats on this partition.</p>
<p>Windows 7's Backup and Restore is somewhat limited in functionallity as you know doubt read in my article about extending the C: partition after moving to a larger drive. Your problem is the when you restore the backup to the new drive the partition size
 will be the same size as they were on the old drive. In order to be able to increase the size of the C: partition you then need to move the D partition towards the end of the drive so there is "Unallocated" space immediatly after the C: partition to allow
 'Disk Management' to extend/expand the C: partition into the unallocated space.</p>
<p>To resize and move the partitions on the new drive (after you restore Windows) you will need a third party partition management utility such as Partition Wizard:<a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html</a></p>
<p>Or Easeus Partition Master: <a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm</a></p>
<p>Remember to include that small hidden "System" partition as part of the image backup.</p>

<p>JW, sorry, but I'm back again...&nbsp; I've got to be either doing something wrong or have something setup wrong.&nbsp; I reformated&nbsp;my 1.5TB disk to get everything off of it.&nbsp; Then I reformatted a 1.0TB drive I had used before&nbsp;for storing&nbsp;my system image and created
 a new&nbsp;system image on it.&nbsp; Then I turned off my computer, disconnected my regular C: drive that I made the system image from.&nbsp; At that point I only had the two HD's connected.&nbsp; The 1.5TB I want to move Wondows 7 to and a 1.0TB that I saved the system image
 to.&nbsp; I turned on the computer, set it boot on my Repair Disc (Windows 7 64bit) and the Repair disk loaded just like its supposed to.&nbsp; I went through the System Recovery steps. Got to the step where I selected "Restore you computer using a system image that
 you created earlier." Clicked on Next.&nbsp; 'Select System Image Backup' box came up showing the date of the image I just made.&nbsp; I clicked on next and get to "Choose additional restore options".&nbsp; There is nothing there I need to select so I click on Next again
 until it tells me that its going to resotre the image and that anything on the disk its restoring the image to will be lost etc. etc.&nbsp; I click Next and it&nbsp;starts the process, then stops&nbsp;and gives me this error... "The system image restore failed.&nbsp; Error details:
 A data disk is currently set as active in BIOS. Set some other disk as active or use the DISKPART utility to clean the data, and then retry the restore operation. (0x80042406)&nbsp;&nbsp; I got another box named Re-image your computer.&nbsp; It says: "No disk that can be
 used for recoverying the system disk can be found.&nbsp; Try the following: 1) A probable system disk may have been excluded by mistake.&nbsp; a. Review the list of disks that you have excluded from recovery for a likely disk.&nbsp; b. Type List Disk Command in the DISKPART
 command interpreter.&nbsp; The probable system disk is usually the first disk from the exclusion list in the results.&nbsp; c. If possible, remove the disk from the exclusion list and then retry the recovery.&nbsp; 2) AUSB disk may have been assigned as a system disk.&nbsp; a.
 Detach all USB disks fromthe computer.&nbsp; b. Reboot into Windows Recovery Enviroment (Win RE), then reattach the USB disks and retry the recovery.&nbsp; 3) An invalid disk may have been assigned as system disk.&nbsp; a. Physically&nbsp;detach the disk from your computer.&nbsp;
 Then reboot into Win RE to retry recovery. (0x80042412)&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing.&nbsp; When I created the system image it didn't try to include the (Data) D: drive, only the C: drive.&nbsp; From what I can tell and see on the (data) D drive there isn't any system image, just junk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if you can tell me&nbsp;what I'm doing wrong and what I need to fix or change so I can get this thing finshed???</p>

<p>Boot from the Partition Wizard CD and it should display the current state of both the drive you plan to restore the image to and the drive the image is stored on.</p>
<p>Which if any drive is marked as 'active' and or 'System'?</p>
<p>Is the 1.5TB formatted or not.</p>
<p>Also with the Partition Wizard CD removed from the DVD drive, reboot and during the boot process if the an option (F key)to select which drive to from?</p>

            <p>Are you using a laptop with a touchpad?&nbsp; Many touchpads these days come with "multi-touch" on them, so that you can pinch two fingers to zoom in and out (similar to a smart phone).&nbsp; Unfortunately many touchpads are also so sensitive that they think they
 detect a second finger even if you don't mean to do it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can open your touchpad settings and either adjust the sensitivity, or turn off the gesture for zooming entirely.&nbsp; Since all different companies build touchpads, the settings are always in different places.&nbsp; But you can try looking to see if they put
 it inside the Mouse options first. Here's a quick way:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" /><strong>+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>main.cpl</strong> and press OK to open Mouse Properties.</p>
<p>Look for touchpad settings.&nbsp; If you don't find any, try going to the hardware tab, select the touchpad in the list and then choose Settings to open it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If still none, you might need to contact your manufacturer to ask them where they decided to put the options for their model.</p>

            <p>Make sure your printer is powered on and Wi-Fi connects. Then power up PC.</p>
<p>Start&gt;Settings&gt;Devices and Printers&gt;Add Printer</p>
<p>Install recommended HP Printer App. Start&gt;All Apps&gt;HP AIO APP</p>
<p>Configure it. Swipe over and on the right you'll see several selection buttons. Choose to install HP Full Software. Do that and follow the on screen directions. You will note that it is the same software on HP CD. Once you are done configuring the Full HP
 software, Just simply right click on the HP AIO APP and uninstall. You should be good to go after that. I have the HP 6520 and this worked well for me. It may work for you as well.</p>
<p>By the way, make sure that all your PC drivers are installed and working. Device Manager should show you what is or is not installed. You may have to reinstall updated PC drivers after the Windows 10 upgrade. Many are forgetting this step. Then the above
 should work. Cheers!!</p>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard not working on Windows 7</h2>
                    <br />
<br />
So first of all i am using Windows 7 and everything funcioned normally for like 3 months up untill now. Windows updated itself sometime in the night and restarted... in the morning i shut the computer completely off and came back in the evening, i booted the
 computer up and it started normally but to my amazement when i tried to move my mouse it didnt move, it was completely frozen.. it was a logitec wireless mouse + keyboard set. and yeah my keyboard didnt work either. i tried restarting my computer and restarting
 the mouse/keyboard but nothing. the wierd thing is that clearly the keyboard and mouse are funcional because i plugged them in to my laptop and it works fine. In the black screen, when you power down your computer by holding down the power button, the error
 screen where it gives you to option to start the computer in safe mode or in normal mode i can use my keyboard to navigate and choose which mode i want to start teh computer in. when choosing normal mode windows starts up normally but again the mouse and keyboard
 both dont work. And the same problem in safemode aswell, i tried to do everything in tthe menues before you startup windows but nothing works. mouse and keyboard just wont work when windows is operational.<br />
<br />
at the moment i have tried everything i could think of, i read this whole forum but nothing works, and since i cant use my keyboard aswell i cant navigate at all to get the mouse working.<br />
<br />
i have tried using a keyboard with a corde and another mouse aswell but the same problem as with the wireless mouse/keyboard. Can anyone help me with this problem? it seems that i cant do nothing and this is a 1200 euro gaming computer with 6 cores ... i would
 like to get it back working

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you connect the USB or PS/2 keyboard (Wired)?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When did you install the Windows Updates?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there multiple updates installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Try using a PS/2 keyboard/mouse to check for the issue. (if available)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Since you are unable to use the devices even in safe mode, I would suggest that you perform a system restore and see if it helps. This will also help us know the updates that were installed
 as they will be offered again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try performing a system restore from WinRe (Windows Recovery Environment)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key
 when the Boot Menu appears.</span></p>

            I'm not in a situation to need OneDrive, which is why I had to rely on the quote.  My understanding is that you should be able to open the file in the OneDrive location on your HD, without going to OneDrive. That is supposed to happen in the background.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't transfer a Windows 10 license on a new computer if it's digital license because it&nbsp;is linked with your current hardware on the licensing server. You can only use the digital license to reactivate the&nbsp;system&nbsp;if you made a significant hardware change
 by using the Activation troubleshooter.</p>

            No, you can't. Presumably Windows came preinstalled on your laptop, and that makes it an OEM version. The biggest disadvantage of an OEM version is that its license is permanently tied to the first computer it's installed on. It may never be moved to anther.<br />

    <title>Wordpad document made contents invisible after crash - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wordpad document made contents invisible after crash</h2>
                    My laptop froze and crashed. At the time I had a Wordpad document open. I rebooted the computer and went to open the document once more.
<br />
The file still exists and in the description is shows the file size as '267 kb', just as I left it.<br />
But here is the problem: It's like all the words were replaced with spaces. I can scroll down but it's just white. I can highlight but there are no words. The font is set to black, so it's not just that the text has gone white. It's invisible.
<br />
There is page upon page of blank space.<br />
<br />
This has happened before but it erased everything and took it down to 0 kb.<br />
In this case it says there is something still in there, 267 kb worth of stuff still in there.<br />
<br />
I have been working on this file for over a year and I would try ANYTHING to get the contents back.<br />
<br />
I have tried copying and pasting it into numerous duplicate files, emailing the file to myself in an attachment.. all of that. I'm out of ideas.<br />
What happened and is there any way to recover what was written in the file?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, check the type of license installed on your system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Open administrative Command Prompt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Type slmgr /dlv and press Enter key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Note the Product Key Channel section Windows Script Host box:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it mentions OEM &lt;method&gt;, you’ve OEM license installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it says Retail, you’ve retail license installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it mentions GVLK, VOLUME_&lt;method&gt; then you’ve volume license installed. Note that GVLK stands for Generic Volume License Key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Retail license users facing this issue, run Activation troubleshooter:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/20527/windows-10-activation-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/20527/windows-10-activation-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Contact Microsoft Support or license vendor, if issue still persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In case if it reports that you've volume license installed,&nbsp;then it is not a valid&nbsp;license&nbsp;to be used by end users (correct me, if your system is part of organization).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In this case, you need to buy genuine license for your Windows 10.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>My install of the update "got stuck" at 32%.&nbsp; But it was not really "stuck."&nbsp; I launched Task Manager and it showed high disk usage (nearly 100%).&nbsp;I selected the Performance tab, and then clicked on Open Resource Monitor (at bottom of window).&nbsp; In the Overview
 page, click on the Disk bar to see the current disk activity.&nbsp; I selected the "Total" column for sorting.&nbsp; Turns out that SetupHost.exe was reading a large number of files on my hard disk.&nbsp; In fact it might have read every file.&nbsp; I have symbols installed for
 Windows 10 (for debugging during development) and SetupHost.exe was reading all the symbol files.&nbsp; Later it was reading a lot of the files in the "C:\Program Files (x86)" directory tree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see similar disk activity, just be patient and let the setup continue (don't reboot the machine).&nbsp; Eventually, the installer restarted the machine and got me to the standard plain Windows Update screen ("copying files", "installing drivers", "finishing"
 progress controls).&nbsp; Understand that this is effectively a new install of an OS; it is not a simple 1-minute Windows update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a couple of problems when the OS finished installing.&nbsp; Firstly, after opening Microsoft Outlook 2016, after about 20 seconds my monitors went black and were receiving no signals from the computer.&nbsp; It might be that my graphics card driver was updated
 during the install.&nbsp; A reboot fixed that problem.&nbsp; Secondly, opening Microsoft Outlook 2016 again, I got the blue Outlook window with "Starting..." or "Processing..." but Outlook never launched.&nbsp; Rebooting did not fix this.&nbsp; I created a new Outlook Profile
 (via Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts -&gt; Mail), after which Outlook 2016 was successful in launching.</p>

            I just did the update for 2 PC's. It hung at 32% for about 7 minutes and then again at 90% for about 10 minutes. I was just patient and let it run and it continued on it's own. Full installation completed for both in about an hour. Not sure if this helps,
 but unless it hangs for a few hours, I'd just wait it out.

<p>Why is there a red slash through my icon in Live Messenger as if it is blocked. Block &amp; Unblock are not options for myself. I have removed Live Essentials and re-installed it and still have the problem. Also, I do not know what kind of problems this could
 cause, nothing that I can tell so far, it's just annoying.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Chris.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center&#58; program guide not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorpam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center&#58; program guide not updating</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is my first post here.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that someone can help with the Windows (7) Media Center electronic program guide. For a couple of weeks now, it has not updated properly. We're getting updates for the local HD channels only -- nothing for standard-def local channels or for the
 regular cable channels.</p>
<p>I've tried a variety of methods to get MCUPDATE.EXE to completely update the EPG, but nothing has worked. The most "promising" indication we've had (in terms of a hint as to what's going on) is that, sometimes, we get the error message "Failed to retrieve
 updates (Error: HeadendID [eight-digit number] is invalid.)"</p>
<p>I tried contacting Zap2It and they referred me to Microsoft, that's how I ended up here. The procedure for reporting an EPG problem is not exactly crystal-clear, so please bear with me if I've done something wrong. (Zap2It gave me a link to&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site1145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://connect.microsoft.com/site1145</a>,
 but when I click on "the feedback link to the left" as the page suggests, it simply takes me right back to the same page.)</p>
<p>If it helps to have this information, we're on Comcast and using a CableCARD in a Ceton InfiniTV 4 PCI-E tuner. We can watch all the channels we're subscribing to, and we can record them manually, but there is no program metadata and we can't do series recordings
 on cable. Please let me know what I need to do to report this to someone who is in a position to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>I tried that (changing Zip codes) last night, one of many new things I did. I selected the nearest town that wasn't ours, and got an unfamiliar set of&nbsp;guides to choose from. Selected one of them, and downloaded it -- but of course the channels didn't match.</p>
<p>We finally had success when I risked re-running the TV setup; my fear was that we might have to re-pair the CableCARD all over again, which is a major pain as some cable company CSRs have never even heard of it, let alone know what to do about it. So going
 through TV setup was like a last-resort measure for me.</p>
<p>But I learned that one can just accept the existing CableCARD information in WMC and go on one's merry way. We finished the setup process, inputting the correct Zip code once again -- and this time we got not only all the right channels, but also 12 days'
 worth of listings!</p>
<p>So I'll add re-running TV setup to our "protocol" in case we ever run into this issue again. There is great relief in our home!</p>

<p>
Office numbers / landlines sometimes show up as 'mobile' - I have been trying to change this manually, but this seems extremely difficult (!) - in the old Skype all of this was so much easier. Could you please let me know how to do this? - if at all possible.<br /></p>

<h3> ebwolfie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Repair Disk does not recognice external usb 3.0 drive. Works OK on USB 2.0</h2>
                    <p>Have a 1 TB USB 3.0 External Drive. It is connected to a USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use it for backups using the Windows back up utility in Win 7. I have no problem making the backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a Windows Repair Disk to boot I am unable to see the External Drive if it is connected on the USB 3.0. However, I move it to a USB 2.0 port then it sees it and works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing that the Repair Disk does not have a USb 3.0 driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this so that it recognizes USB 3.0 port?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Missing sptip.dll.mui file&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelbresler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing sptip.dll.mui file&#63; </h2>
                    I recently had a system crash, and Windows automatically checked the C drive upon rebooting. I believe there was an issue with the sptip.dl.mui file. I cannot find such a file on my system now. So I am wondering: (1) do I need this file, (2) if so, where
 can I get it from a trustworthy source and (3) where does it go once I have it.

<p><span>Hi JoelBresler,</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s first understand what
<strong>Check disk </strong>is, </span><strong><span>CHKDSK</span></strong><span>
 (short for <strong>Checkdisk</strong>) is a command on computers running windows operating system that
<strong>displays file integrity status </strong>of hard drive and can <strong>
fix logical file system errors.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>CHKDSK
</span></strong><span>scans the computer automatically if integrity violations are found.</span></p>
<p><span>To answer to your questions:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Yes, those are system files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>CHKDSK will automatically fix them; you don’t have to download them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Corrupted files are repaired by
<strong>CHKDSK</strong> or <strong>SFC (</strong></span><strong><span>system file checker)</span></strong><span>
 scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps to fix the errors:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Run CHKDSK again and make sure automatically fix file system errors is selected.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right-click the hard disk drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check Now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select automatically fix file system errors.</span></strong><span>
 Otherwise, the disk check will simply report problems but not fix them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a thorough disk check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on
 the hard disk itself, and it can take much longer to complete. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both
<strong>Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>The system file checker (SFC) utility allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should
 find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a SFC scan on the windows vista computer. To run a SFC scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area
 and then click on run as administrator. </span></p>
<p><span>b. at the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
