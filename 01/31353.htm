    <title>Dongles will not connect PC to the internet. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dongles will not connect PC to the internet.</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 7 Professional edition (x64) on my other partition, and I'm having trouble configuring my wireless dongles. I thought this'd be the best place to ask for some advice.<br />
<br />
I have the Hawkings HWU54G dongle, and the WL-685Z WiFi max dongle. Both work with my Windows Vista Home premium 32-bit. I installed the CD Driver for the Wifi Max, and also tried an online driver to no avail. I also tried a HWU54G driver from softpedia.com
 which does not work either.<br />
<br />
Devices and Drivers states that the USB port I plugged my dongles into is Unknown and does not detect them in the network adapters page.
<br />
<br />
Long story short, do I need to buy a new wireless adapter for my computer? Should I get a PCI Card instead? If I were to buy a PCI card to work with Vista and Windows 7, which is the most ideal card for this? (I have an HP a6452f (lol I know) http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/ho/WF06b/12132708-12133156-12133158-12133158-12133158-81670277-<br />
81959216.html<br />
<br />
Sorry if I come off as a noob concerning this topic, but I am lol. Any help is appreciated.

<p>Hi TailsKun,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;What is the exact error message?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As suggested try plugging the Dongles into a different USB port and check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows operating system might not find a network adapter for which drivers have been installed and enabled if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information provided to the driver about the network adapter is incorrect. </li><li>The network adapter is not physically present. </li><li>The network adapter has experienced a hardware failure. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Verify the status of the Network Adapter in Device Manager:</strong></p>
<p>To perform this procedure, you must have membership in Administrators, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.</p>
<p>To use Device Manager to view the status of network adapters:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type devmgmt.msc in Start Search, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<strong> Network adapters</strong> in the Device Manager tree, and then verify that the network adapter is present.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the network adapter, and then click <strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device Status should indicate: <strong>This device is working properly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Replace or reconfigure the network adapter:<br />
</strong><br />
Move the network adapter to a different PCI slot. If moving the network adapter does not fix the problem, you might need to replace the network adapter with a new one and then update the driver.<br />
<br />
To perform this procedure, you must have membership in Administrators, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.<br />
<br />
To use Device Manager to update the network adapter driver:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start, type devmgmt.msc in Start Search, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand<strong> Network Adapters.<br />
</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the network adapter, and then click<strong> Properties-&gt;</strong>Under<strong> Driver
</strong>tab<strong> click Update Driver</strong>.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the steps in the Update Driver wizard.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m having Bluetooth issues with the Marvel BT card in Surface Book 2.</h2>
                    <p>What is happen Bluetooth is being turned off and the on/off switch is not available after it turns off. My bluetooth mouse doesn't work and says Bluetooth turned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In device manager i uninstalled Marvell BT and said search for new devices and it reinstalls the driver.</p>
<p>2. Tried to update driver and it says I have the most current.</p>
<p>3. Ran the troubleshoot under Update and selected Bluetooth and ran and got the message fixed and the mouse started working. Then I left the PC on went I went to work. When I came home the mouse didn't. When I did the Troubleshoot again I got the message
 wasn't fixed may be a problem with driver. If I restarted and did the troubleshoot again it would say fixed and the mouse would work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Also i went into the Device Manager under bluetooth went to Marvel and unchecked the box Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power and that didn't help.</p>

<p>Hi Orlbuckeye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Book 2 supports Bluetooth Wireless 4.1 technology. Bluetooth 3.0 and later devices should be able to work properly with the Surface Book 2. First, let's check if the power plan puts any services to sleep. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> &gt; <strong>Additional power settings</strong> &gt; click on
<strong>Change plan settings</strong> for the power plan in use &gt; check if any setting limits or suspends your wireless connections. Next, while the Bluetooth is on, try to remove the mouse from the list of paired Bluetooth devices. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices</strong> &gt; select the mouse &gt;
<strong>Remove </strong>&gt; <strong>Yes</strong>. Afterwards, pair the mouse again to refresh the Bluetooth driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit to verify that you are running the recommended driver and firmware updates. It will also check for other software issues that may be affecting the connection between your Surface Book 2 and Bluetooth
 mouse. For more information and to download the tool, go <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. After running
 the SDT, perform a forced shutdown. Just press the power button for about 10 seconds. As the device restarts, it would apply the updates and reload the software properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure the mouse has sufficient battery charge. Try replacing the batteries or connect the mouse to the host PC if the mouse is rechargeable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no changes, then we may need to reset the Surface to eliminate software issues. Download a recovery image for your Surface Book 2 to reset Windows. Make sure that you back up your files since the tool will remove all your personal files that
 are currently stored on the device. Refer to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></strong> for more information about the process.
 Once understood, go <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to download a recovery image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting Windows, attempt to pair your mouse once again and check if the connection will still be interrupted. If you continue to experience the problem, then you may need to get a replacement for the Bluetooth mouse. If what you have is a Microsoft
 Bluetooth Mouse, please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Support</a></strong> or take the device to a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong> to get further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions, please reply to this post.</p>

<h2>            Xbox startar, men ingen bild </h2>
                    
<p>Finns det nÃ¥gon hÃ¤r som har problem med sitt Xbox One? Vi kÃ¶pte det november/december och har haft det inne pÃ¥ service 1 gÃ¥ng, vi fick tillbaka det fÃ¶r ca 2 veckor sen. Anledningen till det var att vi kÃ¶pte spelet Unravel pÃ¥ Xboxstore, spelet hÃ¤ngde sig
 efter ca 10 sekunder, vi provade att stÃ¤nga av hela konsolen med kontrollen men det fungerade inte sÃ¥ vi fick tvÃ¥ngs stÃ¤nga av det och sedan gick det inte igÃ¥ng nÃ¥got mer. Spelet startade men vi fick ingen bild pÃ¥ TV:n. Efter att vi fick tillbaka den frÃ¥n
 service/reperation hittades inget fel pÃ¥ konsolen, tvÃ¥ dagar senare hÃ¤nder samma sak igen, men dÃ¥ kom spelet igÃ¥ng efter att vi har dragit ur ALLA kablar (fick vÃ¤nta ca 20min innan vi kopplade ihop det igen). Sen dess har det fungerat felfritt, tills idag.
 Idag gÃ¥r spelet inte igÃ¥ng, vi fÃ¥r ingen bild oavsett hur vi gÃ¶r. NÃ¥gon som har en blekaste aning om vad det kan vara eller har samma problem?</p>

</p><p>My ios-version is 11.2.5 (15D60), I think that is the latest version. </p>

<h2>            My Windows 10 Toshiba laptop says the browser &#34;cannot connect with the server&#34;.</h2>
                    As the heading says my machine "cannot connect with the server". It worked perfectly for approx 12 days after Windows 10 was installed then for no good reason stopped. I use Mozilla and this had not been a problem previously. My iPad and older Acer using
 Vista both connect with no difficulty, it seems to be just Windows 10 that has this issue. It seems that quite a few other users are experiencing similar problems when I search online. Any helpful advice gratefully accepted!

            <p>Is this a wireless or an Ethernet (wired) connection from your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Dell laptop I find that the wireless connection does not connect at times.&nbsp; The quickest fix is to disable and re-enable the adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find this easily, hold the Windows key and type the letter X.&nbsp; Then type the letter W.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Right-click the Start button at the bottom left and when a menu pops up type the letter W.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a list of network adapters.&nbsp; If you right-click the one you are using (wireless or Ethernet) a menu will appear. Choose Disable.&nbsp; Wait a moment until it is disabled (it will turn grey)&nbsp;and right-click it again to choose Enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The connection should be restored and work again.&nbsp; I find that this happens sometimes after powering up my laptop with its wireless adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't resolve why it is happening, but it may be a quick resolution when it does happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why, I wonder if it has anything to do with power management settings of the adapter.&nbsp; Windows 10 may have trouble working with restoring the previous state of the adapter if power saving affects it, especially if this is using older, pre-Windows-10
 drivers, or even if new windows 10 drivers have not yet been optimized to work right or need to be revised by Microsoft or the manufacturer.</p>

            <p>When this happens, please run the Windows Network Diagnostics trouble shooter and let us know what it reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to find and run it is to click on the start button, have it search for "troubleshooting", and pick the top item in the results. &nbsp;In the window that displays, under "Network and Internet", click on "Connect to the Internet". &nbsp;In the window that displays,
 click on Advanced at the bottom and click on "Run as administrator", and then click on Next. &nbsp;In the window that displays, click on "Troubleshoot my connection to the internet". &nbsp;Report the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way, if the three left facing quarter circles of the wireless network connection icon appear on the right side of your taskbar, right click that icon and then click on "Troubleshoot problems".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I mentioned in my last message in the other thread, information on your wireless adapter would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, what do you have to do the get around the problem? - wait a while and it goes away, wait a minute or two and it goes away, disconnect and reconnect to the network, restart the computer, etc.&nbsp;</p>

            I managed to solve most of the problem by adjusting the firewall settings on Bitdefender Internet Security as shown on their website. Then by attempting to add a user to my role as Administrator (which I couldn't achieve) I set a PIN as password. Not expecting
 much I was amazed when the system started to operate, connecting with the browser etc! The problem remaining is that I am unable to send and receive emails but I can leave that for now. After Windows 10 fired up again I had to download various apps as they
 had disappeared. I must give credit to my Son in the U.S. (Works in IT) who tried valiantly to help via iMessage and photos using my iPad. Not easy and relations are a bit strained now, to say the least! After all he has work and family to consider but I digress......
 Main thing is the system is working again by dint of tweaking Bitdefender and adding a PIN - no idea why but very relieved!

            <p>I'm not being a wiseguy, but a little thing that may spare a lot of grief, check that the laptop is not in flight mode.</p>
<p>If so, turn it off and restart. Good feeling especially after wrestling the problem overnight!<br />

    <title>Laptop USB ports not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> augster8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop USB ports not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been battling this for some time and I definitely need help as all the options I've found on the internet haven't worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an old HP zv6203cl laptop.&nbsp; When I plus USB devices in, I eventually get the error, "USB Device not recognized, Device has malfunctioned" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the USB tree in Devmgmt it just shows as an unknown device with no driver.&nbsp; There is power getting the USB after boot, but as the OS loads, the power dies.&nbsp; For example, I use my optical USB mouse.&nbsp; While it is rebooting and posting the optical light
 is on and looks good.&nbsp; After the "Welcome" screen the light goes out on the USB mouse then after everything loads I get the error as the OS is trying to load the USB device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem happened when I had XP home (SP3)&nbsp;on it.&nbsp; So I figured putting in a new OS would fix it.&nbsp; I formatted and installed XP Pro 64-bit (SP2).&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp; I tried the "remove the battery and unplug it for 48 hours" with no change.&nbsp; I've checked
 the registry and the common registry value that some recommend to set to "1" is already set to "1".&nbsp; Other fixes include going into device manager and setting the power management tab for each hub to allow power all the time, but I don't have that option in
 my power tab in device manager in the USB Hubs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be great.&nbsp; I currently run the computer without the battery in it and only on AC as the battery doesn't charge anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and any questions just ask.</p>

            Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Try uinstalling those USB ports in the Device Manager and click on Scan for HardWare Changes. It will automatically install the driver for that USB.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also scan your computer with RadarSync to find the outdated drivers (USB) and it will show suggestions.&nbsp;</div>

            David,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had done that in the past, but I tried it again tonight. &nbsp;Same deal. &nbsp;I uninstall everything in devmgmt under USB, then I reboot and it finds and installs all the USB hubs with no problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also went into Safe mode and uninstalled all the USB devices and they reinstalled just fine. &nbsp;Yet no USB devices work. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem is really kicking my butt. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The radarsync program is nice to find all of my updated drivers, but it seems I'd have to buy the program to use it most efficiently. &nbsp;I've searched the net for drivers that it shows are updated, but finding drivers on the net seems next to impossible
 with all the fake download sites.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other help is greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

            So today I took a shot in the dark and opened up the laptop and reset the CMOS. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>No change. &nbsp;Laptop is back together.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I plug the optical mouse into any USB port, the light on the mouse goes bright red, then dim red, then off, then the error comes up about malfunctioning device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"USB Device not recognized.</div>
<div>One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it. &nbsp;For assistance in solving this problem, click the message. "</div>
<div><br />
<div>It wants to kick to Microsoft's "Fix it" program, but that doesn't work on XP I guess. &nbsp;Or maybe just x64 XP? &nbsp;I don't know.</div>

            <p>Nobody has a cure for this at all?&nbsp; A registry tweak?&nbsp; Something?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My last attempt to fix this will involve buying another laptop battery.&nbsp; I really didn't want to do this with a computer this old if the USB ports aren't working.&nbsp; But the USB ports only recently locked out as the battery finally gave out and refuses to
 charge.&nbsp; I don't know what one will have to do with the other, and I doubt they are related, but it's something.&nbsp; I just don't want to throw more money at a 9 year old machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if anyone has anything I can try.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Ctrl &#43; Alt &#43; Del no longer refreshes the display connection</h2>
                    <p>Under Win7, 8, and 10 prior to a couple months ago, pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del would refresh the display connection along with bringing up the Lock/Switch User/Sign out/ Task Manager screen. &nbsp;I would generally see this as a quick blanking of the monitor.
 &nbsp;This was useful to me because occasionally, my main computer will lose sync with my KVM switch when I'm on the other computer. &nbsp;Pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del on my Win 10 box would reset the DVI connection and everything was fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of sometime a couple months ago, pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del stopped refreshing the display connection. &nbsp;I can perform a refresh using the KVM switch, but it also resets the display on my other computer too which messes up all of my open windows on that
 machine. &nbsp;That's an annoyance, but really the concern is why Ctrl + Alt + Del stopped performing this rather basic function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a command line command that can force a display connection refresh? &nbsp;I could possibly put it in a batch file and launch it without needing the display working.</p>

            <p>No, I am not connected to a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already stated, Ctrl + Alt + Del no longer refreshes the display connection. &nbsp;This is not the same thing as refreshing the desktop or active window, which is what happens when you press F5. &nbsp;I'm talking about the handshake between the graphics adapter
 and the monitor. &nbsp;Previously, when I pressed Ctrl + Alt + Del, my screen would briefly blank as if the connection had been interrupted. &nbsp;In fact, that was exactly what was happening. &nbsp;The connection would briefly reset and the graphics adapter and monitor
 would re-handshake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior still exists in Windows 7 (which is what the second computer connected to my KVM switch is running.) &nbsp;It existed in Windows 10 up until a month or two ago too. &nbsp;I don't know if it was changed due to a recent Windows update or what, but I want
 it back, or an easy way to reset the connection via Command Prompt.</p>

            This is still an issue, though I have found a physical workaround. &nbsp;As it turns out, physically unplugging the cable from my KVM and plugging it back in will force the graphics adapter and the monitor to re-establish communication. &nbsp;This is kind of a pain
 to do, though. &nbsp;Relying on Ctrl + Alt + Del's display reset definitely made things easier when this happens.

    <title>Pre Order Nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chadamis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pre Order Nightmare</h2>
                    
<p>I had a horrible pre order experience through Best Buy. I have been trying to get in contact with Microsoft vial email which I have deemed impossible so this is where my rant is going. I am including my email complaint to Best Buy in this. This is in no
 way Microsofts fault, but I was seriously considering just picking up a PS4 so I though that this concerns them.</p>
<div>I had the worst pre-order experience of my life last night for the Xbox One midnight pre-order release. We had pre-ordered the Day One Console, the first day available to do so. A month later we received an email explaining there was a problem verifying
 our payment. When we called we were told Everything looked in order and there was nothing wrong with the purchase. Then on monday we received another email stating the same thing. When we went online to verify the order it said that your records did not show
 our email on file. We then called again, and again was told there was no problem with our account, and was assured we would not have a problem picking up our order at midnight last night. Thursday morning my friend receives an email conformation that his order
 was ready to pick up and so I went to check the order status online, and again was unable to log on to verify my order saying there is no record of my account, or order number. I called again, and again was assured there was no problem with the order or the
 payment, which is a best buy card with plenty of balance. I even called the store and verified that I was on the pre-order list. I arrived at the store in_______________, at 10:30pm and got in line. At around 11:30pm I was told we could go inside and pay for
 the pre-order to expedite pick up. During payment they could not verify our pre-order, they told us to wait outside for a manager. When the "General Manager"&nbsp;_____ came to us, we were understandably upset. He refused to help us, and told us that we would not
 be helped until eveyone else in line at least 60 people (Including non-pre orders) were taken care of. He told us we could wait in the non pre order line and hope they had a console for us, or after 8 days any pre orders not picked up could be sold to us.
 This was obviously unacceptable due to the fact that we pre ordered a DAY ONE edition. We waited until everyone had been taken care of and then another 15 min. went by and we knocked on the glass doors, and was told they were working on it, and let us inside
 out of the cold. Eventually a lady named _____, not sure of her position came to help us and while trying to help us _____ pulled her away to do something else. When she got back to us she told us that she could cancel our order and sell us the Day One edition
 right now. We told her that money had already been taken out of our card, but she told us her records did not indicate that. Luckily we had enough balance that we could handle a second charge, and decided to cancel our order and buy one which seemed very simple
 and reasonable, and we could not figure out why it took so long for a solution. We decided we wanted the console and we would deal with the double charge another day. We were also told by several sales staff to never pre-order online, and to do it in store
 to assure we dont run into this problem in the future, which will not be a problem because we will never be using Best Buy as our pre-order headquarters again. And I will never be shopping at the Signal Hill store as long as I know_______is the manager. We
 were looking forward to this so much, and this has ruined our taste for shopping in store.</div>

<p>I was going to walk out of that store with a next gen console. I hadn't planned on getting a ps4 at all because I hated the ps3. Last week though my buddy picked one up and I actually really enjoyed it. If bestbuy couldn't get me the console I ordered I
 was going to pick up another one. My local gamestop had a few left in stock. </p>

<p>The only thing I don't understand is what you expect MS to do about it.</p>
<p>The whole issue was caused by Best Buy not MS.</p>
<p>If it's just a place to vent then I'm all for that cos some things in this world really take the p*** but just don't expect MS to be able to fix a problem they havent caused.</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Apps Troubleshooter </strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run the Apps Troubleshooter</a></strong>&nbsp;and check if the issue persists.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: System Restore</strong></p>
<p>If that doesn't help, perform a system restore and check if it helps. </p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you are still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: New user account</strong></p>
<p>In order to identify if this is a user account related issue, I would suggest you to try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Set up Accounts</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Repair upgrade </strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists, try performing a repair upgrade using an installation media. Repair upgrade is done when the system starts causing different issues. It will not delete or remove your personal files and installed applications. To perform the repair
 upgrade, follow the steps given by Andre Da Costa on <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">How
 to: perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have any third party security software installed in the computer, temporarily disable it and check again.
</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer
 against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.

<h2>            Windows Defender virus periodic scanning keeps turning off</h2>
                    <p>I set&nbsp;Windows Defender virus periodic scanning to on. However, it keeps turning off, without giving me any notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to keep it on? Or, at the very least, get a notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only started after a very recent Windows Update. I always install Updates immediately, in order to have the very latest security fixes. So, I'm not amused when it seems to lead to weakening security.</p>

            Hi  Harold
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It could be an issue related to the following:
<br />
<br />- There might be Malware on the system
<br />- The edition of Windows 10 you are running: Pro or Enterprise might be managed by your organizations system administrator.
<br />- You might need to reinstall Windows Defender using the steps below. 
<br />- A repair upgrade might by required to fix it.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Enable Windows Defender:
<br />Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SecurityHealthService
<br />
<br />and modify the Start value from 4 to 2. Restart your computer to re-enable the Windows Defender Security Center Service.
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Defender Antivirus
<br />Double click it
<br />Set its Start up type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Option 3:
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableRoutinelyTakingAction /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware 
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />If this does not resolve the problem, then you need to perform a repair upgrade. See steps:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />

<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />

<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />

            Hi Harold.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2</a>...
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t</a>... 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Harold<br /><br />It is possible<br /><br />I would recommend that you perform a repair upgrade. This will reinstall Windows, fully repairing and errors such as registry corruption, while allowing you to keep your files and apps<br /><br />The following guide will show you how to do that<br /><br /> <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<p>Andrre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows hasn't done an update since I last restarted Defender, it is still on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of your options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: the Start value is now 3! Go figure ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2: Startup is now Automatic. Presumably my turning it on through Windows Security set it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done any of the others, as my problem is fixed... for now.</p>

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mean to be difficult, but I can't say any response was helpful to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were answers that might be helpful to other people, in terms of telling people how to turn Defender back on, but I knew how to do that before hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's avoiding the hassle of constantly checking that it STAYS on - and the security risk when it goes off - that are my issues. No response addressed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, Defender seems to be staying on, but I will immediately check after another Windows Update.&nbsp; I have had problems after each recent one. If it weren't for fear of missing a security update, I would turn automatic&nbsp; updates off.<br />

<br />If you just want to clear the drive of data, before discarding the drive
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click the Drive and choose Format
<br />
<br />Choose any file system and click Start
<br />
<br />If you want a more secure wipe, uncheck 'Quick Format'

<p>then talk to the staff of MW3 and they may be able to help you as they have control to the servers etc.</p>
<p>also file a complaint him and if he still stalks you why not play a different game for a while .</p>

<p>Please don't name other gamertags names on threads as its breaking the rule known as "name of shame"</p>

<p>Along with filing a complaint and avoiding the player I would also suggesting appearing offline and seeing if he still gets matched with you. If that player gets matched with you then he is just luckily getting put in a lobby with you most likely based on
 connection. If he stops appearing in your matches then he was joining you by your gamertag on his recent played list. There are some crazy people out there that just like messing with people. Appearing offline can really help if someone is following you across
 games. &nbsp;And if you're not sure how to appear offline you hit the Guide button go over right twice to the Settings blade and select Preferences then Online Status and select Appear offline.</p>

<p>I myself have had this issue , the way he will be finding you is through his recent players.. so you need to play enough people till he drops of your recen players list, either when he is offline , or by you playing offline or on a game he doesnt own.
</p>
<p>The other way he can follow /find you is if he has had a message from you, unfortunately they stay for about 3 weeks. .so definately block and report hun.. Good luck. I managed to lose mine.</p>

<p>If you want to get away from any Xbox stalker, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.Press the silver guide button.</p>
<p>2.Go to friends. Look at the tab all the way to the right, labeled "players". (This is a list of people you have recently played with online.)</p>
<p>3. Access their profile by tapping the "A" button on their gamertag. </p>
<p>4. Access player review, then avoid the player.</p>
<p>5. Follow steps 1-3, but this time, access the File Complaint tab. </p>
<p>6.Follow the on screen descriptions to file a complaint on what he/she is violating. If enough people do this, XBLE will handle the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My taskbar is having the same issues as described above. I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 in August. My laptop is an Acer Aspire E5-571-52GR. Since I upgraded the start menu and cortana both haven't left-clickable after about an hour after each time I turn
 on. However, now the problem is more severe and the time does not appear and programs do not appear in the taskbar either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you resolve this issue? I cannot believe so many people have had this same problem and there is no clear fix. I am approximately 2 days away from buying a Mac and never touching Windows again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed your above advice and all the advice on the following pages but with no success:</p>

    <title>Microphone not working since upgrade to 1803 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeycrockett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone not working since upgrade to 1803</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the upgrade to 1803 this morning. After it was done, I noticed that the microphone connected to my audio interface stopped working. It wasn't a driver issue, since monitoring the input in the
 audio settings dialogue (mmsys.cpl) worked fine. I did a little research and found a website reporting on this. Apparently, turning on access for Apps in the privacy settings brings it back.</p>
<p>This seems to be a bug, as - according to the description - neither of the two options in the privacy settings should change anything for regular programs (executables, not that UWP nonsense), however,
 the first one is phrased a bit contradictory as it fails to make a distinction between programs and market apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Errors in various applications with first option enabled and second option disabled:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mmsys.cpl -&gt; No error, but no input level. peaks only shown when monitoring.</p>
<p>VoiceMeeter -&gt; No error, but no input level.</p>
<p>Audacity -&gt; Error while opening sound device.</p>
<p>Adobe Audition -&gt; Internal Error.</p>
<p>FL Studio ASIO-&gt; No Error, but no input level.</p>
<p>ASIO4ALL -&gt; Red X.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tested hosts: MME, WDM, DirectSound, WASAPI, ASIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning on access for Market Apps brings the mic back to a working state, but that is not a solution. I do not want the subsystem listening to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">anything</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please open a ticket and fix.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Xbox one Instant-On mode safe to turn off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one Instant-On mode safe to turn off&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering if anyone knew whether or not it is safe to turn off the xbox one console at the wall, whilst it is in instant on mode. As the it can be installing updates in this mode I think it is probably not safe, but I am not really sure.

<p>Wouldn't recommend it but mines been turned off at the wall a few times (when bf wouldn't load) and i also had my electric cut out a couple of times but the box seems fine so i dunno for definite but at the moment it doesn't seem to be a problem with it
 though i wouldn't go switching it on and off at the wall a-lot if i was i'd keep it in full power down mode.</p>

<p>Yeah the instant on mode is pretty useful, but at night I usually turn it off at the wall so was wondering whether it was safe to do so.</p>

<p>There isnt anything anywhere that suggests with the instant on power mode it is unadvisable to switch off the plug socket,ive been turning mine off completely with both power options every night since launch and have no problems,but again up to you,personally
 I think in general having it set to energy saver is better in the longrun,on instant you build up a backlog of everything you do bit by bit and it slows evetything down,a friend and I were testing this out this morning,and on both xb1s,back on energy saver
 and after a correct hard reboot...</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Which is hold the xb1 power button for 5 seconds,tv goes black,remove finger,DO NOT UNPLUG IT AS SO MANY HAVE BEEN MISINFORMING PEOPLE,and let it restart,you will see a green screen,then black with the xb1 symbol,then dash..</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Both out xb1s are running like they were on launch.and navigation round the ui is loads faster,I can live without 'xbox on' &nbsp;for now.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I dont know how many people activly use windows 8 for their phones,laptops,home pcs,but if you do you will know already 'instant on' isnt a good thing for your RAM in general and the xb1 lay out of apps and storage it uses off the RAM really is no different
 than a windows 8 phone to be blunt.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>But its the same old chestnut,we wouldnt be even having this conversation if MS were allowed to do the 1st original plan for the xb1.</p>
