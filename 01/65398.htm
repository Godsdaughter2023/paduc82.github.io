<h2>            How to reinstall windows 8 using the product key embedded in my asus laptop&#39;s BIOS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop came with <strong>windows 8</strong> pre installed , which I later upgraded to
<strong>windows 8.1</strong> . Then I used a utility to extract my windows product key for future use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now when I use the product key for a fresh install of windows 8/8.1 it says my product key is not valid. Technically, windows shouldn't even ask for a product key as it is embedded in my BIOS !
</p>
<p>I am now at my wit's end and was hoping if anyone could guide me on how to perform a clean install of windows 8...</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - I used windows installation media tool to create a bootable usb for resetting my pc and fresh install of windows 8.1 . After the reset was completed, it says that my windows is not activated . When I use my product key i get the message
 - <em>that key can't be used to activate this edition of windows. Please use a different key</em>.</p>

    <title>Adobe Flash Player doesnt show as installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adobe Flash Player doesnt show as installed</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with Windows 8 and Adobe Flash Player.&nbsp; The day Windows 8 was installed, I&nbsp;had the most current version of Flash Player on my hard drive&nbsp;- the next day, I didn't have any version installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't uninstall, what happened?&nbsp; So, when
 I try to install, full version or&nbsp;just an update, I am brought to this help page -
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-issues-windows-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-issues-windows-8.html</a> - I've followed all of the instructions, and I still cannot install or use Adobe Flash Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how I try to install a new version, or even ANY version, I'm brought to this help screen.&nbsp; To confuse things further, I understand that Adobe Flash is now embedded into IE10 and Windows 8, but I show NO version of Adobe Flash on my hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed a Windows 8 update, hoping it would resolve the issue, but no such luck.&nbsp; What can I do to resolve?</p>

            <p>There is NO support for Windows 8 right now.&nbsp; I tried everything, and finally one thing worked.&nbsp; For those of you that still have this issue, check your ActiveX settings, make sure it is de-selected.&nbsp; I thought mine was, and as it turns out, that was my
 problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From IE tool bar, click on "Tools".&nbsp; The 4th line down in that menu is "ActiveX Filtering", make sure there is NO check mark in the left column, next to ActiveX Filtering.&nbsp; If you see a check mark, uncheck it.&nbsp; If your is system is like mine, you need to
 check that every so often, to make sure it is still unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for those of you, who use Yahoo Email (I also had this issue), to be able to view your email, without having to revert back to "Classic Email", make sure you view in the "Compatibility View" - you can do this simply by clicking on the icon up by the
 "refresh" symbol, up in the address bar.&nbsp; It's the symbol that looks like a torn piece of paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

It's a silly situation: If you're using the fullscreen Metro IE10, Flash operates on a whitelist. If you're using desktop IE10, Flash is unrestricted.<br />

            <p>You mean if you are using&nbsp;Metro IE 10 Microsoft and/or Adobe is controlling what&nbsp;we can or cannot view? I didn't know that our freedoms had been done away with ? This is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated. &nbsp;Where is the Justice Department when
 we need them? Microsoft should be broken-up!&nbsp; George Washington would roll-over in his grave! "Give me Liberty or Give me Death!" Where do I purchase or download Linux?&nbsp; We should all immediately Start and Boycott ALL Microsoft Software and/or products completely&nbsp;.
 Start by returning&nbsp;all copies of Windows 8 and demanding a refund. </p>

            If you are annoyed by this, but like the immersive browser, look into getting the next OS.&nbsp; I read on these forums on a post by an MS worker&nbsp;that the Windows 8 UI apps are just a preview of what they are working on for the next OS.&nbsp; I suppose they are
 seeing if people like it before they spend the time and money programming the full app.&nbsp; This is just second hand information, but with the flexibility of the desktop, I can easily believe it.

<h2>            50&#37; of memory in use when computer is idle</h2>
                    Hi
<div>I am running Vista Home Premium SP2 on my Toshiba laptop with 2.0GB RAM</div>
<div>For the last few months the laptop has become progressively slower, especially when accessing the internet via Google Chrome. When I run task manager, the physical memory usage is over 50% with no applications running. There are lots of processes and services
 running but I don't know enough about this to know which ones might be causing me a problem, which ones I need and which I don't. I suspect that something is conflicting with something else but again I don't know enough to be able to identify what to do next.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I type this, with no other applications running, I have 70 processes running (all users), my CPU usage is 16% and my physical memory use is 61%.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help would be most welcome</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Windows Update Stage 3 of 3 0&#37; is Frozen.. Unable to load into desktop</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is a Sony Vaio Laptop with Windows Vista Home Edition</p>
<p>At this time I do not have the restore disc that came with my Sony Vaio and want to try all options that result in RECOVERING all my files and data from my computer. It is important that I get my files back and if i&nbsp;do i will be sure to back them up.</p>
<p>The Problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>On around June 28th 2010 Windows had started an automatic update while the computer was left on overnight. In the morning when I returned to my computer, it was on a continuous loop of trying to load an automatic update saying "Configuring Updates Stage
 3 of 3 - 0%"... do not turn off computer and after it fails to load it begins to restart my computer and it does this over and over again. If I end the cycle by taking away the power source and then turning it back on manually, I have the option to start my
 computer with safe mode or normally. I have tried all 3 safe modes and they all have the same result which is the continuous loop of trying to complete stage 3 of 3 in the update. I have pressed F8 and tried to start with the "last good known configuration"
 but that also has the same result. I also was able to go to a vaio menu through F8 which gave me the option to perform a system restore. When I restored to an earlier date, the only change that happened was when the computer booted and started the update (like
 before).. it first would say "Stage 1 of 3 0%," then it would jump to "Stage 3 of 3 0%" like before and after a minute would restart and continue the loop.&nbsp; I am unable to get to the login user point because the update starts before.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything else I can do. If there is nothing else, then please let me know what I should do once I am able to get my Sony recovery disc (I wont be able to get it for a few months). I really need to recover my files.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can use the solutions&nbsp;in this KB&nbsp;- 4 methods and I listed a little help for them below<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Start Windows Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;with the Windows installation media, and then<br />
use the Repair feature <br />
<br />
How to Do a Startup Repair in Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91467-startup-repair.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91467-startup-repair.html</span></a><br />
<br />
You can also do a Startup Repair from Safe Mode accessing the Recovery Options if you<br />
have them available or use the DVD as above.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options - Vista<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: Start the system in safe mode, and then use the System Restore feature<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista <br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span></a></p>

<br />
<br />
You can also do a System Restore by booting up with a Vista or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>: Use the Downloads at the end of this article - note versions for Vista x86 32 bit<br />
and Vista x64 64 bit.<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong>:<br />
<br />
At the Command Prompt or Recovery Options or a Vista disk boot<br />
<br />
Type or copy and paste these in one at a time (not the press ENTER)<br />
<br />
c:windows\winsxs\ in the commandprompt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
press ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR pending.*<br />
press ENTER&nbsp; and you should see the pending.xml<br />
<br />
ren pending.xml pending.old<br />
press ENTER.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is the older complete Method 4<br />
<br />
Use the System Recovery options or Vista Boot Disk to rename the Pending.xml file and<br />
edit the registry:</p>
<p>On the System Recovery Options page, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Type cd C:\windows\winsxs, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type ren pending.xml pending.old, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type regedit, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.</p>
<p>On the File menu, click Load Hive.</p>
<p>Locate the following folder:</p>
<p>C:\windows\system32\config\components</p>
<p>When you are prompted for a name, type Offline_Components.</p>
<p>In Registry Editor, locate and then delete the following registry<br />
subkey:</p>
<p>HLKM\Offline Components\AdvancedInstallersNeedResolving</p>
<p>HKLM\Offline Components\PendingXmlIdentifier</p>
<p>Exit Registry Editor:</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type exit to exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Press ENTER.</p>
<p>Restart System<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once you are in Windows again I would run the Reset here as a precaution.<br />

<p>If you can't get into Windows you need a Vista disk - if you do not have one you can<br />
borrow a friends as the are not copy protected and the system maker will usually sell<br />
you the physical disk cheap (you are only paying for the DVD as you already own Vista).<br />
Or you can make a Repair Disk.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>

<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.</span></p>

 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 restore points disappeared and my desktop icons disappeared</h2>
                    I have a new HP desktop running Windows 7.&nbsp; I booted up this morning and my desktop icons disappeared.&nbsp; I can see the desktop and all the icons in windows explorer, but for some reason they will not appear on my desktop.&nbsp; I tried to use a system restore
 to roll the PC back to yesterdays checkpoint BUT when I brought up system restore, it said NO restore point had ever been created.&nbsp; Not so...created one yesterday and the day before when I loaded new software.&nbsp; Any ides what is going on; what would cause the
 desktop and icons to not appear on the screen and why would my restore points go away? My traybar and windows gadgets all appear just fine.&nbsp; I will put the desktop through a scan disk to check for disk errors; I read on one of the forums to try that when one
 has a problem with the restore points disappearing.&nbsp; Thanks for any ideas on how to resolve these two Windows 7 problems.

            I fixed the problem with the desktop icons not showing, some how the "display desktop icons" tab got unselected, no idea how since I did not do it and I am the only one who uses this system.&nbsp; I reselected that feature and now all my desktop icons appear.&nbsp;
 Still no idea why my two system restore points disappeared. If anyone experiences this issue with disappearing restore points in Windows 7 and finds a solution, I would appreciate your insight on this item.<br />

<h3> sligo123  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Windows cannot configure this wireless connection&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>I have (birthday gift) a Dell Inspiron 1011 laptop with Windows XP Home. &nbsp;It has a 'Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini Card'. &nbsp;It works wirelessly at home but when away and trying to use WiFi access points, if I search for available networks it comes up with 'Windows
 cannot configure this wireless connection'. &nbsp;(It also comes up with this message at home if I search for network, but works OK on whatever is I have on home set up). &nbsp;I have searched on-line and found a 'fix' from Microsoft, but when I tried to use it a warning
 came up that 'this type of file could damage my computer' so I aborted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another area I looked at explained that software other than Windows was controlling WiFi and it was not advisable to disable it. &nbsp;(Presumably this was Dell software?)</p>
<p>I am very non PC literate and would appreciate any very simple help!!</p>

<p>Hi sligo123</p>
<p>You may find that link a bit confusing.&nbsp; I suggest you enable the WZC service (this is the service Windows uses to control the wireless, as opposed to the Dell software).&nbsp; Heres how:</p>
<p>1. Go to Start, then Run</p>
<p>2. In the box, type C:/Windows\system32\services.msc /s</p>
<p>3. Click OK</p>
<p>4. In the resulting window, you should have a big list of services, scroll down until you find Windows Zero Configuration - double click on it</p>
<p>5. In the box, make sure that in the drop-down box, Automatic is selected.&nbsp; Then click the button that says Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try that and then try to connect to the wireless network (you may have to reconnect to your home network)</p>
<p>If that doesnt help, please post back here and we can try something else.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>Have a Micro Advantage dual 16X 8 DVD/CD RW that is not reconized by XP Professional.&nbsp; Aslo have a CD unit and when windows installs the drivers - it gives them both the same driver.&nbsp; The DVD RW is only reconized as a CD !!&nbsp;Have used Microsoft fixit and
 it says everything is fine. - It is using the same driver for both the DVD RW and the CD Units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also have a ATi Radeon 9550 AGP 250M for Video and VGA and XP Windows does not reconize - have question Marks for them in Device manager.&nbsp; Microsoft fixit - did fix this problem.</p>
<p>Have removed the drivers and tried to have Microsoft check the computer for downloads and it does not find them - if I do a check for hardware changes it only finds ones that are not working properly and that are not working at all, as mentioned above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have also gone to Microsoft Web site and can not find a solution there - Have clicked on so many links with no help that I could see.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>To work around this problem in Microsoft Windows XP, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem
 occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the modified registry entries. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the right pane, click UpperFilters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the right pane, click LowerFilters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Exit Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span><span>j.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you notice a loss of functionality in a particular program such as in CD recording software after you remove the UpperFilters and LowerFilters registry values, reinstall that software. If this problem occurs again, contact the software vendor
 for help.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove the existing drivers. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If Control Panel is in Category View, click Performance and Maintenance, and then click System.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After your computer restarts; the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></p>

<h2>            Nuvi satnav seen in Explorer and Device Manager, but not Disk Management</h2>
                    The satnav has internal storage and an 8 Gb SD card. Garmin Express doesn't seem to see the SD card. Both the Nuvi and SD card are seen in Explorer and the drive is seen in Device Manager, but does not appear in Disk Management. For the Garmin problem,
 one remedy seems to be to format the SD card, but how can I do this if the unit isn't seen in Disk Management? (and why isn't it seen?)

            It's supposed to be FAT32, according to Garmin posts with similar problems. It's not encrypted. My first question is how it can appear perfectly well in both Device Manager and Explorer, but not in Disk Management (I shouldn't need to have to faff around
 with third party software). So my first aim is to get it seen by Disk Management in Win 10

            <p>Hi Captain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link is only for the SD card.</p>
<p>The problem is not just the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SD card</span> - it's the wh<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ole Nuvi internal storage plus SD car</span>d - neither are seen in Disk Management, but both are seen in Explorer and
 both can be accessed to see the folders and files.</p>
<p>It happens on all USB sockets on the computer and on two computers</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the part of the link that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"1) Insert the memory card. Does a drive letter appear for it in My Computer? What letter?<br />
<br />
2) Next start Disk Management. Click Start-&gt;Run, enter <strong>services.exe</strong> . Scroll down to
<strong>Logical Disk Manager</strong> and <strong>Logical Disk Manager Administrator.
</strong>Do both of these services show their Status=<strong>Started</strong>?<br />
<br />
3) Finally, click Start-&gt;Run, enter <strong>msinfo32</strong>. Click Components-&gt;Storage<br />
&gt; Click <strong>Drives</strong> in left pane. Copy/paste the content displayed in right pane to your next post<br />
&gt; Click <strong>Disks</strong> in left pane. Copy/paste the content displayed in right pane to your next post "
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no drive letter for the Nuvi in Explorer, only an icon</p>
<p>Neither of those services appear, though they were for XP in the link, not Win 10</p>
<p>Msinfo32 doesn't list the drive or disk for the satnav</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Added 6/8/16</p>
<p>Removing the SD card, I get the same effects for the Nuvi alone.</p>
<p>In Device Manager under Events, I have:</p>
<p>Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service WinUsb for Device Instance ID USB\VID_091E&amp;PID_479B\0000E94BDBB3 with the following status: 0.</p>
<p>Device USB\VID_091E&amp;PID_479B\0000e94bdbb3 requires further installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Explorer/Properties, the File system is given as Generic Hierarchical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? Obviously, Garmin Support are no more use than a chocolate teapot. Had the same problem with my previous Nuvi&nbsp; - never resolved!</p>

            <p>Yes, it's a Nuvi problem. Apparently there are two mass storage formats and the Nuvi should connect automatically to the right one. But it doesn't. To get it to connect, you have to go to the Diagnostics page, which you are not even told exists
<br />
</p>
<p>"To make sure the device is connected correctly:</p>
<p>Some of Garmin's newer devices are now Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) devices which do not automatically go into Mass Storage mode when connected to a computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Power the unit and go to the main screen. </li><li>Press Volume. </li><li>Press and hold the top right corner of the screen for ten seconds. </li><li>A Diagnostics&nbsp;page will appear. </li><li>Press Configuration Settings ( some devices may need to skip this step) </li><li>Scroll down and choose MTP Setting </li><li>Select Mass Storage Single Session </li></ol>
<p>The device will now go into mass storage mode when connected. After the initial connection, it will go back to MTP mode when connected again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only answer of any use I've ever received from Garmin Support about anything!</p>

            <p>Yes, it works in Win 10 and the device and SD card are seen. The trouble is you have to do it each time! So much for Auto detect!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to try and solve the real problem - why the Nuvi (and the previous Nuvi) seem not to see the SD card, though this is probably a messed up software message from Garmin Express - I believe it might say "the internal device is almost full, buy an SD card"
 till it actually needs to use the SD card, then stops **** about it. According to a post on the Internet, this is exactly what happens! Garmin Support says it isn't, but Garmin Support are totally useless.</p>

<p>First off , you are right about the Garmin support which is totally unefficiÃ«nt (probably in every country).</p>
<p>It is wasting your time to ask questions for which each time we get a stupid answer.</p>
<p>No effort is ever made trying further actions by the front line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You received however an answer , being one exception confirming a general rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirm that it is a NÃ¼vi problem. For my NÃ¼vi I have the same issue (no drive letter).</p>
<p>I will try that MTP setting to Mass Storage solution ; but it is not really a good solution for one has to repeat the procedure each time over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That problem <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does not occur with my GPSmap62s</span>, where I can see separate driveletters for the unit and for ÂµSD card.</p>
<p>Both get always a fixed driveletter (using USBDLM to assign a fixed letter to each usb connected device)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I <strong>"remove safely" the GPSmap62s in Win10,</strong> <strong>
the whole PC freezes for whatever reason !</strong></p>
<p>Only when removing the usb cable, Windows 10 comes back alive. Anyone having same issue ?</p>
<p>It is somehow related to the mass storage usb protocol in this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NÃ¼vi however does not even appear in the "remove safely" list !!</p>

    <title>windows 8 will not boot following shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peharrison  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 will not boot following shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 yesterday (downloaded and installed 32 bit).&nbsp; I have a simple active partition so no dual boot etc.&nbsp; If I shut down Windows 8 it will not reboot but rather after initial BIOS load and asking if I want to boot from CD/DVD it just hangs....nothing
 on screen and no disk activity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can recover by booting from the Windows 8 DVD (I burned from ISO), selecting Repair, Advanced, Automatically fix boot problems.&nbsp; Interesting it reports it has failed to fix!? but actually the system will then restart after a shutdown, but thereafter if
 I shutdown again I revert to the same problem.&nbsp; Interestingly it's okay f I restart the PC as opposed to completely shutting down.&nbsp; (Problem is if we have a power interruption then we're back into the problem again).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I have appended the SRT log file below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated as otherwise everything else seems okay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

            Hi Lisette.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Turn off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers using the Dell Service tag stickered on your PC:<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Products/laptop?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Produ...</a>  
<br />Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Window 10 to 7 rollback failed</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have tried to roll back Windows 10 to my orgional Windows 7 as a number of my programmes weren't working properly in 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rollback appeared to be going through okay but then produced a message to say that it has failed and on restart keeps going through the same loop to failure message. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. I would&nbsp;like to assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that Windows was unable to rollback to the previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding, I would like to know if you are able to locate the Windows folder for the previous Operating System, which is&nbsp;critical when considering Rollback.&nbsp;The &nbsp;Path would be-
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></p>
<p>Employ the System File Checker tool and see if it helps to resolve any issue with system file integrity.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the note Sayan and your help so far,</p>
<p>I can't find the c:\windows.old file that you refer to but have only browsed the file manager that I can access...nothing deeper in the machine. I ran the method 1 fix you suggested and that came back to say no problems found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been presented with a Systems Preperation Tool3.14 box to cleanup and prepare the system of OOBE (out of box experience?) and that has run. The process updates looked to be unloading everything that was needed to return the laptop to it's as new settings
 e.g. it was intalling microsoft home office, adobe etc. but the process fails at what appears to be the very last stage with a message that there was a fatal error and windows couldnt be installed. On restart I then get what looks like a basic windows 7 OS
 but none of the orgional software that was on the machine (home office etc)</p>
<p>Any further suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rob</p>

            <p>I guess my machine is too far gone. Windows 10 upgrade ran 10x slower than Windows 7 on my Lenovo W510 Thinkpad. Started the rollback but it got stuck in a loop where it just kept rebooting. I have a backup, I have a rescue disk, they just don't seem to
 "work".&nbsp; Made another rescue disk on another Windows 7 machine and it doesn't revive it either. I get a "System Recovery Options" screen but none of the choices fix anything.&nbsp; There is no C:\windows.old</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find a way to the Command Prompt but nothing much works. All of the DISM options are said to be "unknown".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just really want my laptop to run again. I have my Windows key but would be willing to buy another one if it would revive my system.</p>

            No, you will not find it anywhere because Microsoft do not do drivers for sound cards. Locate the make and model of your computer or motherboard, look to see what make and model sound card is on it,&nbsp;and then go to the appropriate manufacturer website to
 get the drivers..

<p>I am experiencing a situation where at any time a screen is available with a search option on it the system starts inserting perpetual 1's i.e. "111111111111111111111111111111111" and just does not stop. start screen - it goes directly to the search charm
 and perpetually inserts 1's. Same with IE or Explorer etc....</p>
<p>I am only using Windows firewall and anti-virus and it has only affected 1 computer, not my laptop or Surface.</p>
<p>Is this a virus or has Win 8 lost its bolt?</p>

            <p>This doesn't sound like a virus to me. It sounds more like a keyboard / touchscreen glitch, where it is feeding 1's all the time, and they only show up when you have something open to accept them.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this, except maybe to use device manager to disable input devices one by one until you find the culprit.</p>

    <title>Episode Duscae Download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeromanex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Episode Duscae Download</h2>
                    
<p>Last year I pre-ordered Final Fantasy Type 0 HD Digital Day One Edition. It appears I never got the code for the Duscae demo though. I didn't think anything of it as at the time I didn't have the space to install it, but now I have a 5tb hard drive and with
 the release of the FF15 Platinum Demo I went to download Duscae and realized I can't. I went through Xbox Support, who sent me to Square Enix support, who sent me back to Xbox Support, who sent me here. Basically every step along the way I've been told "It
 says here that you should be able to download it" but I can't. So now I'm here to see what you&nbsp;guys can do. I have the purchase order and transcripts from every chat.</p>

            <p>Hey there Zeromanex.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you haven't received a code. If you had pre-ordered the game digitally you would have had automatic access to Episode Duscae when it was released. If you pre-ordered from a retailer they should have provided you with a code. I'm afraid if you haven't downloaded Episode Duscae by now you would no longer have access to download it.</p>
<p>It isn't quite the same, but the Platinum Demo is available which gives a pretty good feel for the game. Thanks for your understanding, if you have any other Xbox support questions please let us know.</p>

<p>I had thought Duscae used to appear on my downloadable games, but the Xbox Support person said it would be from a code. I just talked to Square Enix Support yesterday, and they told me Episode Duscae is still downloadable. I USED to be able to download it,
 I just didn't have the space. Now Square says it is still downloadable, but told me to talk to Xbox Support. Xbox Support said it was a code and to come here. So are you saying it isn't a code and I have to go back to support?</p>

            <p>Hey Zeromanex,</p>
<p>Duscae was not sent out via codes, unfortunately it looks like there was a miscommunication there. If you are unable to locate the demo in your 'Ready to install' list, unfortunately you will not be able to access Duscae as it is no longer up for download in the Xbox Store.</p>

<h2>            Aspect ratio problem</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba netbook with Windows 7 Starter. The pictures on websites, etc. are distorted. When I try to change the aspect ratio (by right clicking on the desktop) to "maintain aspect ratio", it will not let me apply the change. I can select "center
 screen" which maintains the proportion, but then I lose a percent on each side of the screen. Is there any fix for this? Thanks.

            Hi Earlhamite,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is the issue limited to Internet Explorer?<br />
When are you facing this issue? Is it while playing a video file, using a picture as a wallpaper?<br />
Does the desktop show the entire screen?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
I would recommend you to use the correct resolution according to the resolution of the monitor that you have.<br />
Follow the articles bwlor for additional help:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution</span></a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-the-best-display-on-your-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-the-best-display-on-your-monitor</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
<strong>You can try uninstalling and reinstalling&nbsp; the Display adapter drivers:</strong><br />
Uninstall and reinstall the Graphics adapter drivers:<br />
1. Go to Start and right-click on Computers and select Manage. This will bring the Computer Management window, now on the left sidebar select Device Manager.<br />
2. Then go to Display Adapters and right click on it's name and click on uninstall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To reinstall the drivers right click on your cardâs name and finally click Update Driver Software<br />
3. You have two options here, click the option that reads "search automatically for updated driver software".<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player with WinTV-PVR-150</h2>
                    Hello. Did a clean install with Windows 7 from XP. Media player worked great on XP. After upgrading to W7 and doing all the tuner driver updates Medai center is stuck on channel 27 and Media player will not allow me to change the channel. I need channel
 3 to work with my digital over the air converter.
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div>I've done all the W7 updates and have installed the tuner drivers several times.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Is Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Wifi driver incompatable with windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a ton of forums on the wifi problems Yoga 2 pros have since installing Windows 10, but I am still confused and trying to fix the issue. After trouble shooting I keep getting the error that "one or more protocols are missing on this computer". I
 have tried installing the protocols, but it doesn't let me. I have tried every fix I can find through the command prompt, and reinstalling/updating drivers. Is there an offical fix for this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>After downloading the latest version of Skype just now I called and spoke with a Pediatrician friend in Crimea, which peninsula has had many connection problems since the Russian Federation decided it was theirs. The connection was excellent. She was in
 her rose garden so we just spoke. Next time if she is inside we will try Live video. The only suggestion that comes to mind is to turn on Russian and Ukrainian as language options on your keyboard. Not sure that makes any difference. My conversation was in
 English almost entirely. </p>

    <title>Scanning a hard drive as an external drive vs scanning it as the boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgmw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scanning a hard drive as an external drive vs scanning it as the boot drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a client who has two computers infected by malware. After running MSE &amp; MBAM on the drives, the PC's&nbsp;came up clean, but the malware reared its ugly head w/in a day or so. Obviously, the drives weren't cleaned and most readers of this question know
 that there's more that can be done. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can pull the hard drives from the machines, hook them up to my PC and scan with my AV software (Sophos). Sophos has found malware on each of the drives and said it has removed the files. All fine and good. If Sophos is 100% correct and found the infected
 files and removed them, is the drive really clean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering what role the registry plays in malware. A co-worker of mine felt that the role of the registry in malware&nbsp;was a system of pointers to files that were the problem. (There are also many hidden, sytem files, including Restore Points and SysVol
 not to mention root kits on the drive.) Once those files were removed, the malware was no longer a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking there's too much of an interplay between the registry and files on the hard drive. Without a drive being a boot drive, is there an effective way of exorcising the malware? (Root kits, of course, being another matter.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any thoughts.</p>

            <p>Hi Rgmw,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee if Sophos has 100% correct and found the infected files and removed them. To make sure you may again run the security software and check.
</p>
<p>You may also scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found when scanning tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, scan the drive for exorcising the malware from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this information helps.</p>
