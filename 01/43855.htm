<p>To make that account an Xbox Live account, just log into his profile on the xbox, hit the guide button on the controller and choose the Join Xbox Live option. This will keep his achievements and promote him to an Live account. Then you will be walked through
 the process of joining xbox live and you should get the one month free option as you haven't used them all up. You only get the one month trial for the first three Xbox Live profiles that you create on the console.</p>

            <p>Nope, iCloud doesn't allow this.&nbsp; Apple pretty much thinks if you want to use Apple, you have to use

<p>
</p><p>You can do it using Outlook (see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-ecoms/how-to-sync-icloud-contacts-with-people-app/512ab143-a3cf-4775-879b-9cf35975adea">

<h2>            Can people on my network, but not homegroup, see files on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently using my home network which is in a guest house. We have opened the network up so that guests may use the network to access the internet.</p>
<p>What I would like to know is, if a user connects to the same network as me, but does not know the password for the homegroup, can they see my files? And can XP users and non-W7 users see the files when connected to the network if I am in a homegroup?</p>
<p>I want my computer to be&nbsp;visible&nbsp;for the use of my PS3, Xbox and phone... but I do not want guests having access to it! How can I stop this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
If you have on the Network computers that run other Windows versions (Not Win 7), you have to configure the Network as Work Network.<br />
Configuring the Permission/Security gives you all the flexibility needed for the Sharing scheme.<br />
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup </strong>= Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Home Network or Work Network</strong> = Basically similar(and better) to the previous methods of<strong> Work Group</strong> sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a with the same<strong>Work Group</strong> name while each computer has its own<strong>unique name.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall, AV, or other components of Security allow free local traffic on all Networked computers. If you use 3rd party Security On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network
 IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><strong><br />
Please Note that some <em>3rd party Software Firewalls/AV/Security suits</em> keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of
 local network traffic.</p>
<p>If end up with the 3rd party software uninstalled or disabled, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/sharing-files-with-homegroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/sharing-files-with-homegroup</a></p>
<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network (</strong><strong>works very well if all computers are Win 7 too).</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<br />
<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues with Vista/Win7, check the <strong>
following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>
<p>This screen shot is from Win 7, Vista's menus are similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . All users that are allowed to share need to have account on<strong>all the computers</strong> that they are allowed to connect to.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone</strong> is an account, it means a group of all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It is available to avoid the need of configuring permission to each on its own, it does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong>
 that feel that they would like to login.</p>

                    Hi can someone please help me. Can I just say if someone can help me could you please explain it in a way that a 5 yr old would understand as I'm no good with computers :( My 11 yr old son has a laptop a toshiba windows 8 (I think) anyway he put a password
 on it and forgot it, for weeks we both tried to get in and couldn't. I took it to a local shop and asked the man if he would be able to help and reset without deleting anything as I have so many precious photos on there. He said he could "great" but when I
 got it home I still couldn't sign in to my sons user profile because password is unknown. There was a administrator profile which I could get in without a password. But I was unable to view pictures or connect online. I called the man back to ask what was
 going on, all he could explain to me was that my sins password was done online?? And he was unable to reset password so only thing he could do was admin user but it won't allow me to do anything. That was as much help he could give

<p>Hi hlshah,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:</p>

<p>To remove the "Location" history from "Desktop Background" list, then&nbsp; follow these steps:</p>
<p>1) Open <strong>regedit </strong>and goto:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Explorer\Wallpapers\Images</strong></p>
<p>2) In right-side pane, you'll see all the directory paths. Simply delete the desired key associated with the path which you want to remove.</p>
<p>3) Thats it. Now you can check the Desktop Background list and your deleted path will not be present there.</p>

<p>Hi Dasha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums for assistance, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to best troubleshoot this issue, we would like some more information since not being able to sign in to Fortnite could be the result of a network issue among other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Fortnite the only game having issues? Besides the error code what other message displays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you go into your Network settings and select the Test multiplayer connection test?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's all good, then go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer those questions for us and try the power cycle and then let us know if that helps.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, then turn off Cortana and then try to turn it on and check if it works.<br />

    <title>Surface 3 cannot connect to second monitor, &#34;display settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> campbell92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 cannot connect to second monitor, &#34;display settings cannot be saved&#34; Resolution is grayed out</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purchased Windows mini display port to VGA adapter, connect monitor to surface, monitor does not display</p>
<p>Ctrl + P choose "Duplicate", monitor does not display</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; display &gt; Advanced settings. Under Multiple displays: choose "show on only 2" (or extend or duplicate) Resolution is grayed out. Apply " The display settings could not be saved. Please try a different combination of display settings". It recognizes
 that the monitor is there (advanced display settings show the options for extend, duplicate and show only on 2 when I connect the monitor) but the screen will not show up on the monitor. Tried another brand of external monitor as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent over 8 hours researching, Looks like it's a driver issue with "Intel(R) HD Graphics" under "Display adapters" in device manager. I tried downloading drivers for it (have not been able to find with certainty the correct driver for Windows 10
 64-bit - there are a bunch on the Intel site and you can't really search by device and OS and device you are looking for drivers for), then have to extract the file and find the .inf file from the .exe because to update driver from device mgr you need .inf
 not the .exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Inter(r) Graphics Properties shows "Device PCI \VEN_8086&amp;DEV_22Bo&amp;SUBSYS_0009141&amp;REV_20\3&amp;11583659&amp;0&amp;10 requires further installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I get a message that the folder doesn't contain the correct file for this device. I'm hesitant to uninstall the device because then I may lose the monitor and since I can't get it to connect to a second monitor that would be game over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was even considering buying W8.1 (been too long since the W10 upgrade for me to roll back to W8.1) but the thought of having to reinstall office (don't know where my product key is) and everything else I've done to customize my tablet is daunting. Anbdb
 so unnecessary. There should be better support for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a simple issue and what should be a simple plug and play functionality of connecting a monitor. I have seen a lot of "I have the same issue". Please help solve this - kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help.</p>
<p>

            At this point, if you are in the US, the best solution is to take the tablet and adapter to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and let them test there. I know you are frustrated, but we've ruled out the video driver at this point.

<h3> chief firebird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Character Names vs Gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>I played the PC beta, and when I ran into other players, I would see their character name above their head instead of their ESO login/username. It really added to the experience. I hope we will get the same feature on the Xbox One, instead of being forced
 to see gamertags instead?</p>

<p>I would hope that the option is with the player. I don't want my gamer tag or even my ESO ID broadcast that widely without my permission. In a game that large I want to hide behind more than one wall; it's just asking for trouble to have anything associated
 with a password hanging out in the open for all to see.</p>

            There is only one 100% way to delete everything on a hard drive so that it is impossible to recover any of it and that is to take it out of the computer and destroy the hard drive.&nbsp; So it depends on how sensitive the information on the hard drive is.&nbsp;
 You can wipe the hard drive.&nbsp; Several runs would prevent most people without specialist equipment from recovering any information. There are a number of tools on the internet specifically designed to wipe hard drives.&nbsp; A free one can be found on
<a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a>&nbsp;Go to tools&gt;drive wiper&gt;Choose entire drive. Run this a few times and that should be good enough for most purposes.

            As others have already told you, there are ways of clearing the hard drive.&nbsp; It erases everything, and I mean everything.&nbsp; The problem is that the party you are donating to, would find it a useless PC unless they have a legal Windows 7 activation code
 and a Win7 disk and the know-how to load and install Win7.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is quite a dilemma because to be perfectly secure, you will be erasing what they need&nbsp; (Windows 7 itself), to make it useful.&nbsp; I suggest you discuss this with the party you plan to donate to.

<p>So today i deleted the beta &nbsp;i had it on my other account)</p>
<p>Why? Because this nickle and diming gets really frustrating. I mean , you have to pay for every shell you shoot, everytime tank is destroyed you have to pay for repairs. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>( my tanks got destroyed like 70 % of time) . you gotta pay for new tanks, for updrades, for camos for symbols.. i know its F2P - but this takes all the fun out of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only they dropped the repair and basic shells buying- id play it every day. But all together- not worth it..</p>

<p>Strategy, yes. It's not an MMO, though. I'm surprised they allowed nicely sized battles online, as opposed to other major retail games that tend to have less. Still pretty fun, even with the bugs that are being ironed out. I like that you get punished if
 you don't work with your team, having little rewards for your repairs and ammo. Of course, the blundering teammates that just run in to die en mass can tend to make the whole match lopsided.</p>

<p>It's a strategy based MMO, not an FPS. These are pretty standard concepts for this type of game.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>LOL. strategy based? MMO ? Its anything BUT strategy... Just like COD - everyone has their own ideaa of how to fight and where to go. Some are runners and some are campers. Saw A LOT of light tanks camp on the back, saw TDs run first ones head in. Strategy
 hardly applies to it....&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the player with biggest credit card will rule..So you can gring all u want, he ll just pay for best consumables, best equipment, best crew and Premium exp and shells, and if he is at least a s good as you - you ll lose.</p>

<p>Curious, how does it give you an advantage? People could have all the money in the world, but if they don't know how to use a tank and keep getting blown up in matches, I highly doubt it would give them advantage at all. You'd be surprised at the number
 of heavies I see just rolling into enemy fire or sitting back behind artillery or mediums and not firing at all.</p>

<p>They can sit back and fire premium shells that have far better penetration, equipped with most expensive equipment , using most expensive consumables to repair and revive the crew. And lets not assume that the players with platinum credit card are dimwits
 and 10 year olds...If we are all of the relatively the same skill- players with money have &nbsp;clear advantage..</p>

<p>That's a big odd, considering the people I always come across when I play. I'm surprised I ever see any artillery kills or light vehicle spots. Much less, I can't remember the last time both teams didn't run a majority of their tanks in a lemming fashion
 right into each other to be killed. I really doubt it'll be much, if any, advantage with the mass that's playing currently. Though, to each their own~</p>

            <p>Hi Lori,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you looking in to the Credential Manager?</p>
<p>2. Are you connected to any network?</p>
<p>3. Are you the lone user of this computer?</p>
<p>4. Is the issue somehow connected to the Family Safety? You have posted the thread in Family Safety category.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Credential Manager allows you to store credentials, such as user names and passwords that you use to log on to websites or other computers on a network. By storing your credentials, Windows can automatically log you on to websites or other computers. Credentials
 are saved in special folders on your computer called <span>vaults</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to first run an online scanner and check if that finds any virus/malware on the computer.</p>

    <title>Xbox wont connect to wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djcritter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox wont connect to wifi</h2>
                    
<p>A few days ago I was playing away online with some mates, 1 mate was having problems hearing me over the headset.</p>
<p>I opted to switch wifi router connection to my mobile broadband router and see if that helped.</p>
<p>My xbox errored on the connection test so to save time I just switched back to my normal router and connection which was working fine before I tryed changing.</p>
<p>I now can't connect to any wifi connection/router.&nbsp; I'm getting a red cross at the first stage between xbox 360 and network with a message test failed these a problem with your connection, select more info for a description of the problem and how to fix
 it.</p>
<p>I have had a look at the more info but its just a script of common problems.&nbsp; I know that the internet is fine and that no settings have changed on my routers. i've tryed three all with the same message.</p>
<p>I've removed the passcode to the connection this did not help, i've shutdown and rebooted the network in order still no change, i've cleared the xbox system cashe.</p>
<p>I'm running a Netgear DG834 with custom firmware a buffallo AP and additional Mobile Broadband Router.</p>

<p>Hi, try this please.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On your console go to settings/ system/ network settings. Select your network connection from the list of available networks. Then select configure network, then additional settings. You will see an option to restore the network settings to the factory defaults,
 do that, power the console off and back on and set up your connection again.</p>

<h2>            DLC in general is a rip-off....&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>very few&nbsp;DLC is worth the price, but the others are not worth the price<br />
^^and yes, I don't have to buy it, and I DON"T!<br />
.<br />
but most people&nbsp;don't care or think DLC is ok, <br />
and so&nbsp;the more people spend on DLC the more&nbsp;the industry has you and&nbsp;the more they will keep scamming&nbsp;you!<br />
.<br />
how about everyone boycott&nbsp;buying DLC!<br />
this will&nbsp;sent the gaming industry a strong message<br />
^^look what you all did with MS's Xbox One Policies, you can do the same with DLC&nbsp;<br />
.<br />
let's not forget:<br />
Season Pass - they want you to think it's a great deal, but it's a an easy way to sucker people in<br />
Online Pass - almost going away, a big No-No!<br />
Left out&nbsp;DLC - the scam of all scams <br />
Locked on&nbsp;Disc&nbsp;DLC - not sure why it's called DLC, when it's already on the disc<br />
F2P+F2W+Microtransactions -&nbsp;nickel and diming at it's finest<br />
.<br />
any developer that discusses DLC before a game is out should be fined $100k and have their studio shut down for a 3 months<br />
any developer caught taking content from a game or locking content on the disc should be fine $500K and studio shut down for a year<br />
any developer making F2P, F2W and have Microtransactions should be put in a cage with an MMA fighter&nbsp;(10 rounds)<br />
.<br />
overall, DLC can be great, but it is misused,&nbsp;abused, a scam, exploitive and legalized extortion....it should be done away with!<br />
^^that said, "Season Pass" should be the standard&nbsp;and cost&nbsp;$8&nbsp;and be valid for as long as the game is supported (no 6 months or a year BS etc...)</p>

<p>DLC is both the best and worst thing to come from this generation.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It started out as a great way to breath life into games and turned into developers stripping down games to the minimum they can for release just so they can charge for "extra content" from day one.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Season passes are the worst of all, as they are basically telling you right from the start how much they could have put into the released game, but didn`t.</p>

<p>DLC was amazing last gen, mostly free and it meant something!</p>
<p>developers took pride in delivering content to those that supported and bought their games</p>
<p>but the it all changed this gen, maybe charging for DLC was a great way to fund the higher game costs and when they seen the amount of money DLC generated, then a light-bulb went off and thus the scam was set in motion</p>
<p>^^at first it was ok, but then got way out of hand and has become what it is today</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>what a shame really!</p>
<p>I suspect it will get worse next gen (XB1, PS4)</p>
<p>^^but we make the industry and we can break, we are no push-overs (I guess easier said then done), the older gaming guys and new gen guys should take action</p>

<p>OP, you really got a bad habit of trying to tell people what to do with their own money. &nbsp;I'll buy what I want.

<p>.</p>
<p>I mean, who is going to fine these studios? &nbsp;Who has the power to shut them down for this "infringement" ?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As you alluded to in your first post -- If you don't agree with the practice, do the most sensible thing, do not buy it.</p>

<p>I'm not per say telling people NOT TO BUY DLC, i am only trying to let it be known that DLC IS A SCAM</p>
<p>you want to buy it, then knock yourself out and have fun</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am not the cause of the rampant DLC scam, it's people as a collective, and those people are ruining it for us that want some of that DLC, but can't due to it's over-priced model</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>and btw, I like to post sensible stuff, we all can be the same and ask the same questions and think alike and want the same things......I like to ask and things that are reasonable and be good for all</p>

<p>@Veroli -- In both of your previous posts in this thread you asked a grand total of 0 questions though. &nbsp;You made statements based off of conjecture. &nbsp;You also failed to address my question of: Who is going to actually fine these studios? and Who has the
 power to shut them down for breaking your rules?</p>

<p>i am only posing a question of what should be done and what I would do to developers if caught doing those things</p>
<p>and whom shall have the power to shut them down?......the people that own the studios (MS, Sony, Other Publishers etc..), and whom will make them do so you ask?....well, that would be us, we speak with our wallets</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>and btw, how are you not in favor of speaking up against those practices of scamming people from hard earned money via over-priced DLC?</p>
<p>^^whether you have money or not, no company should over-price content and rip people off</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would imagine you are for the developers in getting money from used games, right?</p>

<p>DLC is a result of the "keep the disc in the tray" approach that a lot of developers and publishers have to keeping you from trading in your game. Season Passes are a way for them to sort of lock that in - "You're trading in your game? But you haven't even
 got everything you purchased yet!" Good... bad... it's a reality. As to how it's been implemented, that of course varies from title to title.

            <p>​<span>Hi Douglas,</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<span> </span>
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I understand that, you want to fix this WindowsUpdate_80070426, WindowsUpdate_dt000" error.
<span>This problem occurs if the Software Licensing service (Slsvc.exe) is not running while updating windows</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. Don’t worry; we will certainly help you.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </span>
<div><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Which operating system are you using?</span></div>
<div><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Which antivirus application are you using?</span></div>
<div><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>What are the troubleshooting steps you have performed?</span></div>
<div><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>What are the KB numbers of the updates that are failed to install?
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Reply us with above information to help you. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>While you reply us with above information, you may perform these steps.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Method 1: Follow these steps.</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Restart the computer.</span></div>
<div><span>Make sure that Slsvc.exe is running before you start the update. To do this, follow these steps:</span></div>
<div><span>a. Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong> and type <strong><span>Services</span></strong> or<strong><span>services.msc</span></strong> in the search box and then click on<strong><span> Services</span></strong> under Programs section of the search

<div><span>b. If User Account Control asks your permission to continue, click <strong>
<span>Continue</span></strong>. If UAC asks for administrator’s password, enter a valid password.</span></div>
<div><span>c. Scroll down the list to the service <strong><span>Software Licensing</span></strong> and double-click it.</span></div>
<div><span>d. In the properties window of the Software Licensing service, set <strong>
<span>Startup type</span></strong> to <strong><span>Automatic</span></strong>.</span></div>
<div><span>e. Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong> to start the service. If the status is already running, click the<strong><span> Stop</span></strong> button and confirm with<strong><span> Yes</span></strong> to stop the service. Restart the service by
 clicking the<strong><span> Start</span></strong> button.</span></div>
<div><span>f. Click OK to exit from Software Licensing’s Properties window and close the Services window.</span></div>
<div><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></div>

<h2>            Windows 8 Won&#39;t Update</h2>
                    I'm having trouble updating my computer. When i go to use a app like Netflix it'd give me an error code&nbsp;W8156-C00D36BB then would say I need to update my computer. Then I would go to the place to update my computer and it'd say restart to finish installing
 the windows update then when I would restart my computer it wouldn't update while restarting. I tried doing what it says 7 time and even downloaded the troubleshooter to fix the problem, it says it's fixed then I'd try again and it doesn't update.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Armani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
