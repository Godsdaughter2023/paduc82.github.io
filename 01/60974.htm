                    <p>On my Windows 7 desktop I have a locked folder and cannot unlock it. &nbsp; When I tried to delete it I get the message that the file or folder is open and in use by another program. &nbsp; However, I am unable to determine exactly what other program is using it since
 I am not running any other apps.</p>
<p>

<p>Rebooting the machine should unlock the folder.</p>

<p>I bought the&nbsp;Call of Duty: Ghosts Digital Combo but, I still do not have an Xbox One. The box says that I'll be able to download it by going to "My Collections." If I get an Xbox One around November, will I still be able to download the game without any
 extra cost since I already paid an extra 10 bucks for the Xbox One version?</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes. You own both versions if you purchased the combo.</p>
<p>Long answer: Yes, because the code for the digital combo entitles you to both versions of the game. The code you entered adds CoD: Ghosts for Xbox 360 AND CoD: Ghosts for Xbox One to your licenses, so your Gamertag account permanently owns the rights to
 download that game at any time.</p>
<p>You should have no trouble downloading Ghosts for XB1 when you get it come November. :)</p>
<p>For peace of mind here's a reference page from Activision/Call of Duty in which I grabbed the info from:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Call-of-Duty-Ghosts-Next-Gen-Upgrade-FAQ/?l=en_US&amp;c=Game_Title:All&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Call-of-Duty-Ghosts-Next-Gen-Upgrade-FAQ/?l=en_US&amp;c=Game_Title:All&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1</a></p>

<h3> summerluv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 wifi won&#39;t automatically connect on startup</h2>
                    <p>When I first got my computer around Jan. 20, 2015 I had no problem with the wifi automatically connecting when starting up the computer for the first time in the morning. Now recently I would say past couple weeks, every time I start up the computer for
 the first time the wifi isn't automatically connecting and it seems like the computer isn't even making an effort to connect. I've troubleshooted the connection at which it resets the adapter and things work fine. Other times I've had to just got into the
 sidebar and click the network name and connect and it connects. I'm wondering why it's not auto connecting on it's own. My computer is completely updated via windows update. I've even went into device manager and updated the driver for my network adapter.
 Still same problem. I've went as far as completely resetting my wireless router and reconfigured the whole thing. I've made sure when connecting to the network there is a checkmark in connect automatically. What now?</p>

<h2>            How do I restore my Inbox.bak from my Recycle Bin to my Inbox&#63;</h2>
                    Using Windows XP and Outlook Express. I received a window to "compact messages" to save disc space. Ran that and lost all 2010 Inbox e-mails.&nbsp; 2008 and 2009 e-mails still in the Inbox. Tried to find a solution in the forums and was able to find the Inbox.bak
 in the Recycle Bin. Files says " Modified: Yesterday, July 13, 2010, 6:41:29 PM". I'm not sure if that was before or after the compacting. I clicked "restore" which eliminated the folder and did not bring back the missing e-mails. I searched and found the
 Inbox.bak and now have the file as a desktop icon. How do I restore my missing e-mails?

 Before then I was using Microsoft 2007. When I sent my DA my draft dissertation with my 2007 Microsoft Word,&nbsp; her feedback was more about formatting issues that were not there in my original document. For example, some paragraphs had different fonts, some
 images went missing, some pages went blank just to name a few, yet the original document that I had sent her did not have any of this. Well, the first thing that came to my mind was that maybe it was a formatting glitch as the Microsoft Word that I was using
 (2007) was not compatible with the one she is using. That's when I downloaded the Microsoft 365 tools from the student portal of UoL.</span><br />

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />If different versions of software is being used to open your documents that you've sent, there's no real way to ensure 100% of the formatting is identical.
<br />
<br />One thing you could try though, is saving the document as a PDF before sending it. A PDF will always preserve 100% of the formatting. Hopefully your recipients can accept PDF files.
<br />
<br />Here's a guide to saving as PDF:

    <title>Mapped network drive letters conflict with external storage &#47; USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> his_dudeness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mapped network drive letters conflict with external storage &#47; USB keys</h2>
                    
<p>I have mapped a number of network drives in Windows 7 (drive F: to J:). Whenever I insert a USB key it gets a drive letter from one of the mapped network drives, rendering the network drive itself inaccessible (in fact, the drive is still shown as a mapped
 network drive, only does it contain the USB key data).</p>
<p>I think this problem is known at least since Windows XP. I even found a hotfix for Windows XP but it seems it hasn't been fixed yet in Windows 7.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I would love to find a solution that doesn't force me to assign V: to Z: to my network drives to make room for the USB keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>we have had this problem also and use USBDLM to solve it. It is a service that you install and it 'redirects' the usb to available letters if the one they want to use is already taken by a network drive or another usb. see link below</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into my new laptop</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop 2 weeks ago and set it up as per screen instructions. &nbsp;Which meant setting up outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to to use said laptop today and it outlook wouldn't accept my password. &nbsp;I went through all the required channels regarding security questions.</p>
<p>However, I had to submit a form requesting certain information. e.g. XBOX card no, (which I haven't got) emails I have sent etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a new laptop, I haven't used it to send emails, just general set up. &nbsp;Microsoft are now coming back saying I don't have enough information for them to reset my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean I am left with a brand new laptop I cannot use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone has some advise out there.</p>

<p>Hey, I have recently been experiencing some problems with Windows Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>Every 15 minutes or so, I will get a message in the action center saying that I need to re-enable automatic updates. I press "automatic updates" (the one with the admin icon next to it), and fyi, I am logged in as admin. &nbsp;And then, 15 minutes give or take,
 I will get the same message. Any ideas how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey, man, it sounds like you've got a hijackware infection on your hands. I'd "wipe &amp; reload" if I were you.</p>
<p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the HDD &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;
<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>HOW TO do a clean install of Win7: See "Using the Custom installation option and formatting the hard disk" section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7#section_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7#section_7</a></p>
<p>After the clean install, you'll have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of everything on the following page before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet
<em>or a network</em> (i.e., other computers) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and before using a flash drive or SDCard that isn't brand-new or hasn't been freshly formatted</span>:</p>

<br />
Tip: If &amp; when you reinstall AVG Free v9.0, select the CUSTOM install option and do NOT install (i.e., uncheck) Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active Surf-Shield, Security toolbar, or any of the email scanning components.</p>

Personally, I'd&nbsp;install Microsoft Security Essentials or Avira AntiVir or even Avast5 (all free) instead of AVG but it's your computer.</p>

<h2>            ACROBAT READER DC DOWNLOADED TO WINDOWS 8.1 NOT RESPONDING</h2>
                    <p>I have spent the entire morning installing and uninstall Adobe Acrobat Reader DC on my Windows 8.1 OS. I&nbsp;pull up a document and then try to "sign &amp; fill in" and I get the Adobe "not responding" error message.</p>
<p>I really want an older version of Adobe Reader, but every time I go to the older version link online, I get the download</p>
<p>for the DC version.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have Windows 10, nor do I want it.&nbsp; I also do not have a smart phone or an ipad.</p>
<p>I don't need all the bells and whistles. I simply want to be able to make changes to genealogical forms, etc.</p>
<p>I hate having&nbsp; things forced on me. </p>
<p>I had an older version of the reader, but it too kept giving me the "not responding" message so I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>I have been using the Microsoft Reader and was able to type in on some forms, &nbsp;but now cannot type in or fill in on that too.
</p>
<p>as of this morning.&nbsp; I cannot find an on the Microsoft Reader to&nbsp;click to do so. This morning when I downloaded an 1860's blank census form.&nbsp; And pulled it up and saved it to the Microsoft Reader and now it will not let me fill in the form.&nbsp;If there is a
 way to fill in on the Microsoft reader, please give me instructions on how to do this. I'm 70 years old and I'm</p>
<p>not a happy camper.</p>

    <title>DLC on my games. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyukittybeanz  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLC on my games.</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought borderlands awhile ago, and now I went back to play the game and noticed there is some expensive DLC for the game. I feel like I'm missing out on half the game now. I think I could rebuy the game in collectors editor or game of the year and still
 be cheaper than buying the content from live.</p>

<p>Then I go to play Halo 3 online and see that I'm missing 90% of the multiplayer maps. -.-</p>

<p>I bought Black Ops not to long ago for $50, and now there is $50 worth of DLC to get.</p>

<p>My other games all have some extra stuff that cost money to.</p>

<p>Does ever xbox game sold have extra DLC that you have to pay for after release? I want to buy dead island but it's $65 with tax and I'm worried that there will be more stuff added in some months so maybe I'm better off waiting until games come out with another
 release with everything at a lower price. Does Mass Effect 2 have any of this? That's another game I was buying soon.</p>

<p>You need to select "Use rich formatting" down at the bottom and it lets me do different paragraphs, that's assuming you are using IE or Firefox. &nbsp;Not so sure about other browsers.</p>
<p>It seems the best bang for the buck is getting the special releases after the game is out for a while. &nbsp;Take Oblivion for example there are tons of DLC for that game. &nbsp;No way would I recommend getting the regular game and then buy all the DLC. &nbsp;Eventhough
 the DLC over time does go down in price (sometimes), the best bang is finding the editions that include a bunch of DLC with the game.</p>
<p>ME 2 does have some DLC, but doesn't have any special editions that I am aware of to take advantage of.</p>

<p>its just a matter of waiting for the price drop when buying games and dlc.i`m sure some of the borderlands dlc was cheaper recently.</p>
<p>one way to do paragraphs is to hold shift and press enter to seperate them,doesn`t always work though.</p>

<p>Well, you never have to buy the DLC, as in, it isn't required to play the game, in my honest opinion I think that you get $60 worth of gameplay just from the regular game, and anything that you want to buy afterward is just added content that you can buy
 if you want, but it shouldn't have to be free, otherwise they could just sell $100 games if that would be better. (this is just my opinion, I don't actually think they should make $100 games)</p>

<p>I just press Enter twice while in Rich Text to get paragraphs. OT: It does get a little ridiculous at times. But I haven't bought any paid DLC since Halo 2, and I've been enjoying my games just fine without them. The problem is with games like Halo, where
 you get locked out of most of the playlists if you don't have all the DLC. Adding content is one thing, but restricting the content I already have at the same time is just wrong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not required in most cases however I have run into problems in some games playing with friends who have DLC if I do not buy it. Also while it is not required in most games, it still feels like a lot is missing. Especially when companies hold stuff back
 just to release as map packs. Usually when i find a game with a lot of DLC to be bought, I end up passing on it. You can call these 100.00 games if you would like however just a generation ago, almost every DLC pack released was free of charge. Now days, Microsoft
 does not allow free DLC even if companies want it that way. Epic and Valve are good examples of this and Valve sells L4D 2 with full DLC for cheaper than Microsoft makes them charge just for the packs. When they run their sales, you can get the full game with
 DLC for cheaper than just one of the Xbox DLC packs.</p>

<p>I've been playing Borderlands, and the DLC isn't neccessary at all. It's a long, well made game by itself. It's there for people who like the game and want to keep playing it, with new adventures, etc.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I bought all the DLC for Fallout 3. Original game was worth way more than 60 bucks, the DLC just made the game that much better. It's simply there to extend the game for people who enjoy it. Not a neccesssity.</p>

            <p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed several troubleshooting guides... including disconnecting all peripherals, disabling most device drivers and attempting a manual installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update I'm trying to install is&nbsp;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607.</p>

            <p>You're already on the right track. Here are the additional troubleshooting steps that you can try to solve the issue regarding Windows Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the <strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter </strong>
to automatically address the issue. To get started, click this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>and select <strong>Download troubleshooter for Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Start your PC in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> and try to install the updates. Since the drivers and
 files that are being used is limited, it can also help you eliminate what's stopping Windows from finishing its update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Stop the Windows Update related Services and restart it.
</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Search </strong>bar, type <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Right-click it from the result and select<strong> Run as administrator</strong>.
</li><li>Type the following command:<strong> net stop wuauserv</strong> and <strong>net stop bits</strong> then press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Once you are done, open the<strong> File Explorer </strong>and navigate to this folder:
<strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</strong></li><li>Delete its content and restart your PC.</li><li>If in case you cannot delete the content because it is being used, restart your PC. Go to the folder again and delete all the files and folders in it then restart your PC again.
</li><li>After restarting, open the <strong>Command Prompt </strong>and type the following command:
<strong>net start wuauserv </strong>and <strong>net start bits </strong>and press
<strong>Enter </strong>to start the Windows Update Service.</li><li>Run the Windows Update again and check if the issue still persist.</li></ol>
<p>We'll wait for the end result. </p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest performing a clean boot to identify and eliminate software conflicts when trying to install updates. Refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for more information on how to perform a clean boot in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to: <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</strong>to know how you can start your computer in normal mode after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also disable Antivirus and security-related products. If you have any Antivirus installed for (Free) uninstall it, if not, then disable the Antivirus and try to update again and see if issue will be resolved.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and/or troubleshoot
 any pertinent issue, you should reactivate it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>

    <title>IVP6 format for internet connection with FE80 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melissagrzymkowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            IVP6 format for internet connection with FE80</h2>
                    Just wanted to share, because I at first thought my internet access was being intercepted by a foreign IP address:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>IVP6 which Comcast uses for its internet signal now is routed by a local IP address that begins with:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FE80...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a local area routing station, NOT a foreign IP address as I was told by a Microsoft Employee. Would also like to note that I was told that my computer was now accessible by this 'foreign IP address'. THIS IS NOT TRUE PEOPLE. Your computers are
 safe. IVP6 internet connections used by COMCAST and possible by other internet access companies are now routed thru this LOCAL ACCESS which begins with FE80.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft first told me this misinformation, then tried to connect me to a 'associate' that tried to get me to buy a $1000 plus internet protection plan! I, of course said NO THANKS. And luckily pursued this issue on my own. Not even the techs at my internet
 company knew this information. Thank goodness for a friend who is a computer engineer and the internet or I would have been stressing about my information being hacked! Even went so far as contacting the abuse line for COMCAST. Felt like a fool as my engineer
 friend was gone for that week I sent the email, but oh well live and learn.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Search terms on the internet before deciding what I thought was correct from a Microsoft Tech! Don't let them scare you into thinking that you are in danger. It is a ploy to get more money from you. Don't you think we pay enough between internet access,
 virus protection, buying computers (then new ones 2 years later because the cost of fixing a computer is almost as much as buying a new one)!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Good luck and be forewarned,</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Even though I am a MVP and Community Moderator I do not speak for nor represent Microsoft<br />
or the Microsoft Community Forum Management.<br />
<br />
Instead of a ploy I would chalk that up to some not understanding how the new IPV6 allocations<br />
are assigned. Trust me it won't be the last time someone with a professional computer company<br />
makes this mistake. And that includes Comcast themselves. :)<br />
<br />
Very good that you pursued it yourself though.<br />

            An IPv6 story ....<br />
<br />
Several months ago, I started noticing that many sites were taking a long time to display (minutes). The problem was intermittent .... some times the sites would display immediately, at other times it could take minutes.<br />
<br />
At first I attributed it to heavy Internet traffic, busy sites, etc. But the problem persisted, and remained intermittent. When it was happening, many major and well-known sites took minutes to start loading (i.e., when it happened, the delay was not limited
 to one site).<br />
<br />
The problem occurred on Firefox, IE, and Chrome, and on several computers on my home network. Using speed testing sites, I verified that (once connected) I was getting the proper upload/download speeds. Using the network monitor in Firefox, I determined that
 the delay was not caused by DNS lookup, but was happening after DNS lookup and when a request for connection was sent to the website I was opening. That request was taking minutes for a reply.<br />
<br />
I finally read an article about IPv6 rollout, and how many companies were supporting IPv6 in their network, but did not yet have all of their workload balancing and performance enhancing infrastructure configured on their IPv6 enabled routers. The article (sorry,
 I have lost track of its source) went on to say that the symptom could be poor performance when accessing a site via IPv6.<br />
<br />
I also found this Microsoft article on how to disable IPv6 (or its components) in Windows:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852/en-us</a><br />
I used the "Prefer IPv4 over IPv6" Fixit (50410).<br />
<br />
<br />
I use Firefox as my browser and (using "about:config") I set the <b>network.dns.disableIPv6</b> parameter to TRUE<br />
<br />
<br />
After making the above changes, the "delay" problem went away and (after about a month) has not returned.<br />
<br />
I mention all of this in case anyone reading this thread is experiencing a similar intermittent "delay" when opening web sites. Both of the above changes are easily reversed:&nbsp; the Microsoft page also has a "Prefer IPv6 over IPv6" Fixit (50441) and Firefox's
<b>network.dns.disableIPv6</b> parameter can easily be set back to FALSE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><b>CAVEAT</b>:&nbsp; by making the above changes, you will not be able to view a web page from a site that is
<b>IPv6 only</b>. This has not been a problem for me (most commercial sites that support IPv6 also still support IPv4 ... and will likely continue to do so for years). There are many
<b>IPv6 only</b> sites being used for testing ... if you make the above changes and access one of those sites, you will get "server not found" message. To try it, search on "IPv6 only sites" to find URLs of sites that only support IPv6. When (years from now)
 the Internet drops support for IPv4, then the above changes will have to be backed off.<span><br />

            Hi Lanqware,<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updated network drivers. Also check any 3rd party antivirus/security<br />
programs or other programs which can affect network performance.<br />
<br />
You want to be able to enable IPV6 if possible.<br />

            Thanks Rob.<br />
<br />
The "delay" problem manifested itself as follows:&nbsp; periodically (at least 5 to 10 times per day, sometimes more) every attempt to open a new web site resulted in the connection attempt just waiting. I could open a new tab in my browser, try a different web
 site and its connection attempt would wait. I could open several tabs (for different sites) and each would do the same. I could try another browser ... same results. I could try another computer ... same results. After awhile (one to 5 minutes) the connections
 on all tabs would complete. Then the problem would go away and all would be fine (immediate connections) ... until the next random occurrence.
<br />
<br />
When I was troubleshooting the "delay" problem, I did make sure my drivers (and other system software) were up to date. I ran my browsers in "safe" mode (i.e., all add-ons disabled). I have the same ISP as the OP, and thought that perhaps my ISP was doing something
 to precipitate the problem. I checked the signal levels in my cable modem when the problem was occurring ... all levels within spec. ISP came and checked my wiring, all ok. I changed my default DNS lookup servers to use Google's DNS servers (not my ISP's servers)
 ... problem remained. I also temporarily disabled my AV software (and its firewall) ... problem remained. I tried doing a tracert to the web sites that were not responding .... no conclusive results (what I did notice is that when the "delay" problem was underway,
 and most web sites were not responding in my browsers, a tracert to the corresponding sites would also not respond).
<br />
<br />
I tried everything I could think of, and the problem remained .... until I finally made the changes mentioned above ....&nbsp; then the problem stopped occurring.
<br />
<br />
I have several computers on my home network. After making changes on the first computer (setting it to prefer IPv4 over IPv6) the problem ceased on that computer .... but the other computer (that still preferred IPv6) continued to have the problem ... until
 I made the changes on it.<br />
<br />
It's been over a month since I made the changes .... the "delay" problem has not returned, and I have not noticed any negative effects (i.e., not gotten any "server not found" messages when trying to access a web site ... at this point in the IPv6 rollout,
 I doubt if there are many IPv6 only sites that are other than for testing purposes.).<br />
<br />
I agree ... at some point in the future, when IPv6 is ubiquitous and support for IPv4 is about to be dropped, I will have to undo the changes I made. I think we are many years away from that point. I probably won't wait that long .... I'll probably wait several
 months, undo the changes, and see if the "delay" problem returns. <br />
<br />
I suspect the problem is caused by a combination of some backbone routers not being properly configured and/or properly converted to dual IPv4/IPv6 mode, along with some companies not having their performance and load balancing infrastructure completely set
 up on their IPv6 capable routers. The result being that a request for connection using an IPv6 address takes a sub-optimal path, may not be properly routed across all load balanced servers, and/or possibly times out before the client (my PC) makes an equivalent
 IPv4 DNS lookup and tries another connection attempt with IPv4 (waiting for an IPv6 connection attempt to time out and retrying with IPv4 may take 1 to 5 minutes .... accounting for the delay I was seeing).<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well the delay could be a combination of issues however I would look first to your network<br />
drivers where the translation takes place and also to your local router firmware. It would not<br />
surprise me if drivers and&nbsp;firmware are not updated as quickly as they should be as long as<br />
they work yet produce delays. <br />
<br />
Yes it will be a long long long time before IPV4 goes away.<br />

            <blockquote>It would not<br />

</blockquote>
Agreed.<br />
<br />
My network drivers and router's firmware are both up to date.<br />
<br />
The "delay" problem I was seeing started around last October. At that time, neither drivers nor firmware had been changed. I could not associate the "delay" problem with any change that took place in my environment .... and (to make matters worse) ... the delay
 problem would come and go randomly (as if some factor external to my environment were the root cause ... I was never able to correlate the problem with anything happening on my PCs).
<br />
<br />
Making the changes I mentioned above had an immediate result ... in that once the changes were made on a given PC, the problem did not re-occur on that PC (but did re-ocur on other PCs at home until they too were subject to the changes).<br />
<br />
A search on "IPv6 performance problems" makes for some interesting reading. I think we both agree, IPv4 will be around for awhile.<br />

            Hello Robmeister,<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting.&nbsp; It seems that you might not have the driver installed for your Tape Drive.&nbsp; You can check this by clicking on start/Windows Orb, then click on Control panel.&nbsp; Once in Control Panel, (depending on view selected) you would select "Hardware
 and Sound" then Device Manager or just Device manager.&nbsp; Once in Device Manager, just check to see if your Tape drive is listed.&nbsp; If not then you will need to install the proper driver for it.&nbsp; The drivers should have come on a Disc with the Tape Drive or you
 can also download it from the manufacter's website.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.<br />
<br />

What application do you use to backup? Do you use the Windows Utility? When you go to Computer, do you see it listed as one of your hard drives?<br />
Also, if you can provide the brand and model of your computer so we can see what specific type of tape drive you are using.</p>

            <p>Hello Nitin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to connect Samsung mobile phone via usb cable on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you installed the necessary software provided by the phone manufacturer?<br />
2. What are the troubleshooting steps that you have tried?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>When you connect a new device to your computer, Windows automatically tries to install it for you and will notify you if a driver for the device can't be found. There are several things you can try if this happens:</p>
<p>What to do when a device isn't installed properly<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/what-to-do-when-a-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/what-to-do-when-a-device-isnt-installed-properly</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> </p>
<p>If the above steps does not resolve the issue try to download and install the latest software from manufacturer.</p>
<p>Install the latest software from the disk or from manufacturer website.<br />
Click on the download link given below to install the software for the mobile phone.<br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/support/model/GT-S7562ZKATML-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/in/support/model/GT-S7562ZKATML-downloads</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all connect your phone with data cable to computer with a data cable. Then connect your computer with internet and install Samsung kies. After this go to windows update and here check for windows update and the see there should be two drivers update
 from Samsung publisher install those 2 drivers and after installing these drivers restart the computer and&nbsp; connect your mobile phone &amp; as it is an android phone turn on usb debugging/usb storage mode .</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>If the above method does not work follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to connect the phone via USB, then try to check the status of USB device controllers in device manager. And if you have a yellow warning on the USB device then try to update the driver software by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Right click on the USB device.<br />
b) Select Update the Driver Software<br />
c) Install them. If you get an error code then reply us with the error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>If the above steps does not resolve the issue follow the article from Samsung.</p>

</p><p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

 the manufacturer&nbsp;</a>of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.</li></ul>

<p>I just realized I made a huge mistake. One of my recent upgrades was the case to my desktop. And I didn't think to save my product key sticker from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to verify my identity and fix Windows? Or would it just be better to buy a new copy of Windows 10?</p>

<p>Microsoft published a knowledge base article on the activation process. In your case it states that you should have received a digital license whether it be Home or Pro. Because you said you preformed the free upgrade, Win7 to Win10. Have you made some major
 change to the PC, like a motherboard swap? Looks like a call to Microsoft.</p>

            That's it. According to the activation policy, a board change is significant enough to warrant a call to Microsoft to validate you are a owner of a license. Do you still have the Windows 7 key information? I suspect you might need it when you make the
 call.

            Hi&nbsp;Anugerah,
<div><br />
<div>We have not seen a problem with a clean installation of ExpressCache on a Windows 8 machine. As reported, there is a problem that we encountered with the Microsoft "Upgrade" process from Windows 7 to Windows 8. In this case you would need to uninstall
 ExpressCache prior to upgrading and then proceed to reinstall ExpressCache after the upgrade to Windows 8. This issue is currently being investigated by Microsoft.</div>

            Hi there,
<div>I actually have the same issue. I used to get the "HFS not mounted" info, after a reinstall of the newest EC drivers/software I`m getting "You do not have enough privilege to run this program. ECCMD exited with error 0x5 (5). It really sucks that neither
 Samsung, Condusiv Technologies nor You could prepare the OS and the drivers so, that they actually work, before releasing them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Just for your information- installing Win8 from USB memory is rather impossible, but from USB-DVD-drive it went normally. This also was really annoying, because I had to &nbsp;buy one specially for the installation.<br />
<br />
<div>So please give me a hint, how to get out of this trouble and let me finally enjoy this nice OS but WITH EC ;)</div>
<div><br />

            I got the device driver working but I don't think EC is functioning in the system..<br />
0% read and right? something wrong..<br />
<br />
By the way to make EC driver work you need to delete the partition of issd drive and make it unallocated then install EC. EC will create the partition for you..<br />
