</p><p>If this cannot be resolved and I have to buy a new wifi card so be it, but I don't want to replace perfectly functioning hardware for no reason, so a simple update on when this will be resolved would be much appreciated by me and obviously many other people

            <p>Hi Sangeeta Sarkar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you misunderstood my question... The problem is not about the services for Windows Update but an issue with incompatibility of a driver for the broadcom wifi/bluetooth card. Nor Broadcom nor Samsung want to update this driver. With windows 8.1, this
 driver is working properly but windows 10&nbsp; cannot digest this driver. So, I'm asking Microsoft to include the rewriting of this driver in a new build of Windows 10 ! Because the last build doesn't work until now.</p>

<p>I have the whole backup, consisting of “Backup Set yyyy-mm-dd ID#xxxxxxx”, which contains the “Catalogs” folder, containing the files “Backup files 1.wbcat” through “Backup files 638.wbcat” and files “Backup files 1.wbverify” through “Backup files 638.wbverify”,
 and the zipped files folders “Backup files 1.zip” through “Backup files 638.zip”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to recreate the “GlobalCatalog.wbcat” by somehow assembling the individual “*.wbcat” files?</p>

<div><br />
<div>As for the other links, I’ve already seen most of the discussions. They deal with the missing “MediaID.bin” file and how to recreate it from the “GlobalCatalog.wbpac” file. I have not been able to succeed in that regard. But I have not seen any discussion
 of repairing or reassembling the “GlobalCatalog.wbpc” file in order to be able to recreated the “MediaID.bin” file.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I know the Backup program generates the file ““GlobalCatalog.wbcat” &nbsp;automatically.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unlike other backup apps, there is no “Backup Job” option in the MS system. It is simply a consumer-oriented one click “Backup files” deal. Even if I could recreated the global catalogue, the problem is that it would not know to point to the hundreds of
 constituent catalogues that contain all the information about the files that were backed up. I need to know what mechanism exists to connect the individual catalog files to the global catalog.</div>

<h2>            explorer.exe keep spinning new processes</h2>
                    I have expreinced a problem with explorer.exe on Windows 7 latest RC load.. I have jar file and I wanted to open with explorer similar to any zip file.. The jar files are not assigned by default to be opened by windows explorer, so I tried assigning the
 jar to open with c:\windows\explorer.exe.. That casued explorer to keep spinning new processes endlessly.. I only had to logout and log back in to fix this probelm..<br />
First, I know that maybe what I did was not correct, but at least explorer shouldn't keep spinning new prcesses like that.. can you fix this?<br />
Secondly, What's the correct executable that I should use to open jar files (similar to zip files) inside windows explorer?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><span>Hello, winuser7</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Explorer does not open the zip files, a plugin does.</span></p>
<p><span>Since jar files are similar to zip files you may be able to change the association, but it is possible that there will be unknown side effects from doing so. You may want to
 use a program specifically designed to open that type of file.</span></p>
<p><span>If you wish to change the association, you do so at your own risk. You can change the association by going to Start, All Programs, Accessories, right click the Command Prompt
 and choose Run as Administrator. You may be prompted to continue. In the Command Prompt type the following command and press enter:
<strong><span>assoc .jar=CompressedFolder</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>To change it back to the default, the command would be:
<strong><span>assoc .jar=jarfile</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>

    <title>Installing Windows 7 on Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wilhelm_ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 7 on Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD</h2>
                    <p>I've spent two weeks trying to do this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, Windows 7 can't be installed on a NVMe device because it doesn't come with the drivers for it nor the ability to recognize those drivers, so you have to install some hotfixes (hotfix KB2990941 and hotfix 3087873) and the drivers for your NVMe
 device onto a bootable USB yourself using DISM via the administrator command prompt. &nbsp;However, because I have a Gigabyte mobo, I am provided with a tool from gigabyte that automatically does all this without any need to use the command prompt. &nbsp;You simply
 put the drivers you need to be installed in the same folder as the tool and they're put on the bootable USB along with the hotfix. &nbsp;After I did this, unfortunately, the windows installer gave me the black screen with white text telling me that a critical system
 driver was missing and, low and behold, it was called "nvme.sys". &nbsp;Next I tried doing it the long and painful way by using the administrator command prompt to mount boot.wim and install.wim onto my laptop and then installed the hotfix and driver manually to
 both of those mounted .wim files and then unmounted them back onto the bootable USB(still using the command prompt). &nbsp;Before I unmounted them I even checked the very file destination that the driver was apparently missing from just to see that it was, in fact,
 right there where it is supposed to be (windows\system32\drivers\nvme.sys). &nbsp;So, knowing that the driver was right where it was supposed to be, knowing that the hotfix had been properly installed, and knowing that the driver for the 950 Pro was installed,
 I tried to boot windows from the USB again only to get the exact same error message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A critical system driver is missing: (windows\system32\nvme.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It completely blew my mind and infuriated me because I had literally just seen the file right where the installer telling me it wasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming the installer didn't recognize the driver because of something involving the hotfixes and their installation I searched around and found this guide I followed here:&nbsp;https://ftp.hp.com/pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/whitepapers/Windows_7_OS_Install_NVME.pdf</p>
<p>to learn that there was another hotfix called KB2908783(in addition to the two that came with the gigabyte tool) which I proceeded to install onto boot.wim and install.wim. &nbsp;However, in the section of the guide explaining how to extract hotfix KB3087873
 and using the file "update-bf.mum" as the package to add, command prompt gave me an error saying that the update was not applicable to the image (which is install.wim). &nbsp;It's not applicable to boot.wim either. &nbsp;I just kinda ignored this since I assumed that
 it was already installed if it wasn't applicable, but obviously I was wrong since I got the exact same results. &nbsp;I also tried installing the entire KB3087873 hotfix (not just update-bf.mum) and got the same result. &nbsp;I have no clue why Windows refuses to recognize
 the driver. &nbsp;I've contacted gigabyte and samsung on this issue and it got me nowhere; they just told me things I had already tried and I believe this situation has become too complex for any samsung or gigabyte representative so this is my very last resort.
 &nbsp;What do you guys recommend I do at this point?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other important info:</p>
<p>-I had previously tried to format the 950 pro to be recognized in windows while my computer was working but accidentally wiped all data off of my older PNY SSD (that had windows installed on it) by deleting a RAID volume (that included the PNY SSD and the
 950) and changing it back to AHCI format</p>
<p>-the 950 is recognized as a bootable drive in BIOS</p>
<p>-all my windows files on the USB are from a legitimately purchased disk</p>
<p>-I unplugged all other drives besides the NVMe ssd when attempting to install</p>
<p>-the USB is the #1 boot option in BIOS</p>
<p>-I haven't changed any other BIOS options (prime category for possible solution?)</p>
<p>-the exact error I'm getting is "0xc000035a"</p>
<p>-I am going schizophrenic from this disaster<br />
</p>

<p>I had the same problem. the hotfixes I found were lengthy, difficult, and didn't work. I downloaded hotfix from here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2990941/update-to-add-native-driver-support-in-nvm-express-in-windows-7-and-wi#bookmark-prerequisite</p>
<p>&nbsp;but it would not work for me. so, instead of lengthy&nbsp;process, I opened the hotfix from within my windows 7 platform on old HDD. Ran it. allowed restart. Now Win 7 could recognize the drive, but the win 7 setup program still did not. So back in old win 7
 installation I downloaded and ran Aomei partitioning software (free):</p>
<p>&nbsp; https://www.aomeitech.com/aomei-partition-assistant.html</p>
<p>clicked on copy disk. checked box "optimize for SSD" ran it. Aomei shut the PC down, and copied drive in pre-OS environment. it restarted when done. Now OS was on the drive. After restart I opened easy BCD. downloaded free version from here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/</p>
<p>ran it. clicked on add new entry. chose a name and type. pointed it to SSD drive. clicked on edit boot menu. chose my new entry. made it default boot device. saved information. restarted and it booted to new SSD drive&nbsp;after a quick automatic repair from
 Aomei in pre-OS. Then I used Aomei to wipe old HDD for storage use. Done! I tried for a week every solution I could find. This worked in less than an hour. most of that time was cloning the drive. All steps were pretty easy with point and click software doing
 most of the work!</p>

    <title>Problems with Loss of Realtek Wireless LAN after 8.1 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelwillie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Loss of Realtek Wireless LAN after 8.1 Upgrade</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Lap Top computer that I purchased in July of 2013, that came with Windows 8 already on it. It was upgraded to 8.1 in December of 2013. The Toshiba Software updates advised me that the Wireless LAN from Realtek needed&nbsp;to
 be updated but I had to uninstall it before it could be updated. Once I uninstalled it I had no internet, other that USB port. My question is where or not this is something that can be fixed by using the factory re-install software? The people at Toshiba would
 best be described as less than helpful. Where can I locate the latest Realtek software that for the Wireless LAN?

    <title>Too many hackers on this game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Too many hackers on this game</h2>
                    
<p>They won't stop freezing games. There is no way that is good for the xbox freezing it, there are so many kids who freeze every game they join. I've been frozen by
<strong>[MOD EDIT]</strong>multiple times now, all his noob friends leave just before the game is frozen every time. I have also been frozen by
<strong>[MOD EDIT] </strong><strong>[MOD EDIT]</strong>, and <strong>[MOD EDIT]</strong>. Those are just some names I have on hand I get frozen every time I play this game. Not only is it annoying that I have to have my xbox damaged, but also avoid player doesn't
 keep them from joining my game, and filing a complaint obviously doesn't do anything because there is a hacker in every game I join. GTA IV is one of the easiest games I have ever played yet there is so many noobs who have to hack to kill people.</p>
<p>Hackers always join games so if their friends get killed they can be chivalrous nerds and get revenge by cheaply killing or freezing the game. Too many hackers are crybabies and have to get upset and freeze the game. Is anything to be done about this?</p>
<p>Also its way too cheap when hackers get in an APC, the invincible vehicles hack needs to be patched. If you take away that they can't drive super fast in cars either because the car will just instantly break.</p>
<p>Hackers shouldn't be in public games, if there was an actual way to report hackers and have something done about it they would only be in private games with their friends not causing an issue. Hackers freezing xboxs could be causing potential damage, which
 is a liability. If the hackers would just be banned for going in public games this would be fixed.</p>

<p>This is why when you see many videos on YouTube, it clearly says "We/I tested the hacks in a private match" or "I don't have an unfair advantage over others". The people you are talking about are noobs and I am as annoyed with them as you are. What's really
 anoying is that the hackers have an ability to join a Private/Party Session when the "Join Session in Progress" or "Join Party" option isn't available. The same noob (I can't remember the name) joined my game me and my friends had to practise Piloting, and
 he had a boat which flew like a helicopter. Weird thing was that he started doing drive-bys with RPG rockets and once I jumped out of my helicopter (which was above the hovering boat) and landed on the boat, he magically killed me while he was in the drivers
 seat. For starters, how could he have shot me when driving and for seconds, how could he have blowed me, and all the other helicopters (my mates) flying &nbsp;nearby WITH AN RPG, when you can't fire one when your driving? Weird. Leave some feedback!</p>

<p>Please don't name and shame on a forum. It's against the rules. Well, if they leave before the guy freezes teh game, you should do too. Unfortunately, you have two options: 1) Mod your Xbox and install mod killers (so you can kill them and get revenge) or
 2) Find another lobby. I'm not trying to teach people to mod or anything, nor am I for modding but sadly, this is what it has come to.</p>

<p>He has a modded pistol or sub machine gun the fires RPG rockets. I'm sick of these jerks that can't fly, drive, shoot to save their lives so they mod and freeze. Ban them all for good. NO creating a new account, NO buying a new console, if you get banned
 for modding there should be no way to get back on Xbox live. NO exceptions.</p>

<p>In a PERFECT WORLD, that's exactly what would happen. However, hackers/modders (both partake in the same activity) will ALWAYS be present. Micorsoft can only ban a HANDFUL of them, but MOST of them are actually smarter than "the system". True; banning a
 modder/hacker may deter them momentarily, but the truth is they will always come back using either: 1) A new Xbox, 2) A new account, 3) An Unbanner program. If you are unsure what that is, an unbanner can and will unban a banned Xbox. This is the primary method
 that hackers/modders use to unban themselves from perma-bans. Not only that, some of these programs are easily accessible PUBLICLY over Modding websites. The only downside is the modder/hacker needs an Xbox that is not banned so it does hurt their wallet somewhat.
 However, there are people who will play by the rules and those who will not. This has been hinted by works of Plato and the Ancient Greeks. Aristotle even said: "I do things even though I know they are wrong, yet I do them anyway." It can also bec considered
 "playstyle" however, modding/hacking is considered a "playstyle" that is frowned upon by Microsoft and most gaming companies. You would think logically that Microsoft would be able to handle this but there are literally 100s upon 1000s of modders/hackers,
 and due the increase in popularity and importance of technology, being a hacker can easily be defined as "someone who has exceptional knowledge of computers and the way the technology works. In order to be a hacker, all you need to know is how the equipment
 works and how technology, especially computers today work. It's very complicated however, which is why you have only a few. To finish this off, I'll tell you what is actually happening when you get frozen: When you get frozen in a game, it is because the hacker
 has flooded your IP Address with packets of information, tons of it. When you play online, your information is sent between the server and your router/computer via packets. If the hacker "floods" your router with more packets than necessary, you freeze. It
 is simply an annoyance in my opinion, and one good way to avoid this is to either: 1) Play with COPS ON and FRIENDLY FIRE OFF (these settings deter modders/hackers), or 2) Stay in PRIVATE MATCHES WITH FRIENDS. I hope you all have learned a lot today, and for
 the record I am not a hacker/modder, nor a supporter of modders/hackers/modding/hacking. I'm am just very intelligent and knowledgeable on the subject of modding/hacking.</p>

<p>Yous seem to know your stuff, but your theories however are not logical, its not Microsofts responobility, its Rockstar norths's, they need to get off their lazy drunk butts and patch the mods, yet Ive come to find out that Rockstar is a team of developers
 who are for modifications, so were basically surrounded, just players who cant take a couple seconds to find ways to do good without cheating, so they just do what they want, think about it, GTA is the king of cheat codes when it comes to games, Rockstar dosent
 care about the loyal money spending fans that basically sign their checks. They care about money</p>

<p>@TBM KRAK SHOT, I question why you think Rockstar is responsible. How is it not Microsoft's responsibility? Are they not the ones that are supposed to be monitoring the servers? Does the XBL PET Team NOT enforce violations of the Code of Conduct under modifying?
 If I remember correctly, there were several banned accounts pertaining to modifications of game content. How then can you say it is Rockstar's job? Yes, they can make a patch, but it is ultimately Microsoft's responsibility to ban the modders. So it is Microsoft
 that should "get off their lazy drunk butts" and ban the modders.</p>

<p>I think the modding will never be stopped on GTA IV because the game is already out for nearly four years and pretty much, they are making GTA V. So, don't expect a patch to come through and fix everything unfournatley. Hopefully, there will be a banning
 system for GTA V and Max Payne 3. They already have it in Red Dead Redemption. Lets hope they will increase their power to stop modders from spreading onto other games. People are not going to take modding anymore, take action.</p>

<p>I agree, GTAMissions; a lot of people are beginning to hate modders. But let me throw a curveball if I may. What if the modder is not a douche and actually just uses mods to spawn rare vehicles? Do we still hate them?</p>

            <p>To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.</p>
<p>065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted</p>
<p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p>Validate Now:</p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS DEFENDER ADVANCED THREAT PROTECTION</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to start the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection.&nbsp; It begins to start but almost immediately stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a message from Services that reads: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Service service on Local Computer started and then stopped.&nbsp; Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand that.&nbsp; Of course it's not in use because I'm unable to start it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to include a screen shot but I don't know how to upload it.&nbsp; Would like directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            BSOD - System service Exception on shut down and GPU crashes</h2>
                    I've been getting this error for a couple of weeks now and I was wondering what's the fix. I've read numerous fixes but none of them worked for me. I think its one of all the drivers on my PC but I cant figure out which. At first i thought it was my intel
 GPU cause it overloads and comes up with BSOD and error igdkmd64.sys but its drivers are up to date..Or at least thats what it tells me :p

            There arent any newer drivers for the mouse, and I have used it with windows 10 for quite a while before it started crashing (like, at least a month)... I tried reinstall drivers right now, restarting still BSOD me.

            You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.

<h2>            MISSING MFC70.DLL won&#39;t allow me to play my old game on windows 8.1</h2>
                    Can someone please tell me <u><b>directly </b></u>what to do about this? <i>
<u><b>I'm not very technical</b></u></i>. I'm trying to play my old game called "Fahrenheit" but a little box titled system error appears to say the program won't start because mfc70.dll is missing from my computer. It worked fine on my old PC but not on this
 new windows 8.1.
<div>There is a thread on here which answers this question for windows 2007 and even gives a link. Unfortunately this is NO help for windows 8.1</div>
<div>Please, please Help!<br />
&nbsp;Thanks in advance.</div>

            <p>Devotion when I started just because of how easy it was&nbsp;to pick up and use and has range of a sniper. Also does a good bit of damage to titans if played right.</p><p>L Star is my fav now. Sound reminds me of a Halo Needler. This one melts specters and pilots quicker than most guns.</p><p>Softball just because it is hilarious to use against campers watching them scramble in a panic.</p><p><br /></p><p>It really boils down to your play style the weapon that best and will take you a bit but, you'll find that special one that just clicks.</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>it all depends on your fighting style. if your a camper which no one really likes then use the eva shotgun or mastodaon. for range i like the g2a5 or the hemlock. for close range i like the alternator or the car. my all around favorite is the hemlock because it is a 3 round burst and can be used for all different ranges. i have to agree with cyclingguynola i also love the devotion cause if you use it right that gun can be a nightmare to the other team. for perks i bounce between the grappling hook and the pulse knife.</p>

            <p>Devotion is great, although its range and accuracy has been wound back a little.

            <p>I'm a huge fan of the R-201.&nbsp; The accuracy is very good (close bullet grouping, even using it long range) and it's damage is decent.&nbsp; However it's downfall is the ammo capacity.&nbsp; You'll need to use it until you unlock the Ammo capacity upgrade. With the ammo upgrade, it is an excellent choice.&nbsp; My second choice would be the LSTAR.&nbsp; It seems overpowered to me, but it overheats pretty quick.&nbsp; Good Luck!</p>

<h3> igor luizol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fails to boot every time a power outage occurs after Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Recently, I updated my PC to Fall Creators Update. Everything was fine concerning perfomance and the new features. However, two days ago I had a power outage at home and after power was restored, Windows 10 couldn't boot properly
 at startup and I was stuck in a Startup Repair loop.<br />
<br />
After trying every option at available at Advanced Startup Options (including chkdsk and bootrec through Cmd), the only thing that managed to make the PC boot properly again was using System Restore to revert to a previous point.<br />
<br />
Again, it was all working fine. But today morning there was another power outage and the issue was a back. Again, the only thing that fixed it was restoring to a previous point.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I don't have Windows installation media as I got Windows 10 during the Free Download period.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I didn't have this problem on previous updates and I assume it's not a BIOS problem since using System Restore fixes it. So, I would really like to know what's been causing it and how could I fix it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows 10 Specs</strong><br />
<strong>Edition:</strong> Windows 10 Pro 64bit</p>
<p><strong>Version: </strong>1709<br />
<strong>OS Build: </strong>16299.64<br />
<br />
<strong>PC Specs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte GA-78LMT-S2</p>
<strong>CPU: </strong>AMD FX-6300 Six-Core 3.50 GHz
<p><strong>G</strong><strong>PU:</strong> Gigabyte NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC 4G</p>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;8GB</p>
<p><strong>Storage:&nbsp;</strong>HDD 1TB<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Edit: </em></strong>Turns out that the power outages were not the culprit. Windows would faiI to boot anytime the PC restarted after a major update. So, I gave up and did a clean install of Windows. I haven't had this issue again since.</p>

            Hi Igor.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would run a full Disk Check to see if the file System has been compromised:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If so run drive diagnostics on the hard drive too:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/313457-seatools-dos-windows-how-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/313457-sea...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi chrisjchrisj, please try this:
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and try running that installer again
<br />
<br />Please Note, do not leave Controlled Folder Access permanently disabled . . .

    <title>Windows 8.1 desktop incons and task bar icons not visible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamedwardb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 desktop incons and task bar icons not visible</h2>
                    So here's the situation.<br />
&nbsp; Whenever I start my HP laptop, it boots fine and starts as expected. But, the Firefox icon in the Start menu doesn't load, nor does the name. None of the desktop shortcuts load. The same goes for the icons I had pinned to the Task Bar. Also, whenever I do
 open a program and minimize it, it doesn't minimize to the Task Bar so I have no way of restoring the window. It's not catastrophic, but immensely annoying and bothersome. I can get my shortcuts to load by Right-Clicking the desktop &gt; Sort By &gt; whatever I
 chose to select. However, the shortcuts are gone the next time I start my computer up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this issue is caused due to user profile corruption. Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error code or error message while startup?</p>
<p>3. How many user account do you have on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>If the issue started recently, then Restore the computer to previous date before the issue started and check.</p>
<p><strong>How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to the section "<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in Clean Boot state and check if the issue persists. This will help you determine if the issue is caused due to any third party program/app.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7 or in Windows 8/8.1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> After clean boot troubleshooting step, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer
 to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Create a new user account and check if it helps. This is to check if the issue is caused due user profile corruption or not. If the issue does not persist in new user account, then proceed with
<strong>Steps 2 </strong>and <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong>Create a new Microsoft Account.<br />
<strong><span>Create a user account:</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the new user profile works properly, then copy and paste the data files to the new user profile.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to copy the files from the old Microsoft account to the new Microsoft account:
<br />
</span>a) Press/tap <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows
</span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">x</span></strong> together and select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Explorer</span></strong>.<br />
b) Click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View
</span></strong>tab and click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Options</span></strong> at the top right corner.<br />
c) Click/tap the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View</span></strong> tab, and then click/tap
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Show hidden files</span></strong>, folders, and drives.<br />
d) Uncheck the box which states <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hide protected operating system files</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes
</span></strong>to confirm, and then click<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong>.
<br />
f) Locate the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\Old_Username folder</span></strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile
 you want to copy files from.<br />
g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:<br />
•<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ntuser.dat</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.dat.log</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>h) Right click/tap and Select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy</span></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 3</span></strong>: If the new user profile is working fine, then delete the old user.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to delete the corrupted user account profile:<br />
</span>a) Login to your new User Profile.<br />
b) Click/tap on the “<strong>Windows logo</strong>” and type “<strong>User Accounts</strong>”.<br />
c) Now, select “<strong>Settings</strong>” and then select the “<strong>User Accounts</strong>” icon.<br />
d) Click/tap on “<strong>Manage another account</strong>” and then select the user account that you want to delete.<br />
e) Click/tap on “<strong>delete the account</strong>”.<br />
f) Depending on whether you want to “<strong>Keep the files</strong>” or “<strong>delete the files</strong>” choose the appropriate option.<br />
g) You can delete the other accounts similarly.</p>

<h2>            Get error &#34;8007007F &#34; when trying to install update.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 8.1 Updates / PC Settings / Task Manager / User Accounts &amp; Administrator Rights</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP laptop is only a year old &amp; came with Windows 8.1 installed.&nbsp; I have Norton internet security installed. &nbsp;It was fine until a few months ago when web pages started to freeze on me.&nbsp; When I tried to&nbsp;access the Task Manager to close the pc down I discovered
 I couldn't get into it.&nbsp; I also discovered I could not access the pc settings or the Windows Store; when I try&nbsp;they briefly flash on the screen &amp; then immediately go to the task bar with nothing opened.&nbsp; I have automatic updates turned on &amp; when I checked
 for updates&nbsp;I discovered no updates had been done since August &amp; there are 60 important updates to be done.&nbsp; Even though I'm administrator I also cannot access anything that is related to the administrator.&nbsp; When I try to update or change anything it says
 C:\Windows\system 32 is not programmed for that procedure.&nbsp; When I tried&nbsp;to install Windows Updates I received error code 8007007F.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am able to go into command prompt only as a user, not as administrator.&nbsp; It almost seems the pc is going to my user profile
 instead of the system profile...I'm not a techie so I'm only guessing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now since I can't get to the settings, updates or administrator accounts I'm afraid its going to crash on me if the updates aren't done soon.&nbsp; I've thought about a complete restore
 to manufacture settings but I can't even do that without administrator rights.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you help me?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues using your Windows 8.1 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run
 the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span><span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Gamerscore</h2>
                    
<p>I just got my account back from Microsoft today after a 2 week investigation took place because somebody hacked into my account. I went to recover my gamertag about70000legit and my gamerscore was drastically lowered to a simple 45g when i had well over
 70,000 gamerscore so i called xbox customer support and 2 support reps hung up on me and told me it was impossible to get the gamerscore back. when i told them that it wasn't. i know it is not impossible to get the score back because inleast 12 microsoft xbox
 customer support professional reps told me that when i got my account back after waiting a long 2 weeks that everything would be back the way it was and my gamerscore would return to my hard earned 70k. i thought i was just going to give up but i decided to
 call customer support one more time... i then met the nicest customer support rep i have ever encountered on customer support. she told me how it was and also told me i would be getting my gs back! she escalated the case today. i just dont understand how i
 was off at school for a year and some scumbag hacked my account and got away with it because i got my account back with a gamerscore that is nothing to what it once was at 70k, so it reality i am being punished for something i did not do... when somebody hacks
 into my account without my permission or my knowing and then when microsoft finally gets me my account back after weeks of waiting and i dont see my hard earned 70k i was so disapointed and angry you dont even know. the account had been escalated like i said
 and i hope to see the return of my gamerscore soon :-) I hope the&nbsp; Microsoft security and justice system will do what is right and get my gamerscore back for me.</p>
<p>thanks microsoft,</p>
