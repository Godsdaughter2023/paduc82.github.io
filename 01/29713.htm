<h2>            Windows 10, explorer, mapped drives not opening automatically</h2>
                    Hello, In windows 7 when I mapped a drive to a letter, explorer automatically opened to the drive letter I mapped. In windows 10 explorer does not open when I map a drive. I have to manually open explorer and navigate to the newly mapped drive. I am unable
 to find an option to set that will open mapped drives the moment they are mapped. Can anyone assist me?

            There's no option for this, sorry.&nbsp; Although if you click the "Map Drive" button on the toolbar, you are already there and will see your new drive appear just below, ready to be clicked on right after you map it.

            <p>I started getting this error in mid-December 2016; nothing I did would resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week I tried 'unchecking' all items listed under 'Advanced Options' selection; which is located on the Microsoft Windows 'Update Page.'&nbsp; On my computer there were three (3) boxes there to uncheck.&nbsp;&nbsp; This page can be reached through 'Settings' which
 is located under the 'All Programs' selection area on the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, the update process worked OK; and the available updates were installed satisfactorily......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not explain why this worked; but I gather Microsoft has been working on its noted 'Update Issues' recently.....</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft community. Thank you for posting your query on community.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your interest in Windows 10. I will surely assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates after upgrading to Windows 10?</p>
2. Does this issue occur on a Local account or a Microsoft account?</div>
<div>3. Have you backed the data before upgrading to Windows 10?</div>
<div>4. Do you have the Windows.old folder present in the system?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the Admin account to check if that helps.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Keep us informed to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I also upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 and could not see my pictures, documents, videos, music, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the issue stems from my old computer being run as Administrator as the old account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I had to do on Windows 10 was to get signed in as the Administrator instead of just "user".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are located in Local Disk (C:) - Users - Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason it said it didn't have access to this folder and it kept trying to open buy timed out.&nbsp; Finally it did open and there were my files.&nbsp; I have attached pictures.</p>

            <p>the problem seems to be that windows starts as a temporary account&nbsp;</p>
<p>i found my documents and transferred them by mistake to this new account&nbsp;</p>
<p>after restart this account was deleted with all my files</p>
<p>
</p><p>so when you upgrade or install updates and your files are not in place</p>
<p>first restart your computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>this will solve the problem</p>

                    Hi all,&nbsp; I posted a question earlier and although I got immediate response and i have acted upon the advice, I still cannot go further than 18 minutes on a film. Does the zealous use of transitions limit the memory one needs to make a single film ?? Is
 there a loimit to the number of clips ??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP !!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You say you have 300 Gig on the drive? How much of that is FREE and is the free part on the<br />
same partition you are working on? I believe you need to 2-3 times the free area on the partition<br />
you are working on to properly do your task. i.e If you have a C: and D: partition and C: only<br />
has 2 gig free and D: and 150 gig free and you are working on C: then you are limited to its<br />
space and if you were working on D: there is much more space available. And if D: free space<br />
was small and C: had a lot then working on D: would also limit you.<br />
<br />
This utility will show you how space is used.<br />

    <title>Can a fixed magnifier resizable box option that doesn&#39;t follow the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smp2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can a fixed magnifier resizable box option that doesn&#39;t follow the mouse, but does magnify a specified area of the desktop done by mouse selection &#40;easiest&#41; or area &#40;harder&#41; be added to windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Ease of access magnifier option wanted.&nbsp; The one and very useful option that is missing is a resizable magnifying window that magnifies a specified area of the desktop, stays put and doesn't follow the mouse.&nbsp; Docked options or full screen options do not
 serve as a good substitute for this option.&nbsp; Sometimes a full screen option isn't convenient and the trouble with docked options is that they are too narrow and not put where the user would normally look while working.&nbsp; The only current solution is a resizable
 magnifier window that tracks the mouse.&nbsp; The problem here is distortion and distraction while working.&nbsp; It is better to be able to have a fixed adjustable magnifying window that can be moved around independently of the mouse tracking option and magnifies an
 area of the screen specified by the user.&nbsp; Much less distracting.&nbsp; Can this option be added to Windows 10?

            <p>If they were working before and quit, it's likely that your computer model requires a "listener" program to be running the background to listen for those keys and pass the command onward to Media Player.&nbsp; Many computers use this method of control, like Dell
 and HP, and you'll usually see an icon down by the clock representing this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However since it's specific to each model PC, can you let us know what model you have?&nbsp; You may also be able to find out from the manual or by contacting the manufacturer (they know what makes their special keys function better than we can).</p>

    <title>Windows Activation Failure and other Windows 10 issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave_itfieldtech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Activation Failure and other Windows 10 issues</h2>
                    <p>TLDR:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you purchase from the Windows store, and it says that you have a genuine copy of windows, but the Activation center says that your product key is invalid, restart your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Every time I boot my machine, my main screen cycles between the desktop and black screen, and I hear what sounds like device manager? Video driver? Crashing and restarting. Windows error logs show nothing.&nbsp;||&nbsp;<strong>After launching DXDiag, there seems
 to be an issue with DirectShow causing this</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Application menus are generally EXTREMELY slow to populate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Installing and starting programs that use some type of hardware acceleration causes the same issue as number 2 above (I have an NVidia GTX 980 graphics card)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Microsoft Edge is completely unusable since some sites which are mandatory for me to go to (work) use outdated tech that is designed for IE9.. yea, I know.. still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Outlook/Windows Mail is frustrating due to it's design/implementation</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Oculus DK2, I don't even want to try to get it to work with the issues I'm having atm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where should I start? At the beginning (this is both a feedback post and question/answer hopeful post):</p>
<p>
</p><p>After owning windows 7 for years, I had my product key on a data drive along with an image for doing rebuilds when I needed to (yearly/bi-yearly). Yesterday, the Windows upgrade was stuck in a hung state, probably due to having my %userprofile% on a separate
 drive, and libraries spread all over the place. Not too mention that I am a graphics design / motion graphics / game designer by trade, so I have one or two programs installed. Not too mention being an avid gamer myself...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Windows upgrade tool said I was good to go hardware-wise (obviously, being with what I use my PC for), I decided to just clean everything, all of my drives, and start fresh, as I didn't really have anything I couldn't live without. Seeing how the
 upgrade was hanging, I searched the web and found the method to create an ISO from the ESD file. I created the ISO, and rebooted to the installer EFI. I then went into the command prompt, and performed a "clean - create part pri - select part 1 - format quick
 fs=ntfs - active" on all of the drives using diskpart. Goodbye Data. It was nice having you along. I then proceeded to install Windows 10... and this is where the story starts to become a horrid nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to activate, as I had assumed that Windows created a product key and put it into my account, it would not activate. Great.. and I cannot rollback to Windows7 as I do not have a hard copy of it, and I wiped my ISO. Who needs $215 USD anyways?
 So I click on the purchase button on the Activation screen, which then took me to the Microsoft store, and I purchased via PayPal. After the purchase, the Windows Store said that I now had a copy of a genuine Windows OS.. yay? So why did I still have the "Activate
 Windows" mark on my main screen? And why does the Activation center say that my product code is invalid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched all of the places on the microsoft and live domains that hold product keys, and my Windows 10 product key isn't listed anywhere (this is a problem that is not resolved, still, btw).. So I contacted the sales team, and here we go. The first sales
 rep told me that because it was purchased through the Windows Store, he could not look up the order number, and he transferred the chat to a Windows Store rep. The Windows Store rep could not find my order number, even though the Windows Store app said that
 the purchase was completed. I also received the confirmation emails from Windows and PayPal about the transaction. So at this point, he directs me to technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being on "hold" for technical support for 3 hours (keep in mind during this time, I am re-installing all of my programs - Autodesk Design and Creation Suite, Adobe CS6 Master Collection, Unreal Engine 4 + Marketplace items, World Machine + plugins,
 Substance Designer/Painter + B2M, not too mention re-downloading all of my purchases from VideoCoPilot and 3dsMax plugins).. when I finally got a person in chat, I had re-installed approx 175gb worth of programs + stock media files, and had started setting
 up the programs. I told her what the issue was, and she recommended that I do a clean install, back to windows 7, get all of the drivers and everything updated, and do the upgrade again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained to her that I only had a digital copy of Windows 7, and that the product key was also a digital copy, and all of that was wiped since I did a clean install. And besides, that was not the issue. The issue was with the activation server not activating
 or storing my Windows 10 product key. She told me again to just "roll back to Windows 7" and re-install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last I checked, you couldn't exactly do a "roll back" from a clean install... but perhaps technology has changed in the last 5 minutes that allowed for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason, the "tech" decided that it must be a hardware issue, and that was why Windows 10 was not activating properly, nor were my product keys showing in any of the stores... &nbsp;So admittedly, I did get a little frustrated, and asked her if she
 knew what a clean install was, and to stop asking me to roll back, since I couldn't, and to either fix the issue (generate a product key and give it to me so I can put it into the Activation center and activate).. or I was going to process the charge as fraudulent
 through PayPal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She then asked if she could speak to a MS Store rep, and sure.. go ahead, however, I had to turn in for the night in a few minutes, so she had until then. At this point, she called me physically, so that we could conference in to a MS Store rep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, my computer was ready to be restarted.. so I did. When it rebooted, Windows Activation center said that my OS was activated and everything was good... ****. I apologized about the rudeness, and told her the solution so when she gets another
 call, she knows what to do.. and we hung up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing out applications, my games run like buttersilk, they are so smooth. DX12 ftw! The OS still "hangs" though, almost like it wants to cache both application and OS UI's. When I was installing programs that use hardware acceleration, my main screen goes
 black, and I hear, what I presume is the driver failing, then restarting.. however my other 2 screens are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I do a right click inside of an active window, the system hangs for a few milliseconds to a couple of seconds before it populates with the right click menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now let's talk about Windows Mail. HORRIBLE experience. Since there is no visible outline in the app, it took me forever (5 minutes, which is forever considering my job field + experience) to figure out how to get the preview pane to come up. A few things
 that is bad about it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Options menu: I have multiple accounts, personal and work.. I use signatures for both, however, mail will only let me use a single signature, not an account based one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Inbox Right Click Menu: There is a whole slew of things missing. Mark all as read, Create new folder, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Email "Rules".. does this even exist? I still haven't found it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the entire Windows Mail reader screams "I am just a reader for your email account".. and not an actual mail application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now onto Microsoft Edge.. while I do like the "clean" look of it, at times it is horribly unresponsive. Not too mention that none of the websites I have to go to for work actually work in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oculus DK2 support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a link to "Go to Full Control Panel" in the settings menu. Speaking of settings, device peripherals.. Windows 10 was hyped to be the best OS for gaming ever, so why couldn't the OS find the drivers for a logitech G19 gaming keyboard, or SaiTek
 X-55 Rhino HOTAS? Or flight pedals? Or the Marvel SATA controller? Again.. Oculus DK2 support...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, Windows 10 is actually worse than Windows 7, with the "lag" and other things just generally missing or completely wrong with the OS. And while I wouldn't harp on the OS being that this is basically "Day 1", I first installed Windows 7 as a "Day
 1" OS, and had no problems at all, and all of the drivers for everything even installed right off the bat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyways, there you go.. just my little experience with the OS.</p>

<h2>            How to disable fullscreen optimization.</h2>
                    Hi, I have been having issues with my fps being capped to 60 due to the full screen optimization I disabled it on one game and its stopped being capped but some games don't give me the option. Is there any way that I can disable full screen optimization
 completely from all my other applications through some setting?

<h3> denisakopyan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar is not responding&#47;Freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>My HP Envy 700 Series tower is in big trouble!</p>
<p>It seems to boot just fine, but after a while the taskbar stops responding - I can't click the start button or any of my pinned shortcuts.</p>
<p>Then I'm greeted by an error message which says that the taskbar is not responding. (I'll provide details later)</p>
<p>The message has only one button labeled End process.</p>
<p>Pressing that evil button leaves me with a depressive black screen and my cursor.</p>
<p>So basically the PC is unusable...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Technical details</p>
<p>Windows 10 (Upgraded from 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Good news!</p>
<p>It boots without this error in Safe Mode. </p>
<p>I've tried a couple of things, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>I'll try anything you suggest, even if I already have.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What the **** did I do to my PC?</p>
<p>Well... If there is a silicone ****, then I'm definitely going there for downloading unnecessary junk...</p>
<p>Anyway, this problem is caused by a very nasty virus.</p>
<p>It delivered the usual home page replacement on all browsers, except for Maxthon.</p>
<p>If my memory serves me well, it was <strong>istart</strong>.</p>
<p>Seemed to be just another annoying little virus, but removing it was a huge pain!</p>
<p>It reset the home page every time I booted the PC!</p>
<p>Malwarebytes helped along with Avast, but I had to remove some of the files manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that fix the virus was still present and affecting Chrome, so i decided to reset my PC to a point in time before I got the virus.</p>
<p>The reset was unsuccessful...</p>
<p>Then I finally found the rest of the menacing files and deleted them (+ from Recycle bin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">...Help!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Please help me resolve this unpleasant issue!<br />
I'll post details on the error as soon as I can.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">A full restore is not an option as for now.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Thank you!</p>
<p class="contentStandard" />

            <p><span>Hi Denis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that Taskbar is not responding on your Windows 10 PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to system conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the Methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system
 files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run
 the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            security code is 5 digits not 6</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to log on to Skype with my user name and password and it keeps coming up that Skype is not available right now, please try again</p>
<p>I received an email this morning from microsoft about an account and a security code and I did not know what it was. I figured out it was my Skype account but I already said that I did not want my email associated with that account. I don't know that it
 makes any difference since I do not log on with an email address just a user name. I updated to the latest version of Skype and followed the steps according to the troubleshooting screen but when I went back to look at the security code from the original email
 it was only 5 digits and not 6 like the screen kept saying I needed. What do I do now?</p>

============================<br />
Can you save the .jpg file to your desktop?<br />
<br />
If you can...try opening it in Windows Paint and re-saving it as a jpg.<br />

            You can try deleting and reinstalling the game. If that dose not work you might have to hard reset your system.if that dose not work then goto xbox.com/support.to speak to a support agent there.

            You should still only be charged the $1 CAD when you complete your transaction. The 16.99 is what your recurring monthyl charge will be after your current xbox live subscription ends.
