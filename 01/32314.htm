    <title>Lost all photographs when copying files from Windows 10 laptop to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost all photographs when copying files from Windows 10 laptop to Windows 10 desktop through external drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop with Windows 10 installed and an external drive (WD My Studio) for adding more storage since my desktop's SSD is a small capacity. I just recently upgrade my laptop to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p>I was trying to move all photographs stored in my laptop to my desktop. I connect my external drive to my laptop, made a new folder to the root folder of the external drive, and copied all the files (cut and paste, since it was quicker than copy and paste)
 to the new folders. After everything was copied, I safely remove my external drive, turn off the laptop, connect the external drive to my desktop, then turn on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, all of my photographs that I have stored earlier were lost. I couldn't find that new folder I made to store my photographs at the external drive, even after I check the 'hidden files' check box. All the other folders made before connecting
 my laptop were intact, no change whatsoever. Only that new folder which hold my photographs are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, a new hidden folder appeared in my external drive, which wasn't there before called "OneDrive Temp" and it consist only a fraction (less than 5%) of the photographs that I copied earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help on how I could find all my photographs. The photographs are really important memories that I have saved for 3 years. It would be heartbreaking if I lost all those files.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />2.Open Control Panel on your system. Then click on Troubleshooting option &gt;&gt; System and Security and then, click the Fix Problems with Windows Update option. then, select Trouble shot as an administrator.

            Hi Tom,
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click your iPhone or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!

<h3> x2rm5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista bootrec &#47;rebuildbcd and &#47;scanos commands shows total windows installations 0.</h2>
                    Vista&nbsp;fails to find os on startup. I've tried the bootrec.exe /fixmbr and /fixboot which complete. but when I run /rebuildbcd or /scanos I get the total windows installations 0. When I run bcdedit.exe /enum it lists the Bootmanager and Bootloader entries
 which appear to be correct: partition=c, Microsoft Windows Vista. I did notice the path: windows\system32\winload.exe and checked the system32 folder and did not find a winload.exe program. I then copied a winload.exe program from another Vista computer to
 the system32 folder, but still get the windows installation 0 message and cannot start up Vista. Exactly where and what does the rebuildbcd&nbsp; and scanos look for to see if it has a windows installation for the computer - which it does but they can't find it
 for some reason?

            Somehow - I don't really know how - just trying one thing after another - and finally got it to boot. Now however I get lots of missing or corrupt files. After fixing these I now get automatic system repair on startup that finds&nbsp;errors&nbsp;but doesn't know
 what the errors are. Therefore can't correct it if I don't know what it is. Guess I'll just have to reinstall to get it to work - which means I lose all my user data, as there is no backup available.&nbsp; Nice going Microsoft when you&nbsp;detect errors but even you
 don't know what&nbsp;they are. Thumbs down on your non-support.

            Thanks Andrew E for your reply. From my second post, I've gotten by the bootrec problem and can now find the Windows Vista installation and begin the startup procedure. However, the automatic startup repair program still runs and finds errors, but it says
 it could not find the cause of&nbsp;them. When I run the sfc /scannow command, I get the message "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation", even though I'm using an ID that is an administrator. I cannot use the Administrator ID because
 it says it is disabled on my system. I've run the chkdsk command several times and still get startup errors. Since startup repair can't tell me what the errors are I think all I can do is reinstsll Vista,&nbsp;but I think &nbsp;I'll just upgrade to Windows 7. Thanks

            <p>DVD drive does not normally appear in Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a System Repair disk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start globe (bottom left)</li><li>All programs</li><li>Maintenance</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>If this is a new install:</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you ever had to replace a failing hard drive and went through the long and complicated process of re-loading the operating system and all the necessary drivers, you will appreciate this.&nbsp; With this image, you will not need a Windows 7 install disk or
 a Microsoft Product key because this copy of Windows is already installed and activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has the built-in capability to create a complete image of your hard drive. Click on the start globe (bottom left), choose Maintenance, then “Backup and Restore.” In the next window click on “Create a System Image.” From there it is fairly easy.
 You will need a number of DVD blanks.&nbsp; Use <em><strong>only</strong> </em>DVD<strong> +</strong>R blanks (not -R).&nbsp; &nbsp;It could be quite a number. Also create a System Repair disk ( CD or DVD) from the same menu.&nbsp;
<em>Do this while your computer is healthy</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ideally, you should be making this image just after a Clean (Custom) install of Windows, after all Windows updates have been applied, and after you have loaded and updated all static programs like Microsoft Office.&nbsp; Do this BEFORE you load any other
 programs, or your data.&nbsp; This should keep the image to a manageable size.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will use this image to recover your system if you have to replace the hard drive or&nbsp;your existing drive if it has become so hopelessly corrupted or infected, that you need a fresh start. &nbsp;Boot with the System repair disk. Windows will be loaded to memory.
 You will have to find the option to recover from an image in the menus.&nbsp; But then the process will copy the system image to the new drive. The new drive will now be a literal clone of the old hard drive at the point in time you made the copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a new drive, it must be as large or larger than the old one.&nbsp; The restoration process will create a partition of the original size.&nbsp; If the new drive is larger, you can use Windows maintenance tools to extend the partition created.&nbsp; You
 can not use this image on a drive that is smaller than the one you are replacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best news of all is that the new drive will have the “Recovery Partition” that your computer’s manufacturer put on. Most other techniques will NOT put the recovery partition on. That is not good because someday, you may find your system has been corrupted
 (but the drive is still good) and you want to as simply as possible recover. That recovery process will destroy your data, but it will restore your operating system and really importantly, all the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may seem tempting to use a USB connected external hard drive instead of a whole pile of DVDs. However, this route is fraught with problems because Micrsoft Windows’ “Create a System Image” does not play nice with the latest hard drive technology. This
 is a well-known problem with no really good solutions. But, if you have an older external drive that still uses 512k sector sizes, the external hard drive may work well for you.&nbsp; Also the clone will monopolize the entire external HD and will erase everything
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had&nbsp;many cases in which I used this recovery system and it works like a charm and is very fast.&nbsp; The best way to do this is just after completing setup&nbsp;and all the&nbsp;updates, BEFORE data or volatile applications are loaded.&nbsp; That way it takes only&nbsp;4
 to&nbsp;6 DVDs.</p>

<h2>            error 0x80070780&#58; The file cannot be accessed by the system</h2>
                    I'm trying to access files on an external hard drive that have the following attributes:
<div>HSAPLO</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All the files and folders in the directory structure have icons with an X in the bottom left corner. This machine is running Win 8.0 64bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e0e0068-f04b-4314-8abf-3dc3712130a1" /></div>
<div>I've managed to remove the hidden and system attributes from one of the files and changed ownership but I cannot copy or access these files.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suspect the following:</div>
<div>These files were the original location for symbolic links to the Skydrive folder. In Win 8, it was possible to do this. Win 8.1 prevented symbolic links from being used in Skydrive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When doing a Windows update (this machine was running 8.1) I selected an optional driver update--I believe it was the Intel HD graphics driver. This update caused my screen to go black and I was unable to access Safe Mode requiring a rebuild of the system.
 Subsequently, I can no longer upgrade to 8.1 as I always get the black screen--the updated Intel HD graphics driver may be part of the latest Win 8.1 build whereas when I originally installed 8.1 the old Intel HD driver was included.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apart from the days of lost time rebuilding the system and failing twice to update to 8.1, I would like to retrieve my files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I do this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Hi Vijin,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>No. SkyDrive was in the default location on the laptop's internal drive. This default SkyDrive location had symlinks to the folder on the external drive which now has the file attribute problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The files are no longer on SkyDrive (cloud). Win 8.1 won't allow SkyDrive folder to have symlinks and I had upgraded to Win 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There's nothing particularly revealing about the General Tab. The details tab might be more useful.</div>

<div>I've played around with some of the powershell utilities but my knowledge is insufficient to remove the PLO file attributes and access the files. What I would like is a command to remove the PLO attributes. The file sizes are consistent with the original
 files (which were archived from the documents folder to the external drive-their current location) These original files in documents were lost when I was forced to factory restore my system following a Windows 8.1 update.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, Your suggestion on the screen drivers does not help. I am running Win 8 and there are no issues. It's only when I upgrade to Win 8.1 that the black screen occurs and there's no way (that I have found) to get into safe mode and change the
 drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a separate thread on the driver issue here, if you would like to assist.</div>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the details from your computer. Those definitely helped a lot in understanding the problem here. It appears to me that you had Windows 8 installed in the computer at a point and in that Windows 8 environment, you had a symbolic link
 in the Skydrive folder in your system drive to point to the external hard drive. Then you&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 8.1 and it was unsuccessful/broken. And finally, you reinstalled Windows 8 in the computer and you are still running that. However, now you do not
 have that same arrangement of Symbolic link for Skydrive. Please correct me if I understood it wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on&nbsp;this understanding of the scenario, this is the information that I can provide at the moment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attribute P refers that the file is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365503(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reparse Point</a>, the L attribute tells us that the file is a symbolic link and the O attribute means it is an Offline file that originated in a network source. These attributes were set to these files when this folder was the target of the Skydrive symbolic
 link you&nbsp;used in Windows 8 earlier. I believe you will not be able to change these attributes and recover these files as these attributes were set by&nbsp;the app when these files were in the Skydrive cloud space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am not very sure about is what happened to these files. These files were in your Skydrive folder and hence should have been automatically available in your Skydrive if the folders were all synced. Did you remove these files from your Skydrive manually
 at some point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that this information may not be encouraging. But if my understanding of the situation is correct, I believe we will not be able to access those files as some of the attributes are irreversible now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you need any further information, we will be glad to be of assistance. Thank you and have a good day ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, this is certainly not the answer I was hoping for.
<div><br />
<div>Your understanding in paragraph 1 is near enough for the purposes of this discussion.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Copies of these files are not available on SkyDrive (cloud) because I deleted them a month or so before this particular event. As mentioned previously, Win 8.0 allowed for the SkyDrive local folder to have symbolic links to the actual files and Win 8.1
 did not. I had intended to come up with another strategy for Win 8.1 and deleted the cloud files before starting a re-sync but never found an acceptable way to work with SkyDrive in Win 8.1 and put-off the project (I already had my files backed up to an external
 USB drive).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here was my scenario:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Actual files were in c:\users\xxxx\my documents</div>
<div>Copies of these files were/are on an external USB drive (backed up once per day)</div>
<div>Local SkyDrive had symlinks to the archived files on the external USB.</div>
<div>All appeared to work well</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I upgraded to Win 8.1 my SkyDrive setup failed because Win 8.1 no longer allows symlinks in the local SkyDrive folder. I just don't trust SkyDrive enough to allow it access to my original C:\user files. I think there's good reason for this as my predicament
 now shows that SkyDrive/MS has made perfectly good files inaccessible for the absurd reason of file attributes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My backup files are still on the external USB but inaccessible. The C: drive was factory restored after a driver upgrade rendered Win 8.1 inaccessible. I thought my files we backed-up on the ext USB (and they are) but I can get at them because of the file
 attributes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now that I'm back on Win 8.0, I could try re-linking these files and see if they get archived to the cloud.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, there might be some third party utility that can remove these "un-removable" file attributes. The file sizes indicate that the data is still there. If MS hasn't got a utility to remove the attributes, does anyone know of a vendor that does?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<li>Win 8: My Skydrive folder on local drive C: had simlinks pointing at some archived files on an external USB drive</li><li>Upgraded to Win 8.1 and found symlinks no longer supported so SkyDrive stopped syncing.</li><li>Deleted SkyDrive content prior to re-configuring my setup to not use symlinks</li><li>The above caused my archived files (on the external drive) to have weird file attributes HSAPLO</li><li>I can't access these files now</li></ol>
<p><strong>This is pretty ridiculous. SkyDrive has made my archived files inaccessible. I've been carefully backing up files for years and now those backed up files are LOST because I wanted to be extra secure and have backups in the cloud.</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think we can reverse these attributes. This is because these attributes were set by applications and the symbolic link arrangement that you had set for Skydrive file management. The fact that you had symbolic links connecting the data between Skydrive
 and the Backup folders resulted in this situation for those files after the OS environment was changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try using any third party data recovery software to see if those software can help recover these files? I think that is the best shot you have got at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards-</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Open Windows Explorer and right click the drive letter where the files are stored that cannot be backed up. Click Properties.</p>
<p>2. From the General tab click "Disk Cleanup".</p>
<p>3. On the Disk Cleanup window, switch to the More Options tab.</p>
<p>4. In the System Restore and Shadow Copies section, click "Clean up..."</p>
<p>5. Click Delete</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8.1 you have to click on "Clean up system files" in step 3 and make sure you have checked the recycle bin for deletion.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Paul's experience was not an anomaly -- I too&nbsp;am experiencing this same problem!&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't think I have ever, no matter the operating system (using&nbsp;Windows, Linux or Mac)&nbsp;experienced a data loss where in my files could not be recovered.&nbsp; Now because I wanted
 to be extra secure by backing my files up to my skydrive my&nbsp;files are inaccessible!&nbsp; Hopefully someone will be able to find a workaround so that I can access&nbsp;all of my personal photos again!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is utterly ridiculous that Microsoft would allow for something like this to happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone comes&nbsp;up with a way to get my files back please update this thread...for now I'll just leave the inaccessible files in place instead of following the "file clean up" suggestion that resulted in a total loss of Paul's data in hope that someone will
 come up with a&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            It really depends on what those "several contexts" are. In XP all administrative users are equal, including the built-in Administrator which is hidden in XP Home. So something else is causing the error. It can be when you try to install a program that
 isn't designed for XP or the computer could be infected. There isn't any way for me to know without more details.<br />
<br />
As for your feeling that your computer is clean because you have McAfee, you can't rely on that. Be sure:<br />

<br />
<br />
BTW, McAfee is one of the worst choices for protection. I recommend NOD32 (commercial) or Avast, Avira, or MS Security Essentials if you want a free program.

<p>Here are the two principal contexts:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Using MSCONFIG to do anything (after checking that I am an adminstrator), I get an error message stating that I "may" need to log in as adminstrator, which, I already am.&nbsp; Created several new administrator accounts, none worked.&nbsp; Tried&nbsp;several limited accounts,
 that didn't work.&nbsp; Tried everything again with McAfee turned off, same thing.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; McAfee continues to report that "Personal Information Protection" cannot be "configured" because I'm not logged in as an adminstrator.</p>

            Frankly, McAfee is the worst choice for protection. I would uninstall it and use something better. I recommend NOD32 (commercial) or Avast, Avira, or MS Security Essentials if you want free. After that, I'd do some thorough scanning per the steps set out
 in the link I already gave you. That way you know you're working from a clean base (which you don't know now). Don't skip the prep work.

            Thanks, but with all due respect, that's a cop-out.&nbsp; Microsoft has done its usual&nbsp;flimsy job of 1% engineering and 99% propaganda.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This is a simple question.&nbsp; I take&nbsp;it that the entire concept of user accounts has to do with restricting authority to make certain changes, and that being so, it ought not take more than a few clicks and a few seconds to determine the precise problem.&nbsp; In
 fact, it should have been detected the moment it occurred, and I should have been alerted.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let's not be bad-mouthing someone else unless you can give me more precise information about how they caused the problem.<br />

            Sorry, but you aren't understanding how the operating system works. It isn't a cop-out; it's that something is wrong with your system. Healthy Windows XP systems don't come up with those errors so something is wrong with yours. I gave you the first troubleshooting
 steps. If you don't want to do them to find out what's wrong, then there's nothing further I can add.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I was unable to help you and hope that you are able to get your Windows XP working again properly somehow.

<p>The simplest way of checking whether you have administrator privilege is to Right-Click on "Start".<br />
If one of the choices that pop up in the resulting window is "Open All Users", then you DO have administrator privilege.<br />
Simple.</p>
<p>As Malkeleah warned, simply having Administrator privilege does not automatically grant you access to everything.... and malware just loves to take privileges away from Administrators...</p>

<h2>            Music stops playing when monitor goes to sleep</h2>
                    Ok, I don't know if it is just my old computer (that I keep upgrading) but using Groove Music, when the monitor goes to sleep, the music stops. I can use Media Player or Zune and it will continue playing after the monitor goes to sleep, like it is supposed
 to, but Groove Music stops playing. As soon as I use the mouse or touch the keyboard, it starts again. But why does it stop in the first place? Is there a setting I am missing?

            I'm not happy with that answer. Never sleep mode is not desirable. There are lots of programs that don't induce hibernation when you don't touch the keyboard: Netflix, browsers streaming stuff etc. Groove Music should be able to manage that too. Some of
 us like our music, and for Groove Music to be a viable option, the music has to play on.<br />

<p>I am also not happy with this answer, as it doesn't even address the issue raised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not that it is stopping playing when the computer goes to sleep (which it does of course), but it is that it stops playing when the screen is turned off for power management reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been down the setting and it's set to high performance settings and it's set to turn nothing off apart from the screen. The question is why would power management turning the screen off cause an app to go to sleep and stop playing?</p>

            <p>This is complete nonsense - so you can't use your computer to play music continuously unless it's just programmed to never go to sleep? &nbsp;There's no way that's the correct answer. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>My computer just started doing this after the Groove July 2016 update. I just downloaded the Mixin Play app on my PC on it works fine like it has in the past during sleep mode.&nbsp; I just downloaded the app, I'm not actually using it, just to be clear.</p>

<p>So, what is the correct answer to this question? &nbsp;Is there a setting in Groove we are missing that will allow us to listen to music after the monitor goes into power saving mode? &nbsp;If not, then, the point you are missing is that we are asking for a feature
 enhancement to allow us to listen to music after the monitor goes into power saving mode.</p>

</p><p>Hello Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding to Leanna's question. &nbsp;However, since you asked about additional concerns ... let me add my voice to the choir who are NOT satisfied with the way the app behaves and your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you passed people's displeasure about computers going to sleep or hibernation while Groove is active up the ladder to the development team? &nbsp;I know one of the focuses of this forum is to offer instruction on how to make something work if someone doesn't
 understand it's features (and we appreciate that.) &nbsp;However, commenters in this thread already understand that Groove is working as designed. &nbsp;It is the design we are not satisfied with. &nbsp;To make Microsoft users happy, the only "fix" must come from Microsoft
 in the form of modifying the app so the computer will stay awake while the app is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modifying the code for Groove to keep the computer awake must be possible since other apps (such as Netflix) are able to keep the computer awake while their app is active. &nbsp;It is ludicrous to have to force the computer to stay awake when wanting to listen
 to music.</p>

<h2>            USB&#96;s stop working</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I gave faced an issue with USB ports performance on my laptop. There are 2 USB devices: headphones and a mouse.<br />
After a certain amount of time of use (the issue dies not appear if devices are idle) the mouse stops working while headphones keep working fine. After the mouse and headphones are being reconnected, headphones stop working and the laser of the mouse starts
 blinking in a cyclical manner: 1 short and 1 long blinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the laptop is being rebooted, devices work again. While making a troubleshooting I have discovered that the issue appears in the host controller Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26<br />
The manual restart from the device manager solves the issue, but only for the limited amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reviewing manage events I have noticed a following warning appeared the same moment the issue appeared.<br />
<br />
Warning 14.03.2018<br />
11:42:07 DeviceSetupManager<br />
123 is missing <br />
<br />
The DSM service was delayed by 23 seconds for a driver query/download/install on device "USB\VID_1038&amp;PID_1376&amp;MI_00\7&amp;36A3DFA1&amp;0&amp;0000"</p>
<p>(but i dont think that is a problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the latest updates are installed including KB4090913 which has the mention of this issue in the patch note.</p>

            Hi vDoms2,
<br />
<br />I would like to do a small test in order to better assess the situation. 
<br />
<br />-Please go to the "Power Options", this can be easily accessed by right clicking the windows symbol in the taskbar. 
<br />-Click "Change plan setting" of the current settings that you are using.
<br />-Click the "Change advanced power settings"
<br />-Scroll to USB settings and change from Enabled to Disabled.
<br />
<br />This is a test to see if the problem is when the computer tries to leverage the selective suspend on the USB.
<br />
<br />Let us know if that worked, we are here to help you.

            I went to Samsungs site and doesn't look like your hardware supports the creators update.
<br />Which would make sense with the chipset errors.
<br />I am so sorry for this.
<br /><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.samsung.com/us/support/windows10/</a>
<br />
<br />Try and revert back to previous build.
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-ba...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can do that then you will have to do a fresh install of Windows 10 and block the creators update.
<br />
<br />Below are 2 links.
<br />One on how to block creators and the other with Windows 10 ISO download.

<p>That would be from the memory card, not the profile.</p>
<p>You can't delete a gamer picture from your profile. You can only change it. On the console go to your profile in the My Xbox section of the dashboard and find the option to edit your profile. From there you'll see an option to change gamer pic.</p>

<h3> amberpuckett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wow &#40;World of Warcraft&#41;, and high Latency issues after updating to windows 10&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    After updating to windows 10 I have hate horrible game play at times and at others awesome. My question for Microsoft is why is it that my computer only reads up to windows 8 when trying to set compatibility for the game settings. This means my system
 is running two forms of windows at once and causes issues with data transfer rates. I need you to help in this matter. I have already updated every thing internally possible. Windows 10 is supposed to be the high tech version, but so far it has caused heartache
 after heartache. Cortana lags down all programs and even when I cut it off she comes right back on. Frustrated isn't the word. Help Please.

            <p>Hello Amber,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with game and Cortana on your system.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I would like to clarify you that when you try to set a game or any programs on compatibility mode, it will give you option to select legacy Windows version.&nbsp;It only means that you can run the program in older version of Windows mode. This doesn't
 mean you have two version of Windows on your system until and unless you have made dual boot operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for latency issue, you can try the below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>You can update your BIOS and graphic card drivers from the manufacturer website and check if it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further you can try the below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Right click on the <strong>Start menu </strong>and select <strong>Control Panel.</strong></p>
<p>2. Now select <strong>Power&nbsp;options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Now click on the drop down for <strong>Show additional Plans </strong><strong>under
</strong><strong>Power saver </strong>option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>High Performance</strong>. and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for Cortana, try to turn off Cortana by following the steps given in the link below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/switch-cortana-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Switch Cortana on or off</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>            Cheater Zone</h2>
                    
<p>I am just wandering if any body knows but I have been a member of xbox live for 4 years now and 1 year ago I got my zone labeled cheater zone. Now I have just finshed a game where I have got all the achievements legit but Im worred I will get reset or banned.
 Im also worried of staying on the account because I really want to continue getting achievements so should I stay on this account or not?</p>

<p>Hey there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ca2bbada-72d3-455f-9a31-886e36dd305f" title="Jah Simpson">Jah Simpson</a><span>,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Forums for clarity on how to connect and use a computer to the console to use as another game screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is called game streaming, and I can understand any confusion being experienced. The thing is that game streaming is currently unavailable for that OS, and can only be done with a Windows 10 PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about this feature, check out our support page entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-use-game-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use game streaming in the Xbox Console Companion app on Windows
 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>In order to get a Xbox One display on your Mac, you'll have to do more than just plug some cables together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't connect the Xbox HDMI cable to the computer, as the computer can't be used as an external display for another device (an exception would be Target Display Mode for Mac-to-Mac display).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stream the Xbox One game display to your Mac, you will have to install "OneCast" from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://onecast.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onecast.me/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That software is a similar streaming client like the Xbox app for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting up the software, make sure the software finds the Xbox One on the network, and then play.&nbsp;</p>
