<h2>            Windows 7 FTP Shortcut Icon</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have successfully mapped my FTP server to a few Windows 7 machines and it works like a charm. Honestly, couldn't have been easier! But, I am wondering if it is at all possible to change the icon of that FTP folder. I have created a shortcut onto the desktop
 of each and I do not have the option the standard "Shortcut" tab where I could normally change the icon.</p>
<p><br />
Your help is appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
<p><br />
Adam</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Adam,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. What options you are getting when you right click the shortcut and go to the properties window?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Are you getting any options under the shortcut tab or are they completely grayed out?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To select an icon to remind you of the folder's contents in Tiles, Icons, List, and Details views, click<strong><span>Change
 Icon</span></strong>. Thumbnails view also uses the folder icon if you do not specify a folder picture. You can select any image file that has an .ico file name extension, an icon in a program file that has an .exe file name extension, or an icon in a program
 library file that has a .dll file name extension to use for the folder icon. This option is not available when you customize a network share or a folder on a mapped network drive.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Son&#39;s account blocking Powerpoint. Can&#39;t authorise it&#63;</h2>
                    When my son tries to open Powerpoint on his account, it says it's blocked, though I haven't blocked any apps or Microsoft Office.&nbsp; When I try to authorise it using the pop up sign in window, the window just closes and he still can't open Powerpoint. What
 am I doing wrong? &nbsp;

            <p>Hi SusannahJH,<br />
<br />
For us to isolate the cause of this issue, please perform the steps below:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>1. Sign in&nbsp;at&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://fss.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://fss.live.com</span></a></span><span>
 using your Parent account.<br />
&nbsp;2. Click on <strong><span>Edit Settings</span></strong> under the username of your child.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong><span>App restrictions&nbsp;</span></strong>at the left menu panel.</span><br />
&nbsp;4. Tick&nbsp;the <strong>Turn off app restrictions (Activity reports will still be provided)</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;5. Click on <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
<br />
After turning it off, check if Powerpoint is still blocked. If not, I suggest that you turn it on and then double check the list of Blocked applications. It would also help if you can locate the blocked application that is causing this. Can you provide us the
 exact number of&nbsp;blocked applications?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi I would check your manufacture to see if you have the latest graphic driver.</p>
<p>Some times MS thinks they know about drivers then the manufacture. See if you can roll back the graphic driver in device manager to what is was before the last update! Let me know how things go!</p>

            It can take a significant time depending on the size of the disk and the severity of the damage if there is any. You didn't specify how long it has been at 11%.
<br />
<br />But for the sake of avoiding any further problems, leave it.

            Hi Inertia000 1 - NO i is not normal . . .
<br />
<br />If you have ran chkdsk with the /f flag only you can stop chkdsk and maybe start it again
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have ran chkdsk with the /r flag, you are best to wait and see if chkdsk completes
<br />
<br />If you stop chkdsk with the /r flag in Phase 1 or Phase 2, you run the risk of bricking your hard drive

            Yes and no can be answered depending on how much time you classify as being Long.
<br />If it is still stuck,
<br />Use Seatools to check the drive:

                    My caps lock is automatically turning itself on when I open certain applications.&nbsp; My initial thought was it was just saving whether my caps was on during last use, I have been unable to confirm this, but it is really irritating.&nbsp; Is this a "feature" that
 is supposed to be helpful or a bug?&nbsp; Is there any way of preventing/fixing this?

            Which applications are causing the issue exactly? If it is work you can do this to stop it: 
<br />1. Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing
<br />
<br />2. Autocorrect options &gt; Autocorrect options
<br />
<br />3. Uncheck "Correct accidental usage of CAPS LOCK key"

<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />This would be the preferred option
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            <p>Hello there, I have good news.</p>
<p>After three days of frustration and being hacked off, I turned on the PC this morning to see notifications that windows was making changes. After a few minutes, the wallpaper that I had in Windows 7, was back on my monitor. Windows also said that my files
 where exactly where I had left them. I looked and there were all my pictures and the rest of what I had.</p>
<p>So cheer up and expect a miracle.</p>

<p>Just now realized that our pictures and other documents have been lost.</p>
<p>Could NOT find any pictures or docs in the C:Windows.Old file, either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That means we've lost grandbaby pictures, tax records, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is NOT acceptable. </p>
<p>What can I do now - - just advise everyone we know NOT to upgrade to WIN 10?</p>

            <p>Just this morning I have read at least 10 posts from people who have lost data for one reason or another, and every one of whom had no backups.&nbsp; I sympathize with all of them, but there is no excuse for not having important data securely backed up.&nbsp; Aside
 from Windows 10 issues, there are a lot of things that can cause data loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard drive failure</li><li>Disk corruption</li><li>Lightening strikes</li><li>Power surges</li><li>PC power supply failure</li><li>Motherboard failure</li><li>Accidental overwriting of files</li></ul>
<p>There are more, but you get the idea.&nbsp; Any or all of these things may happen at any time, quite unexpectedly, and cause data to be permanently lost.&nbsp; If you value your files, back them up!</p>

 Also I just updated last night so I am not beyond the 30 day cut off. And did not do anything but log in for the first time. So no file clean ups or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Win 10 Update 1809 broke Win 7 Backup, resujlting in write-protected media error when media are fine with File HIstory&#63;</h2>
                    Many with this problem edit the registry, not ideal solutions almost certainly related to the Backup code.&nbsp; It cold be a profile? It is not hardware since I have 5 USB Western Digital drives and all work fine with File History.&nbsp; One irritating possibility
 is extracting the Backup 7 utility from the ISO for 1803.&nbsp; Another is to modify the profile.&nbsp; Microsoft has not informed their tech support crews, though they are aware of complaints that some customers claim data loss.&nbsp; Having not lost data for decades, I
 suspect that perhaps Microsoft is wondering whether they can afford to continue to support Backup 7?&nbsp; It has functionality that some developers prefer, such as multiuser backups and not requiring a layer of library folders.&nbsp; It appears that the "System Image
 Backup", which is used by File History users who want a system image, was also broken, and fails with the "Media Write Protected" error, though File History works.&nbsp; I only tried one network

            Hi Alpha.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in Settings &gt; Autosave.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller so they stay current if you need to reimage C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Inez.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About what version you're running which should be 1803.  Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install April Verison 1803 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Please explain the question in full complete sentences instead of sentence fragments.   
<br />
<br />I assumed you were referring to Disk Cleanup phase where it cleans up Windows Updates and that it was stuck there.  If that's what you were doing then the first thing to check over IS Windows Updates, next the System.   I've been doing this for ten years and helped over 100,000 consumers so am pretty knowledgable when there is polite cooperation and more than a few words thrown together to guide me.

            Happy surprise, I thought you were a canned answer didn't know you were human. So here is what happened. My computer is new, on the latest update of Windows 10 Home and I needed to install PDF Pro 10.&nbsp; First step was to uninstall previous version, which
 I did.&nbsp; Second step was to clear web browser's temporary internet files. I went to settings, delete browsing/history, checked all the boxes and hit delete. I got a progress bar and it stopped progressing after a couple of minutes then I waited about 3 hours
 with no more progress. I had to use Alt-Ctl-Del to close it.&nbsp; I was able to continue with what I wanted to do. But I'd like to know how to delete temporary files since the normal way didn't work.

            If the browser becomes or is dysfunctional, reset it in its advanced settings for internet options Advanced tab.<br /><br /><br />I would have several browsers to try because of his age is still being developed and some tasks require different browsers to be best<br /><br /><br />Type disk Cleanup in start search box, open and run disk cleanup to include system files.<br /><br />Be aware that edge browser is also a PDF reader, and that a more cooperative reader unless you need special functions might be Adobe Reader which is an old and reliable standby.

    <title>Question related to Password Reset on tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy_1993  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question related to Password Reset on tablet</h2>
                    I have forgotten the password for my tablet. Apparently this requires a password reset disk in order to change it, but since I obviously can't log on to my tablet, I had to create it from my laptop. This doesn't seem to have worked, and the steps seem
 to imply that in order to change the password, I need to create a password reset disk for the tablet, and that the password reset disk I created on the laptop can only be used to reset the password on the laptop. Both of these options are obviously really
 stupid. My question, therefore, is how do I reset my password?

    <title>Fix for update 1803 bricking system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scotlinkletter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fix for update 1803 bricking system</h2>
                    <p>Is there a fix in the works for systems that will not boot after installing update 1803?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer restarted, I had a black screen. The monitor wouldn't come out of sleep mode. I had to power down and unplug both the computer and monitor to get it back. Since then, the computer boots directly to the BIOS setup. Attempting startup repair,
 system restore, or rollback to previous version from a recovery disc or from and installation disk all fall. Attempts to use BOOTREC and BCDBOOT from either disc and a command prompt do nothing to make the windows installation bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems impossible to do an in-place installation when I can't boot into the current installation. Without some kind of fix, Microsoft just destroyed my system with a forced update. I have to do a clean install and lose everything. This was a free "upgrade"
 from Windows 7 so I'm not even certain the clean install will activate.</p>

            Hi Scot a clean install will activate,since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />
<br />However, what happens when you try to reset Windows - does it come up with an error, does it even start the process?

<p>I can't reset windows because it will not begin to boot. I can boot to an installation disc but that does not offer a Reboot option in the troubleshooting options. None of the options it does provide (like Startup Repair) work. Even going to a command prompt
 and manually attempting to replace boot files doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an error that comes up when booting from a disc.</p>
<p>"It looks like you started and upgrade and booted from installation media."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like the 1803 update didn't finish installing and never will.</p>

</p><p>Thanks. I had already seen that. Unfortunately, since Windows won't even begin to boot, I can't do an in-place install or really anything they recommended. I did get the installation ISO from another working computer.</p>

<p>I fixed it and am posting the answer in case anyone else needs it.</p>
<p>It turns out my problem wasn't in the windows partition. I suspect it was in the reserved partition.</p>
<p>I used GParted Live to copy the Windows position to the end of another hard drive. Then i reinstalled Windows from a DVD. That made the system bootable. Then I booted from the GParted Live disc and copied the original Windows partition back to the C drive.</p>
<p>Windows started right up just like it used to and I didn't lose anything. 1803 is not installed and Update shows one failed attempt to install it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 PC reports &#34;No audio device is installed&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pclancy360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC reports &#34;No audio device is installed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 PC with external audio device (Arcam DAC connected via USB). Was working perfectly for months, suddenly for no apparent reason a week ago the PC reported "No audio devices are installed".
<br />
<br />
Tried disconnecting &amp; reconnecting. Uninstalled &amp; reinstalled up-to-date drivers (and older drivers) several times with no success. Device Manager "sees" the external device but it doesn't show up in the audio "Playback Devices" dialog. Device Manager reports
 no problems with other or unknown devices.<br />
<br />
Tried uninstalling all USB devices, hub, etc in Device Manager then restarted to let Windows reinstall the correct drivers. This worked fine&nbsp;for the USB controllers, etc.&nbsp;but didn't help the audio problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried installing a *different* USB DAC&nbsp;to see if there was a problem with cables or the DAC itself. The installation ran smoothly and Device Manager reports the second DAC (which works fine on another Windows 10 PC)&nbsp;as correctly installed, but still Windows
 reports "No audio devices are installed". Tried different USB ports on the PC, no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the device is detected so the USB cable and the PC USB ports are unlikely to be at fault. The device works on a second PC, so it's not a fault with the external audio device either. This looks to me like a software issue in Windows, probably caused
 by a Windows update. But how to identify that and fix it?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, but the solution lay (apparently) elsewhere. I should have mentioned that the PC in question was being used as a headless music server. Access via Remote Desktop reported the problems described earlier, but when I connected a keyboard
 &amp; screen the problems disappeared. The issue seems to have been with the Remote Desktop config... Remote Audio Playback ('Local Resources' tab, Remote Audio section) was set to 'Do Not Play'. I changed this to 'Play on remote computer' and everything suddenly
 worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in any case.</p>

    <title>trouble with two monitors on Surface Pro 6 docking station - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webster13  say:</h3>
<h2>            trouble with two monitors on Surface Pro 6 docking station</h2>
                    <p>I recently added a second monitor to a new Surface Pro 6 connected via the new docking station.&nbsp; The second monitor frequently stops working (not responsive to unplugging and re-plugging; turning on and off, etc.) and sometimes even the primary one goes
 black on and off for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is recognized by the Surface Pro 6 so I have no idea why it keeps doing this.</p>

            <p>In regards to my question about Windows 10 hanging up at start up: I just had a local</p>
<p>GURU run a complete check on my HP Desktop and he came up with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>He reviewed the Microsoft Upgrades and found that a NVIDIA Video Display upgrade</p>
<p>failed to upgrade with the Microsoft Download on three different occasions, after seeing this in the download history file he went to NVIDIA's Website and downloaded drivers which fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you go to Settings, Update &amp; Security and check you History file</p>
<p>for down loads and see if they installed properly.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think you are better of heading to the TechNet Forum with this question, while also adding a better coherent description of your system and the problem.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 no longer detects my PCI-E video card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 no longer detects my PCI-E video card</h2>
                    I have been fighting with my Nvidia card in my newly upgraded (fron Vista 32 bit to 7 32 bit) for the last week.&nbsp; The device manager does not even list it.&nbsp; There was one point yesterday, after letting my computer sit for 4 hours, that when I came back,
 my 7600 GS was magically there in the device manager window I had left open.&nbsp; I updated the driver and tried to run a game.&nbsp; Then the screen went blank...no signal and I had to reboot.&nbsp; When it came back up, the 7600 was no longer there and no process of re-installing
 the drivers works...it says 'cannot find drivers that match your hardware.'&nbsp; Everything is set up in the BIOS correctly.&nbsp; This is that card that came installed in my Gateway computer.&nbsp; It was working fine with Vista (SP2) and I have tried to install drivers
 in compatibility mode to no avail.&nbsp; Help!

<p><span>Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I would suggest you to unplug the video card and plug it again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Try connecting the video card to different computer and check if it is working there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>I &nbsp;would Suggest you to run Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter and check if it helps, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the
</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span> button, and then clicking
</span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong><span>. In the search box, type
</span><strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong><span>, and then click
</span><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong><span>. Under
</span><strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong><span>, click
</span><strong><span>Configure a device</span></strong><span>.</span>‌<span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>You can also try manually checking for the drivers on Windows Update, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>Open </span><span>Windows</span><span> Update by clicking the </span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span> button. In the search box, type
</span><strong><span>Update</span></strong><span>, and then, in the list of results, click
</span><span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span><strong> Update</strong></span><span>.</span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click
<strong><span>Check for updates</span></strong>, and then wait while
<span>Windows</span> looks for the latest updates for your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are any available updates, click the link in the box under
<span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span><strong> Update</strong></span> to see more information about each update. Each type of update might include drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
<strong><span>Select the updates you want to install</span></strong> page, look for updates for your hardware devices, select the check box for each driver that you want to install, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. There might not be any driver updates available.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
<span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span><strong> Update</strong></span> page, click
<strong><span>Install updates</span></strong><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>

<p>Ok, so I have done all of this.&nbsp; I would love to know the manufacturer of the card if I could get the support from Gateway, but since they refuse to provide support any longer to my computer (E-4610D SB), I cannot find out the manufacturer.&nbsp; I have tried
 looking on the card itself, I have tried googling the serial numbers, model numbers&nbsp;and names printed on the card...nothing.<br />
<br />
Here is what I provided on the Nvidia forum:<br />
<br />
<em>My GeForce 7600 GS came with my Gateway (model# E-4610D SB). I had upgraded to Vista from XP about two months after purchasing the computer. I think I had the same issue with my GFX card when I did this, but Gateway supported my computer then (they will
 not now because they sold the division which supported my PC and the new company apparently went under.) I still have access to certain information but I can no longer get them to help me. I have been using Vista 32 bit for the past two years.<br />
<br />
I have recently upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 32 bit and I lost my graphics card again. I can only get a picture through the output on my onboard graphics chip. My Nvidia card is a PCI-E card. I only have one PCI-E slot on my motherboard. The downloaded
 drivers from Nvidia, Microsoft and Gateway all give me the error 'no drivers found that match your hardware.' In the BIOS, the PCI-E slot is selected. Under device manager, the only thing listed under display adapters is the Intel Chipset. Under 'other devices'
 it lists a pci device and controller with the yellow warning symbol. I assume this is my unidentifed GFX card. I have tried installing and updating drivers in every configuration as advised by others in several forums. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 the card in several different ways.<br />
<br />
Once, after letting my computer sit for four hours (I was frustrated with generic responses from Nvidia after being told over the phone by a Microsoft rep that is was a hardware issue) I noticed that my 7600 GS magically re-appeared in the display adapters
 under device manager. I ran the update drivers tool and voila! The monitor switched to the DVI inout. I thought It was a miracle...I tried to run the 'Avatar' game demo and the screen went black and told me no signal. I rebooted and I was back to no Nvidia
 card. Imagine that.<br />
<br />
So, since then I have performed a clean install after hours of backing up files to dvd...then tried to install the drivers...same issue. I even tried re-installing Vista, downloaded all updates...now my card does not work in Vista either...again. I am sure
 this is something simple...but no one seems to have the answer.<br />
<br />
Someone please help...I have Vista 32 bit on right now and am thinking if I can't get it to work, I might as well just go back to Windows 7...<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me get my card working again? It was working fine six days ago before I upgraded to 7...it is an outstanding card for my needs...and I cannot afford another one.<br />
<br />
And yes, I ran 'driver sweeper' in safe mode...what am I missing? Could the upgrade have damaged my card?
<br />

            You're not the only one with this problem which leads me to belive that it was some change in the registry that has crippled our Nvidia 7 series cards. Especially if you leave the computer and the chip begins to work again if only temporarily.<br />
&nbsp;My PC failed to find or locate the Galaxy 7200 GS card for my PCI-e slot on the 28'th of January upon trying to reboot computer after it had been shut down for several hours. The card is still using power based upon how warm it is even if I am plugged into
 the onboard Nvidia 6150 LE to use my PC.<br />
I contacted my chip manufacturer only to be told to contact windows or my PC builder for support on the PCI-e slot. I have seen this problem pop up on forums a few times in the last week, seems a strange coincidence that all our 7 series chips went bad the
 same time a windows 7 update is made.

Hi,<br />
<br />
This was my experience....<br />

<br />
I really do believe that the January 2010 optional nVidia update through Windows Update killed my PCIe slot.<br />

            Hi there
<div><br />
<div><span>Replying to this because exactly the same thing happened to me last week; set Windows updates to run &amp; automatically shut down then left it to get on with it. Came to turn it on a day or so later - heard the system
 boot up, heard the Windows music through the speakers - but not a peep from the monitor - absolutely nothing at all - the PC DOES boot as normal but DOES NOT wake the monitor up (although the monitor does it's diagnostic test when unplugged from the PC - so
 it knows when it's been disconnected).<br />
<br />
System info;<br />
Dell Dimension E521 - service tag 6TZ5Y2J.<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium SP2.<br />
Graphics card - Radeon X1300/X1550<br />
<br />
I am using the computer in question right now by plugging the monitor into the on board video card (Nvidia GeForce 6150) instead of the Radeon card.<br />
<br />
MONITOR TEST - monitor is fine; I tested it on another PC and am using it now.<br />
GRAPHICS CARD - I tried an alternative graphics card - still nothing.<br />
BATTERY - removed the motherboard battery and left it out for 10 mins - no change.<br />
<br />
It's as if the computer can no longer see the graphics card at all - it no longer shows up in hardware manager. Did a system restore to before the Windows update but that didn't change anything.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>One thing to note is that one of the optional Windows updates was the drivers for the&nbsp;on-board Nvidia&nbsp;&nbsp;GeForce 6150 LE - which is similar to the OP's situation.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I've found at least three other posts from people having a very similar issue so it's starting to look less and less like a coincidence. Another thing I've
 found is that none of the Windows updates actually worked - so I'm not totally convinced that the Windows update was the cause of the problem.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I'm now wondering if the PCI-E slot stopped working on it's own, causing the on-board card to kick in, which caused Windows to recognise it and find updated
 drivers - so the cause of Windows providing an update for the on-board adapter was the dead PCI-E slot - not the other way around. This makes more sense than a Windows update actually killing the slot.</span></div>

            But, could the PCI-E slot be unable to function but still powered? I.e. still spin the fan on a graphics card and still tell the monitor whether or not it's plugged in? Because at the moment this is the case for me. Fan on card spins, monitor knows when
 it's plugged/unplugged from the card - but absolutely no signal is getting out to wake up the monitor.

            I'm not sure if anyone is able to solve our situations. A couple weeks ago my PC installed several Windows updates upon shutting down. I have Windows 7 64bit installed. When the PC restarted my video outsource was a mess. I was able to see my desktop normally
 for a few minutes and then both my monitors went to solid yellow.<br />
<br />
I rebooted, the same thing happened so on the next reboot I immediately ran a system restore and...poof everything was fine.<br />
<br />
I updated my video card drivers with the latest off EVGA (geforce 9500 gt) and continued to use my pc as normal for several hours.<br />
<br />
However, I did not shut off the windows auto update and when I shut down..the exact same updates I rolled back installed again.<br />
<br />
Now my pci-e slots aren't functioning. I've tested two WORKING video cards in those slots..the fans power up, the PC powers up but there is no outsource to my monitors.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything you all have to get video out working again but to no avail. My motherboard does not have its own video source to attempt a bios update.<br />
<br />
So basically I'm stuck with a pc that no longer has video. My PC was fine before this update, I'm on it constantly, I never saw issues with this new card until this Windows update.<br />
<br />
Really not pleased that I have to purchase a new motherboard because of Windows.<br />
