<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Whenever you plug the system to battery you get two options in Power options and then under the battery mode you have options were you can select what you want to do
 when the laptop is on power save mode.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Copy paste re-orders my clips in movie maker 2011</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've just undertaken a bit of a music video project and thought movie maker would suffice. I'm using just photos (although many!) and an audio track, no video clips.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've put the photos in the project, numbered, say 1-15. I have then made a copy of this and reversed the order. So this plays 1-15 followed by 15-1. As this is repeated a lot of times in the clip I'm producing I want to be able to copy paste this whole
 segment in to another area of the video - however when I try to copy and paste this the reversed section re-orders itself, to mostly the original way round, and with some photos in a seemingly random order. &nbsp;e.g I get 1-15, then again 1-13, 15, 14.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I doing something wrong here? I've tried keyboard shortcuts, right clicks, and the buttons.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would be great if I could get a fix for this, save me re-arranging the second half every time I copy paste!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running Windows 7 pro 64 bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Paul.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have simulated your issue and I also encounter what you are experiencing. Windows Live Movie Maker automatically sorts the items based on their filename.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can try to create a copy of the pictures&nbsp;of the reversed part of your project, then have it imported to Live Movie Maker. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Create a new folder on your computer. This will be the location of reversed section of your project.</p>
<p>2. Copy the photos to the new folder. </p>
<p>3. Rename the copied photos in a way that they will be sorted alphabetically or numerically. (e.g. Photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg...). Start renaming with the last photo so it would be the first photo that will appear in Movie Maker.</p>
<p>4. On Windows Live Movie Maker, import the normal sequence of photos first.</p>
<p>5. Import the reversed sequence of the photos afterwards.</p>
<p>6. You can now copy the whole segment while retaining the sequence of the photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you need more assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm not seeing the issue when I copy/paste from Total Commander, a shareware file management app.... it I sort a folder of images one way and copy/paste it into WLMM, they go into the storyboard in that sequence. Then if I sort them differently in Total
 Commander and add them to the end of the storyboard, they go into it as sorted in the file manager, and don't rearrange the first set.</p>
<p>I'm dragging and dropping the sets of images into WLMM, not using the Add pix feature. It seems to work the same as what Litton suggests.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having a similar problem but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the name of the images. I am just copying some images and pasting (whether it be in the same working file or a new one) and they will always order incorrectly in the same pattern.
<br />
<br />
When I copy them and paste, IMG_1387.JPG will always go right after the first image (IMG_1353.JPG). This is just a small example so you get the idea of what is happening. It's like that any time I copy and paste. Photos or videos move around. There is no rhyme
 or reason to it it seems. This is really annoying since when a file gets too big, Movie Maker has a tendency to crash. This is why I work on smaller files and then copy and paste them together. I do not want to have to create the .wmv file and import because
 I tinker with the length of clips and the music. This is yet another annoyance of Movie Maker. Sure it's free, but it's sure frustrating to work with.<br />
<br />
So if it's not the file name, why is MM rearranging the order of any pasted clips?<br />

            Where they go when pasted depends on what point in the project you currently have selected. If you don't change the selection after each pasting, they'll go into the same spot.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It's not the point where they go in the project but rather the <i>order </i>
of the files after I paste them. If I copy five items and just paste them (basically what you said), they will appear right after the five originals but in the WRONG order. If I copy the five items and paste them at the end of the project or in a separate new
 project, they will also be in the WRONG order from the original five that I copied.
<br />
<br />
Interestingly, in all cases the pasted 'wrong' order will be the same wrong order for any paste in any location. Clearly, Movie Maker is ordering them in some way when they are copied so that when pasted, they are in a different order. Why though? Why is MM
 reordering items that are copied? No other program does that. I want them in the original order that I copied them. That is the point of copying and pasting!<br />
<br />
I did some tests and discovered that after pasting, .JPGs will appear before .MOVs. For example, if I am copying an image, a video, an image, and another video, the pasted order will be an image, another image, a video, and a second video. Clearly MM is indeed
 using the file type to reorder the items. Within the images, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as IMG_1387.JPG
<i>always</i> jumps before IMG_1354.JPG when pasting (even though they are in proper order when copied). This shuffling of items after copying and pasting is really frustrating and is preventing me from moving photos and videos between projects.<br />

            As I'm not seeing the issue in MM2012.... it might be related more to what you're copying from rather than what you're pasting to. What file manager are you doing the copying from?

            <p>Hi Eepruls,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to what PapaJohn is asking, I&nbsp;would like you to try the steps listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your Windows Movie Maker.</li><li>Click the <strong>Click here to browse for videos and photos.</strong></li><li>On the Video Library,&nbsp;select <strong>Name </strong>on the&nbsp;drop down menu beside "<em>Arrange by</em>:".</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the photos and videos are in the same folder, then it is best that you arrange then by
<strong>Type.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update us via this thread is the issue is still evident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            PapaJohn, what do you mean when you ask what File Manager am I doing the copying from? I'm copying items on my timeline. And Francis_S, there is no browse for videos and photos button but rather "Add Photos and Videos". But what does this have to do with
 items already on my timeline in the project? The photos and videos in my project have already been imported, ordered to my liking, music overlayed, animations and transitions included, etc. I'm copying some of these items (or even the whole lot) and pasting
 either within the project or in a brand new project. When doing so, some files reorder themselves. Not all, but some.<br />
<br />
PapaJohn, you said MM 2012. I'm still using Windows Live Movie Maker Version 2011 and was unaware of the upgrade. I will download the new version. Perhaps this was a bug that has been corrected!<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            So I downloaded MM2012 and it seems to have been fixed! Anything copied from the timeline and pasted is now pasted in the same order as it was copied. I can't tell you how happy this makes me because I work with many MM projects and copy and paste items
 on the timelines between them to keep the lengths manageable (long projects with many files tend to freeze up MM). Anyways, I didn't realize there was an upgraded version until this conversation so thank you to you both!<br />

    <title>Cortana live tile not working on any of my W10 devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana live tile not working on any of my W10 devices</h2>
                    <p>I have several W10 devices - Surface 3, HP tablet and a Lumia 640 Windows phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All have Cortana pinned to Start screen.&nbsp; On October 24, I noticed my Band 2 was no longer getting Cortana updates then noticed Cortana's live tile not working on all of my W10 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 10/24:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated my Surface 3 to FCU. Cortana live tile still not working.</p>
<p>Kept up with updates for both the HP tablet and L640.&nbsp; Cortana live tile still not working.</p>
<p>Tried the usual unpin - pin Cortana tile, changed its size, etc. to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana works otherwise, but no live tiles. This "feature" has always been a bit flaky. Even with newest updates it still is.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply but I wondered how this will fix my phone's Cortana live tile? I do know that in the past when Cortana's live tile went dormant, it would "wake up" without any action on my part on the phone.&nbsp; Now I paid attention to my other devices
 and noticed the live tile not working. And updating to FCU just the other day probably or should have started a fresh Cortana config on my Surface, but that's a SWAG on my part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll wait a bit then try your resetting procedure.&nbsp; Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

            After another week of no live Cortana Tiles on any of my devices, I decided to turn off all Cortana notebook interests.&nbsp; I'll wait a few days for the dust to settle to see if turning on a few interests "wakes up" Cortana's live tile. &nbsp;

<p>Yesterday (11/14/2017) was Patch Tuesday.&nbsp; There was an update for all my devices, including the Lumia 640.&nbsp; After the update was installed on the L640, Cortana's tile became animated (new behavior) but there were no updates in the tile, but her "eye" was
 not static as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes on my other devices - Surface and Stream 8 tablet.&nbsp; Cortana's eye remains static.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see what happens as time goes on but to my mind Cortana's live tile behavior needs some work from our friends at MSFT.</p>

            Cortana's live tile animation on my phone went dormant a few days ago after a few days being animated. No idea why. Tile wasn't flipping during this animation time and there was no text of any kind. Been that way since Oct. 24.&nbsp; Other Win10 devices are
 still Cortana tile quiet.<br />

            11/14 was a patch Tuesday that reset my 640.&nbsp; I'd call that a hard reset more or less.&nbsp; Gears spinning etc. Cortana tile animated after the reset for a few days then became dormant again.

<h2>            Sufrace Pro 4 Front Facing Camera Issue with Lighting</h2>
                    <p>When I am trying to make videos using my front facing camera, the darkness of the background changes as I move around (either my head moves or I gesture with my hands). It appears to be some auto function in the software that I cant figure out how to turn
 off and Its adding a layer of distraction to the videos I make. Is there a way to get rid of this autofunction?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Glenn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Surface Pro 4 camera automatically adjusts the brightness depending on the ambient light levels. We suggest that you set the ISO, Exposure and White Balance manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to turn off adaptive brightness. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Power options </strong>in the search box and click on <strong>Power Options.</strong><br />
</li><li>Open your active power plan, click <strong>Change plan settings</strong> to open
<strong>Edit Plan Settings</strong> window.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong> option. This will open the<strong> Power Options</strong> dialog.<br />
</li><li>Expand <strong>Display </strong>and then expand <strong>Enable adaptive brightness</strong>. Choose
<strong>Off </strong>for both<strong> On Battery </strong>and<strong> Plugged In.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the suggested steps. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why your pointing devices are not working as expected. One of which is if it there are outdated drivers. To isolate the issue, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Were there any changes made to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally that problem got solved, what happened is after installing windows 10 direct X got unistalled I guess so one day I tried to run one game to test whether it's hardware problem or not, when I clicked on game exe it said to install direct X so I installed
 after that the problem got solved.</p>
<p>So my problem was missing of direct X.&nbsp; After installing that everything got solved and performance improved.</p>

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all: 
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1903 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you will be using someone's computer, it is not advisable to access your email using Windows Live Mail. When you configure your account in Windows Live Mail, your emails will be viewed by anyone who's using the same computer unless there's another user account
 on that computer which is only accessible by you.<br />
<br />
I suggest that you login to your account using a browser</span>. <br />
<br />
Get back to us for any concerns.<br />

<h2>            microsoft authenticator</h2>
                    <p>I recently accidently downloaded Microsoft authenticator app while downloading iTunes on my windows computer. now I am locked out of iTunes. seems I never learn from my mistakes I took the bait again and bought a windows computer again. now 1/4 of my existence
 is tied up trying to fix or figure out how to use it.&nbsp; I can't use support because they only make it worse. its a helpless feeling being a windows customer. my email stopped working becaue of Hotmail updates. I'm locked out of ITunes because of the authenticator.
 get help from so called windows approved techs. theres nowhere to turn but start over and just start my life over with a new email and have apple remove the windows authenticator, if the even can I am beginning to think authenticator is a virus I locked me
 out on my iPhone also. I just don't know what to do anymore</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creator Wi-Fi Slow Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalealden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creator Wi-Fi Slow Down</h2>
                    <p>What is Microsoft doing to address the significant loss of Wi-Fi speed on pc's updated to Windows Creator? I, like many, was running the previous version of Windows 10 just fine and my Wi-Fi ran consistently at 55 - 65 Mbps. It now runs at 5 Mbps just like
 the old days when using dial up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is neither acknowledgement nor help posted on your website in this regard, yet the internet is lit up from affected users who are basically all claiming the same thing. Why is Microsoft dragging its heels in putting forth a solution. The speed issue
 is killing me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never even asked for this update, as you forced it upon me and then left me hanging in the breeze. I have 3 notebooks (non M$), a tablet with windows, and 1 Surface Book. The Surface Book is the only one that wasn't affect by this update, which leads me
 to believe that perhaps Microsoft is conspiring against other pc manufactures to gain an edge. . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's hoping you get off your collective keistas without further delay!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your Internet connection can refresh your connectivity. Let us see if the actual speed of your Internet returns and it will now be consistent after performing the process below. To start troubleshooting your concern with your WiFi, we suggest that
 you reset your TCP/IP or Internet Protocol to its default settings. To do this, follow the methods below:</p>

<p>Hello, and good day:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try method 1. Multiple times in the past and just now. No change in performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 did make some improvement. Wi-Fi speed did increase to 30 Mbps on my Windows Creator machine, but my iPhone connection from the very same location ran at 65 Mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out that this speed issue thing is exclusive to my Windows’ machines. Wi-Fi speeds for my Android devices and iPhone(s) run at maximum speeds (always). I truly believe this issue is limited to and caused by Windows Creator. Before the
 update I had no issues whatsoever with Wi-Fi speeds. In fact, I was really quite pleased with Wi-Fi connectivity in my home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to regain performance I rolled back Windows to the previous edition of Windows 10. The roll-back went well except it deleted certain critical Intel Drivers (unrelated) which I am now unable to get replacements. While my machine was idle Microsoft
 re-updated it to the Creator edition. I just can’t win. . . </p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the Intel files Microsoft rollback deleted: Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (v7.0.0.2023), Management Engine Components (v9.5.0.1428), Processor Graphics (v20.19.15.4549) , and SDK for OpenCL - CPU Only Runtime Package (v3.0.0.63463). Intel
 doesn’t have them and technical support for my machine (ASUS) basically told me to pound sand. Would Microsoft have them in their archives?</p>
<p>Looking for to your prompt reply. . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>CHEERS!</p>

<p>Hi Johann:</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect I would have to say that whoever put you up to that response must be losing their mind. I would have to be running a microwave 24/7 for it to have any impact (if indeed any at all) on my particular issue, and the rain theory absolutely
 blows my mind; however, I will now wear a tinfoil beanie while in the house to ward off Aliens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hi-speed cable network and, as previously stated, it has almost always performed flawlessly regardless if my cat is crying, the neighbors are talking too loudly, the house across the street is being painted or if my kid heated up a hot pocket in
 the microwave. Additionally, I also reported this problem is brand new since the Windows 10 Creator update, and if I directly connect to my modem via LAN (bypassing Wi-Fi) my internet speed runs at max speed on all Windows 10 Creator machines. Furthermore,
 my iPhone, Android tablets, and Android phones run at max speed on Wi-Fi. The only devices in my household that don't run well on Wi-Fi are those with Windows 10 Creator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate the fact that Microsoft takes the liberty of updating my machines without my knowledge and whenever they feel like it. I had purposely rolled back Creator to the previous Windows 10 on my test notebook, and Microsoft reinstalled Creator overnight
 while my machine was idle. It's like Microsoft broke into my house and had its way with my equipment while I tried to catch some zzzzzz's.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated at the outset of my initial contact, M$ needs to get off its keista and start taking this problem seriously. Just a cursory review of the web shows a large number of folks are affected by this and have been since Creator was rolled out. Good
 hearted readers are trying to provide answers, and M$ is doing absolutely nothing. I never asked for a free Windows, I just want a Windows that works each and every time I sit down to do some work. It's not like computers were invented yesterday!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the sense that I am upset, Johann, you are very astute. This brings me back to the old days when everyone in the world was wrong except for Microsoft. . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see the point of continuing this conversation because Microsoft has NOTHING and, unless 95% of your users start complaining, you never will. . .</p>

<p>I have tried all of the previous suggestions without success. To reiterate, my Wi-Fi speeds have dropped off big time after Microsoft Update updated my machine to Windows 10 Creator. Wi-Fi speeds now run in the range of 5 mbps to 30 mbps, but mostly on the
 lower end of that range. Before Creator, Wi-Fi ran consistently at 60 - 65 mbps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop now runs at the speed range listed above; however, from the very same location(s) my iPhone runs at 65 mbps and my wife's android phone runs at top speed too. Placement of my laptop does not affect Wi-Fi speed. These issues were not present prior
 to the Creator update when I was running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end. I feel Microsoft trashed my machine and I am getting next to nothing support, along with off-the-wall suggestions about microwaves and aliens! What has happened to Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back to Windows 10 and, when doing so, the rollback deleted many original files that accompanied my machine. I described this problem in an earlier reply that is part of this thread. Afterward, Microsoft update re-installed the Creator version!
 Damn!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be so pleased with my laptop, now I just want to slam it against a wall thanks to Microsoft.

</p><p>That was very well said. I have delayed, paused and turned off the updates numerous times. &nbsp;It still continues to do it. I am so frustrated and have wasted so much time trying to remedy this. &nbsp;I am not understanding why they do not have actual standalone
 MS stores so we can actually see someone face to face and not go on these famous MS sup port link goose chases. It's their product, &nbsp;it's their place to fix it not ours. Apple has stores to take their products to, why don't they. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Found this thread and felt I should post - my son has a new laptop (PC), and I have an apple MacBook Air.&nbsp; We also have various other devices such as ipads, iphones in the home. We are in Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have wifi, including a 5G service. Before we had the PC, we were exclusively an Apple device home and would connect to the 5G service and get wifi speeds of around 100mbps (between 80 - 100).&nbsp; We were very happy with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son got the PC gaming computer because he felt he could access more games etc on a PC. Initially it seemed to work fine.&nbsp; However lately, eventhough he is connecting to the 5G wifi, the speed is slow (between 1 - 5 mbps)!&nbsp; We have tested his pc alongside
 my apple laptop/iphone (at the same time, same place) and his is the only device that gets the slow speed while everything else runs at the usual rate of 80 - 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have now been trying various solves via the internet (including the ones listed above) but don't get beyond 5mbps.&nbsp; It is extremely frustrating and not sure what we can do??&nbsp; I am regretting getting the PC because at least with my apple devices I can
 at least get online support or failing that go into the apple store and have a tech look at the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at MS let me know how I can get some support from a person to talk me through a fix for this PC laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation.</p>

            Hi, I seem to have a very similar problem right now. Maybe it occurred earlier and I just never really noticed it, but it seems like it just popped up in the last month or so after Windows 10 updates. Anyway, for my iphone and ipad, I get around 50 Mbps
 down/up speeds as measured through an online speed test. My Surface Pro 4 however seems to get in this mode where the down speed drops drastically to 5 Mbps. What I have found is that if I disconnect and reconnect to the WiFi router it jumps back up to 40-50
 Mbps for down/up speed. This unexplained drop in speed is happening every day. It doesn't matter whether I'm doing a resume from sleep or a cold reboot.&nbsp; I'm glad I found some workaround but it is very annoying to have my fastest device in the home performing
 worse intermittently than my other devices.

<p>Here goes some update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Opera, works fine. This post is made with Opera.</p>
<p>Comodo IceDragon, Fireworks alternative, works but seems not stable. Crashed once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comodo Dragon, Chrome alternative, didn't work, same as Chrome, starts and closes immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When disconnect network, Chrome stays. The moment the network connection is made, Chrome closes, no error. Comodo Dragon won't stay open even with network disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge seems to work, but very slow.</p>

<p>I solved this problem like this (if you using Comodo Security software):<br />
<br />
1. Open Comodo Advanced Settings &gt; Advanced Protection &gt; Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>2. Click&nbsp; "Exclusions" (beside of the 'Detect shellcode injections' text).</p>
<p>3. Click Add &gt; Files &gt; browse and select "firefox.exe, iexplore.exe, chrome.exe" (if under the which folder them).</p>
<p>4. Click "Ok &gt; Ok".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try again your browsers, it works on my computer.</p>
<p>My best regards...</p>

            Comodo published an update today. If update your versions to 10.0.1.628, don't need any adjust. Everything works fine.

<h2>            Windows 7 0xc0000142 error message when starting up</h2>
                    Whenever i start up my laptop i get an error message saying "csc.exe application error, The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142). When i try to run the command prompt i get the same message even if i try to run it in safe mode. When i
 try install windows 7 service pack one i get even more pop ups. One from makecab.exe and bcdedit.exe then the updates fail. I've tried system restore but that didnt help. Can someone please help me with my problems? I'm not really sure how long i've been having
 this problem.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the below methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the system file checker and see if it helps.</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Try performing an inplace upgrade and check if it helps.</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>

            I'm unable to do the system file checker since i'm unable to run the command prompt at all neither as administrator nor even in safe mode. When i bought the laptop i wasnt given any software disk therefore i'm unable to do an inplace upgrade. I've run
 the virus scan and it has come up clean. The last thing i remember doing on the laptop before it started to give me those error messages was windows updates. I have a Toshiba A505-s6005 laptop

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the error occur in safe mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error does not occur in safe mode, then try performing clean boot on the computer and check if it helps.</p>

            Are you mainly having problems when you are typing on the keyboard and your wrist accidentally sets off the touchpad?&nbsp; If so, there is a freeware program called "touchfreeze" which will disable your touchpad while you are typing.&nbsp; When you stop typing
 the pad will re-activate.<br />

<h2>            Reading Mac files on external hard drive via Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saving the drama of switching from Mac to Windows (sigh), I've decided on purchasing the Surface Pro 4... what I need to know if there is a safe program that exists to install on a&nbsp;Surface Pro 4 (Windows 10) that will allow it to read the Mac Time
 Machine backups file on my external hard drive so I can extract my iTunes content and save onto the Surface Pro 4. I don't have a Mac Book available (logic board kaputz) so I am looking for a viable option to do this without the use of a Mac. Thanks in advance!</p>

How can i transfer my files from mac to PC? I borrowed my girlfriend's

 TB of Fat32!! So it was well worth the wait... just leave it running until it is done. I have transferred all my music, pics, etc to my external drive from the mac and i was able to access and USE those same files on my girl's PC (which is Windows 8 btw) .....
 In summary: I was never ab;e to get the PC to read from a Mac format HFS drive. I needed both the Mac and a PC to get the job done. Just get a hard drive formatted as FAT32 and you ca

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Have not tried it yet, but description says it can read only (the files in you Mac formatted external hard drive).</p>
<p>This way, although not being able to edit or write, you can at least copy the files to Windows.</p>

<div>ok. what happened is my friend sent ne a .exe file over skype. he clicked the wrong fike. it shoukd have been a .zip file. he said to open it in winrar, so i right clicked and clicked open with. i then clicked WinRAR. The 'set as default program' option
 was greyed out and had no tick, so I persumed it wasnt going to set winrar to open .exe by default. but it did. i cant open any othe .exe program now which is a HUGE inconvinience. I did this off my phone. i think its just my user account. But it is a family
 PC. I dont know what to do. If someone could find the file that opens .exe files that would be great, or any other solution.</div>

<h2>            When booting, get Reference_by_Pointer blue screen</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I have Windows 10 Pro 64bit, RAM 8 GB in a new desktop by Dell.<br />
</p>
<p>After 3 weeks I am getting a Reference_by_Pointer blue screen when booting.&nbsp; So I can't load the Windows.&nbsp; How this issue could be fixed ??&nbsp; The Dell's in-built Check &amp; Fix for Windows 10 doesn't find anything and says all is fine with Windows.<br />
<br />
Also, please tell me how to enter the Safe Mode when booting with Windows 10, as I can't load Windows and set the Safe Mode in the settings there or by msconfig.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

            Hi newu_873
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are not able to login to - Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
