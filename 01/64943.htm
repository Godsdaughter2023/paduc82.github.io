<h2>            Sticky Keys..Permanently Disable Them - Does anyone know how&#63;</h2>
                    I somehow activated the Sticky Keys and my page scrolls up and down and zooms in and out when I try to do anything.&nbsp; I can disable the Sticky Keys TEMPORARILY by pressing Shift 5 times and my computer works fine for about 30 seconds and then it reverts
 back. So, I am absolutely sure this is the problem. (I DID A COMPLETE VIRUS SCAN) I would like to know HOW to disable this feature permanently, or at least disable the feature that I accidentally hit. PPPPLLLEEZZEE HELP!!...NO LOL...thanks!!<br />

            It only works for about 20 seconds and then it reverts back to scrolling, zooming, certain images on the screen are blurry. I does work when I press down the shift key 5 times. That is how I know that is what is wrong but it doesn't stay that way. It's
 as if something I do on the key board triggers it back on. I am sure of this because it isn't always 20 seconds. Time varies so I believe it is a common key that I use.I have tried everything I can think of. Sometimes it seems to last longer when I press down
 on the SPACE KEY + SHIFT KEY 5 TIMES.

<p>Once sticky keys is turned off, it shouldn't turn itself back on unless there's a group policy or some unknown program forcing it. Is this a company PC by chance?</p>

<p>try opening the task manager&gt;on the lower left click more details&gt;click the startup tab and disable everything in there&gt;restart the computer and see if issue persists. If issue is no longer present, go back into the task manger and enable the items one at
 a time restarting the PC each time until the issue returns. That will tell you exactly what program is having a start up issue.</p>

            can you pull the application log from the event viewer? You will need to know the exact date and time you restart the pc so you get the correct log file, you will want to filter for errors (this will making finding the log file much easier).

<p>So far I have not been able to resolve the problem with the error message. I have tried&nbsp;but to no success.
</p>
<p>It does not seem to affect anything, it is just annoying. I think it is a compatibility issue. I just haven't figured out which app is no longer working. I am going to try opening each app on the computer to see if there is a problem with any of them not
 opening or if I get some type of message when trying to open. </p>
<p>Thanks for the follow up.</p>

            Yes, right.
<br />But before you delete Hotmail account, check that you can connect with the new account

<h3> corkyblackney  say:</h3>
<h2>            LH-20A1S DVDRW Drive Vanishes on Restart&#47;Reboot</h2>
                    <p>Dowloaded, Burned ISO and Installed Windows 8 Pro (64 bit).<br />
LH-20A1S DVDRW Drive was used for the installation, Drive vanishes after 1st restart/reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observations;</p>
<p>At Post DVD Drive lamp comes on with check.<br />
Just prior to Win 8 "Splash" DVD Drive lamp comes on same as check.<br />
Registry shows entries for LH-20A1S DVD Drive.<br />
Device Manager drive is missing until "Show Hidden devices" is selected, then Device Mgr shows "LITE-ON DVDRW LH-20A1S ATA DEVICE".<br />
Check of "Properties" shows;<br />
"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)"<br />
Drive drawer opens and closes, lamps indicates drive is active and working.<br />
Hard Drive indicator lamp is ON constantly while computer is on, did NOT do this with other OS's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drive has worked fine for two years without problems in/on Win XP.&nbsp; Reads/Writes just fine.&nbsp; Worked to install Windows 8.</p>
<p>Searches of the web indicate that THIS drive problem has been reported with XP/Vista/Windows 7 64 bit versions.</p>
<p>System has 3 SATA Hard Drives installed and working, DVDRW Drive is Drive 1 (0,2,3 are the HDDs).</p>
<p>All Web results have been tried from the "FixIt" to Registry entries, NO drivers are available for this drive only a "Firmware" update and it was applied.</p>
<p>Manufacturer is Lite-On or Liteon, web site us.liteonit.com</p>
<p>I suspect it actually IS a registry entry change for Windows 8 to use the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone found a resolution for this problem?</p>

            <p>Thanx for the suggestions!&nbsp; Seen them before, they did NOT work, appreciate the input though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resolution found.<br />
</p>
<p>Removing or Disconnecting the DVDRW Drive SATA Cable and booting results in the HDD lamp blinking/flickering as normal (Read/Write indications).<br />
Reconnecting the DVDRW Drive results in original indications, HDD lamp stays on, Drive NOT found.<br />
Replacing SATA Cable, no change in conditions.&nbsp; Changed position of SATA Cable from Drive 2 to Drive 4, results in drive found, HDD lamps flickers during read/write process.<br />
Inserting CD results in "Autorun" of CD.<br />
System Shutdown, Cold Start.<br />
DVDRW Drive appears as normally.</p>
<p>After repeated cold starts, drive appears to be present and stable.<br />
</p>
<p>Appears that 64 bit OS wants to read all SATA HDDs in sequence, then Removable Drives.<br />
Rebooting/Restarting System to confirms results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data leading to resolution;<br />
Searched for resolution for problem with Drive or OS, problem found, no resolution posted.<br />
Searched for resolution for problem with Drive light constant ON, found reports of USB cables &amp; connectors bad (or other cable devices).&nbsp; Resolution was to replace cable.&nbsp; In this instance, the cable appeared good for all except Win 8 Pro 64.&nbsp; Hardware/OS Compatibility
 &nbsp;Issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did NOT find ANY notes about maintaining a sequence of HDDs with SATA, Can only assume this applies to 64 bit OS.</p>

    <title>Error 1079&#58; Windows could not start the Security Center service on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xtian f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1079&#58; Windows could not start the Security Center service on Local Computer</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Security Center can't be started in Services</p>
<p>My windows security center can't be started. I have gone to the Microsoft Management Console and tried to start the security center through Services but when I do I get the following message:</p>
<p>One or more ActiveX controls could not be displayed because either:</p>
<p>1) your current security settings prohibit running ActiveX controls on this page, or</p>
<p>2)you have blocked a publisher of one of the controls</p>
<p>As a result the page might not display correctly.</p>
<p>When I click "ok" on the message it just displays a blank page for the Services extended tab. When I click on the standard tab I can access security center and set the startup type to automatic but when I try and start the service I get the following error
 message:</p>
Windows could not start the Security Center service on Local Computer.
<p>Error 1079:The account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process.</p>
<p>I think the initial security center problem started from some malware/trojan issues. I have run malwarebytes, Spybot search and destroy and Avast. I have found several malware/trojans and deleted them but I am still having the same problem. Any thoughts?
 Your help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

Hi Xtian F,</p>
<p>This issue can occur if the Security Center service is not configured to run under the Local Service account but the dependent services are configured to run under the Local Service account.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, make sure the Security Center Service and all its dependencies are configured to run under the Local Service account. Try these steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Set the security center and its dependencies services to run under Local Service account.<br />
a. Click Start, type services.msc and hit enter.<br />
b. Double click on Security Center, click Log On tab.<br />
c. Select "This account" click Browse button, type Local Service and click ok.<br />
d. Type the password and confirm the password and click ok.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Perform the same steps for Windows Management Instrumentation service.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run online virus scan<br />
a. Visit <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</a><br />
b. Click Full Service Scan and complete the scan.<br />
c. Check the difference.</p>

            Hi Roshillag.<br /><br />What are the different types of Skype subscriptions and pay-as-you-go options?<br /><br />Subscriptions * are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited, or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). A subscription is great if you make a lot of calls. All subscriptions are renewed automatically, offer a savings compared to our standard rates, and you can cancel at any time. <br /><br />Skype Credit * is a pay-as-you-go option. Purchase some Skype Credit, and then call whoever you want at very low rates. Skype Credit is a good option if you need to make a few calls and only want to pay for what you use.<br /><br />A Skype Number is a phone number that you pay monthly for. People can call you from their mobile or landline and you pick the call up in Skype. A Skype Number is great option if you, or your friends and family live in different countries, or plan to travel abroad and want an affordable way to keep in touch.<br /><br />Skype to Go is a p

<h2>            My skype name is insane &#40;a bunch of just random numbers&#41;, and won&#39;t let me change it</h2>
                    I need my skype name to be able to set something up, and the only thing that shows up is my phone number. When I look on my app, it shows up as a random outlook email address with numbers and letters. I tried looking at help to figure out how to change
 it, but it isn't working.

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>An account's Skype Name is unchangeable. When Skype accounts were migrated to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, the option to create a custom Skype Name is also no longer available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype username shows as<strong> live:randomlettersandnumbers </strong>
then most probably, you created your account using your phone number. What I can suggest as a workaround is to either change your display name or create another account using an email address. Account that are created using an email address will have a Skype
 username show as&nbsp;<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows Store App Chosen to Download But Continuous Loading</h2>
                    So there I was on a mission, a quest for a working star chart or sky map app, which has lead me all the way to here, where I'm now posting a question which is more like a complaint in hopes that one would come along and solve the issue of complaint. After
 viewing numerous questions asked, I seen that for some it was a result in a bad windows 8.1 installation, others involving error codes. My case is slightly different however, The store loads, I can search some apps, oh but here's where it gets nasty with me,
 I click on an app and see the screen which I'll attach hereafter. The image is the screen I get directly after clicking to check out an app for download. Which to this second is still spinning round and round, when it will stop, only God knows. &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c6d7c4d-85f3-4674-b14d-7b7ac09bf49a" />

            <p><span>Hi Maranatha,<br />
<br />
1.What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2.Which security software is installed on the computer?<br />
3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1: Reset store cache.<br />
</b><br />
a. Press the Windows key + R<br />
b. Type: WSReset.exe and click ok.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2: </b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store?<br />

<br />
<b>Method 3: </b>Disable the security software temporarily and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you
 do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

            <p>Hello Jacqueline,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact error code you get?</p>
<p>2. Are you using the proxy settings to connect to the Internet?</p>
<p>3. Which anti-virus software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Do you able to install windows updates on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes this kind of unexpected behavior shown by Windows due to some missing or corrupt important system files. I would suggest you to rum Microsoft Safety Scanner SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix system file corruption (if any).</p>
<p>The sfc /scannow (System File Checker) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</p>

<p>Set Screen Resolution to Minimum of 1024 (width) x 768 (height)</p>
<p>The Store and apps require a minimum screen resolution of 1024 x 768 to work.</p>
<p>

<p>Try to update the drivers for display adaptor from manufacturer website.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x2efd in XMLHttpRequests crashes Hosted Web UWP App</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a crashing UWP App, that crashes when used Offline. It is a simple Web Hosted App that uses a remote StartPage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When starting offline the page loads from appcache, but then stops because of an exception in wwahost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Version is 1607 - 14393.693</p>
<p>UWP App - Target Version is&nbsp;10.0.14393.0</p>
<p>Visual Studio 14.0.25431.01 Update 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I further investigated the problem and found out that it is related to XMLHttpRequests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the&nbsp;XMLHttpRequests fails the App crashes. The Javascript console shows the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SCRIPT7002: XMLHttpRequest: Netzwerkfehler 0x2efd, Der Vorgang konnte aufgrund des folgenden Fehlers nicht fortgesetzt werden: 00002efd.<br />
</p>
<p>If i handle the error in the onerror callback of the XMLHTTPRequest my code gets called after the above error and the App still crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i override the open call of the&nbsp;XMLHttpRequest not doing the request everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the Webview crashing if a XHR request is not possible and what can i doc to prevent this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>

            <p>I don't have a solution for the touch pointer... yet. But for the finger touch flicks I do :)</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong> touch flicks on Win8 are gone :(<br />
Windows 8 can perform only pen flicks, and I don’t think this is going to change. The decision to remove finger touch flicks is utterly stupid and must have been made by someone who never used them on Windows 7. Since we are only a small number of users (who
 used the touch features on Windows 7) most Windows 8 users will not even know what they are missing.</p>
<p><br />
I tried many things to solve the issue (registry edits, replacing files from Win7) and none of them worked. But I don’t give up easily, so after hours of searching online I found this free app:<br />
<a href="http://www.strokesplus.com/files/StrokesPlus_2.3.8_x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.strokesplus.com/files/StrokesPlus_2.3.8_x64.zip</a></p>

Currently, the website is down returning (500 - Internal server error), but the download link is working (if not, you can use my link). This app is made for adding gestures to mouse, and it works like a charm with Win8 and touch screens. You can make and draw
 as much gestures as you wish, and assign the appropriate actions for them. It’s flexible, small, and extremely functional.</p>
<p><br />
The <strong>downside</strong> is that gestures should be made with a mouse right-click, then draw. This requires a bit extra time waiting for the press-and-hold to activate the right click, in contrast to the Win7 fast flicks. So you better change your press-and-hold
 settings to the shortest time possible:<br />
Control Panel\Pen and Touch\Press and hold settings<br />
And slide the “Speed” slider to the left.</p>
<p>However, there’s an<strong> upside</strong> to this app over the traditional flicks, that it’s not limited to only 8 flicks. You can make as much as you want adding great functionality.</p>
<p><br />
After spending some time with the app, I configured it to perform similar flicks to Win7 (backward, forward, copy, paste, etc.) and added 8 more gestures (I didn't like much the preinstalled gestures). Also, more importantly, I changed the settings to suit
 touch screens best and to avoid interfering with the touchpad. On my laptop, the result is great. To save you some time I uploaded my file. You just download and extract the files, and then try my customized settings. I also added instructions for making the
 program <strong>auto-start</strong> with Windows with <strong>administrative privileges</strong>. My file with the customized settings:<br />

</blockquote>
<p><br />
No.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I miss it too.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I have found something related that I haven't tried applying&nbsp; to Touch yet:&nbsp;&nbsp; I set one of my mouse buttons to&nbsp; Magnify.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that I could use touch where it would be otherwise impractical to but because the Magnifier
 was started with the mouse which I could use to click with just as easily as I might otherwise "tap" on the larger items, what would be the point?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, this reminds me that&nbsp; N-trig in its Multi-touch gestures does have a Magnifier gesture.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess this is the idea behind that?&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn't realized how useful that might be because I always relied on the Touch pointer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OMG.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could do it!&nbsp;&nbsp; The W8 Magnifier (in Loupe mode) grows some shaded drag lugs as soon as I use Touch on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So provided we had a way of toggling the Magnifier on and off we could drag the Loupe over an area which would otherwise be difficult to
 access with Touch and then tap an enlarged item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a worst case we could enable that feature with the On-Screen Keyboard, tapping&nbsp; Win-+&nbsp; and disable it with&nbsp; Win-Esc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for making me find this!</p>

            <p>Regarding the touch pointer, you can get back it if you’re willing to lose the visual feedback of the touch… stupid? Yea, that’s Microsoft’s way of making touch friendly OS :\</p>
<p><br />
Go to: Control Panel\Pen and Touch\Touch<br />
And uncheck “Show visual feedback when touching the screen”</p>
<p><br />
Then you will have your pointer back, but it’s not as useful as it was on Win7 because it disappears immediately after removing your finger of the screen.</p>

            <p>Robert, regarding using magnifier, that won’t work for me… but I think I have something good for you.<br />
While I was trying to solve the touch problem in Win8 I tried installing touch drivers and applications of other brands (Dell, Acer, Samsung…) and the “TouchSupport” for Samsung Slate seemed promising for its ability to perform gestures… unfortunately, it didn’t
 work and it required a Samsung device to run… however, when I accessed its files I saw a small and simple application called “TouchMagnifier” and it worked without a problem. This app behaves more like a traditional magnifier… it’s a piece of glass that you
 can resize and drag anywhere on the screen, and you can click <strong>through</strong> it… is this what you’re looking for?<br />
I extracted and uploaded it for you, it’s only 1mb:<br />
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/XJHdcK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/XJHdcK</a><br />
Check it out and let me know if it’s a good found<br />

That's exactly what I get with the W8 Magnifier in Loupe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the default mode of the Magnifier is&nbsp; Fullscreen mode which is not as useful for this purpose, especially for Metro mode apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you don't already have it in that mode, turn on
 the Magnifier, e.g. press Win-+ and then press Ctrl-Alt-L.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Apparently the "View" I use is called "Lens".&nbsp;&nbsp; I will still use Loupe for its better mnemonic value with the L.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I think of the Fullscreen mode as being a Fullscreen "lens"&nbsp;so its F doesn't
 stick with me as well for some reason (though I have probably reinforced it now &lt;w&gt;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the only additional benefit that having a separate program to do this with would be to facilitate getting it started, e.g. you could presumably&nbsp; pin it in various ways then that we couldn't&nbsp;do for&nbsp;a keyboard shortcut (or macro).<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>I may still try your program though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p><br />

            <div>Microsoft are a pain, aren't they? They always seem to remove some of the&nbsp;most&nbsp;useful features of their previous operating system for their new ones; they took some really nice features out of Vista when the were building 7, which made the file management
 system for one thing very&nbsp;laborious&nbsp;in 7 (at least for me anyway, and I don't think I was alone), and they've just done it again from 7 to 8. I wonder what will disappear from Windows 8 for Windows 9?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, that definitely is a decent app that you found! Unfortunately I don't have a touch screen that's properly compatible with 8 at the moment (the company is in the process of making new drivers and I've also pre-ordered a LEAP, but both are probably
 a couple of months off), but I've downloaded and installed the app anyway. I've been trying it with my mouse in both desktop and Windows 8 mode in the Windows 8 Enterprise evaluation I've currently got installed. I've decided to set it to the left mouse button
 instead for the moment. I have noticed however, the only gesture that seems to work in Windows 8 mode at the moment is the C to close one. Unfortunately you don't get the trail in Windows 8 mode so you can't really tell if it's working properly. I like the
 training mode that it has and how you can show it different ways of doing the same gestures, although I think I'll miss the confirmation symbol that appeared when you completed the gesture properly with the Windows flicks system. (It's going to take a while
 to completely test it though as it has&nbsp;</div>
<div>many options - including ones that you can code yourself which I might have a go at whenever I get some free time - although it doesn't look like you would be able to get it to come up with a&nbsp;confirmation&nbsp;symbol of any sort for any gesture.) I've also
 used resource hacker to do some finishing touches to it and have replaced the icons that it uses with icons from the Windows flicks system from Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have done a bit of extra searching however and have come up with a program called Flicks² -http://goo.gl/2cQiS - which is meant to 'extend' - although it looks like it acts as a full replacement for - the standard Windows 7 and Vista flicks by adding
 in two fingered flicks. The program seems to open and run properly in 8 without causing any errors, but I can't test it as I don't have a fully compatible touch screen. Have you tried this one yet?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately though, I can't test your way of getting the touch pointer on Windows 8 yet, due to the incompatible touch screen drivers; but I will assume that it will work, so thanks for that too.</div>

<p><br />
It is still there but not as useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Metro mode it is automatic but in Desktop mode you have to activate it manually and minimize it each time you use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also it does not have as useful a set of editing keys so you can end up switching from Tip to (full)
 Touch Keyboard to work around those deficiencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it may be just as effective to just use the full Touch Keyboard, although I switch to DSK instead of QWERTY because it feels so moronic doing hunt and peck with a stylus on QWERTY.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW you have to
 configure the full Touch Keyboard; by default it is off but once you let it show in the Taskbar it is almost more convenient IMO than the hidden Tip tray is in W7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; I just noticed in W7 I can have an icon for the Tip in the&nbsp;Taskbar too.&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp;&nbsp;So
 there goes W8's advantage for that one too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

<p>Hi Kishore,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We won't be able to provide you with the product key as Windows 10 has a digital license, instead of a 25-character product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also like to clarify that if Windows 10 was preinstalled on your PC, the manufacturer should be able to provide you with the recovery/installation media, so long as, your PC is still under their warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One option for you is to download the Media Creation Tool (MCT.exe) to create an installation media. If you have access to another PC, kindly go to our
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Software Download</a></strong> site, download the tool, and refer to
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media</strong> in the same page for steps on how to create the media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use the media to try and boot the PC. This will allow you to repair the PC, or reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>You can't find it, if it isn't there.</p>
<p>Neither Windows 7, nor any other version of Windows, has ever included<br />
Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Access, or any other significant application<br />
software. Such programs have to be bought, either by themselves or as<br />
part of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>If your previous computer, running an older version of Windows, came<br />
with Word, it was because the vendor who sold it bundled it as part of<br />
the package he sold you, not because that version of Windows came with<br />
it. Some, but not all, vendors do the same with Windows 7 computers (but if they do, it is very likely just a trial version).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sorry? What Windows XP disk? Do you mean Office XP? If so, that's at<br />
least partly correct. It is not completely compatible with Windows 7.<br />
You may be able to use it, but some things won't work, or won't work<br />
correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to take tables, etc. in documents.&nbsp; I have something on my computer that says&nbsp; OpenOffice but it doesn't seem to have 'word'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenOffice is a free Office suite that is pretty similar to Microsoft<br />
Office (which is far from free).&nbsp; You won't find Word there, but you<br />
can try using its word processor, which be very much like Word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now my wastebasket tells me it is corrupted!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I don't understand that. Please clarify what you mean, and<br />
provide the exact verbatim text of any error messages.</p>

            <p>Hi Craigos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand you are trying to get the font back to normal size in Windows Live mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you hold down Ctrl key and + when you are in Windows live mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to open Windows Live mail and hold down Ctrl and + key from keyboard&nbsp;and check what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also hold down Ctrl key and Scroll mouse wheel to increase or decrease the font size.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need any assistance, we will be glad to help you.</p>

    <title>windows 10 update 1803 has crashed my pc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen8458  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 update 1803 has crashed my pc</h2>
                    <p>so yesterday evening the latest windows 10 update was installed just as i shut down.
</p>
<p>I choose the install and shutdown option as I was done for the day. This morning it would not boot up. I get a blue screen asking me to choose a keyboard. It then presents me with options to 'continue to windows 10' / use a device / trouble shoot / turn
 off your pc. If I select continue the oc attempts to restart but comes back to the same blue screen asking for a keyboard. and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>I contacted the online support who were unable to help as it was/is a no-boot issue. They gave me a phone number to call but that was for a 'paid service' only. WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR SOMETHING MICROSOFT HAS DONE TO MY PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if I choose 'troubleshoot' I get 3 options, refresh your pc / reset your pc / advanced.</p>
<p>Refresh, comes back with 'there was a problem with refreshing your pc, no changes were made.</p>
<p>Reset, comes back with 'unable to reset your pc. A required drive partition is missing.</p>
<p>which leaves ADVANCED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advanced there is a 'command prompt' option, if I select that it takes me to a command window where it displays 'x' drive. I can see all my system files using DOS commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my question:</p>
<p>How can I recover my partition, I have software installed that I can not re-install WITHOUT releasing the license first (yes I know, not helpful if your system crashes like mine has)</p>
<p>

<p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; I can see that my files are still there through the directory but I cannot get it to recover.&nbsp; I tried opening a previous session but now I don't have a profile and access to my files. How do I get around this?</p>

<p><span>Hi Stephen,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the partition are you talking about that you want to recover? Can you give us more details or complete question?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Usually, after updating <strong>Windows 10</strong>, your computer usually requires your operating system to be restored into a basic state by performing a clean boot. You can visit this link:
<strong><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></span></strong> for instructions. In some cases, this operation
 must be done to make your system adapt for its new environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can watch this video to know how to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:

<p>Johann,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the exact same symptoms as the original poster. The problem is that Windows does not even start. The blue screen is present all the time. No matter which option I choose the PC does a restart and you have to start all over again. I am in an eternal
 loop and can do nothing. So a Clean Boot is not possible.</p>

<p>Quick update:</p>
<p>I took the computer to a local pc repair shop. They checked it out and reported that the bios had become corrupt during the update/re-boot and hence the system would not boot. They then reconfigured the bios and the pc now boots normally (i have yet to try
 this myself, but see no reason to doubt them). The system has also been updated to 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I could see all the files and folders on the drive, but being displayed as 'X' dive.</p>

<p>Let me add a liitle more background info, sorry if i should of given this at the start.</p>
<p>Pc has multiple HDs. One is mounted direct on motherboard, 60GB. Then there is a 2Tb 'data' drive and finally a a new 275GB SSD was installed 6 months back to replace the smaller 60GB (which was basically full). Due to access the 60Gb was left installed
 and the bios set to boot from the new 275GB drive. During the final reboot after the attempted upgrade the bios became corrupt and hence with multiple drives with operating systems on the system did not know which one to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The repair shop have removed the smaller 60Gb drive, the data drive had already been removed so the business could function. So currently there is only one drive in the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others.</p>

<p>Hi Stephen8458 - I had the exact same issue as you have explained mine&nbsp;occurred on Sunday after a let it update before going to sleep (big mistake) The next morning I woke to the exact same screen you are talking about the keyboard Screen. I thought I was
 screwed I didn't know what to do Just Like you. <br />
After hours messing about with it going mad and watching a ton of You tube videos then messing about with the Command prompt from watching this video, (this lad seems to know what he was doing) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzjXS9oLjQ , after doing that
 I restarted my pc I was some how able to get it back to my Log In screen, don't even ask my how I think I chose the windows home option in choose a option. That's not even the end of it though when I signed in it took a good 2 minutes then I was met with the,
 "We've got some updates for you message" so I waited and nothing, Then all of a sudden I was met with a Black screen with only The recycle bin. The start button didn't work basically nothing worked and all my Icons and desktop folders where not there.
<br />
</p>
<p>So Then I brought up the task manager "Ctrl Alt Delete" and hit the power Icon RESART. After that the same thing happened, This time though after the long log in again, I was met with a Blue windows screen and a Error on the screen saying "Sihost.exe Unknown
 Hard error", but this time I could see my desktop Icons and some of my folders on the desktop and I was able to open the libraries through them to Copy and paste my Important files off the pc. But make sure you don't click on the error Icon as it will just
 turn you pc screen black again. Start button and settings still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after I copied my files onto a Hard drive, I thought stuff this I will just reinstall it from the Bootable USB found here https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10 . You'll need to do this on another laptop or pc though, Just download
 the tool now, then open it chose the USB option then follow the prompts it will put the setup files on the USB need about 8gb. Once that has been download I went back to the Pc with the blue desktop clicked on the folder to get to the libraries went to that
 USB I created and double clicked on the installer icon. Followed the prompts chose to keep all my files and hit install and it stared to Install again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was still sceptical it was going to work but to my surprise it installed fine (just got to leave it to do it's thing) and Boom I had my Pc back and my Internet and all my programs and files where still there. Thank god for that I said. The funny thing
 is I called Microsoft and they said my computer was too Old (2009 dell Inspiron I.3 4gbR 500gbHD) there's nothing wrong with I said it's your stupid bloody updates wrecking peoples PC's! This really was a disaster it took me 3 days to work it out and get my
 PC back to normal, bit of a disgrace the whole thing. Twice this has happened to me in the space of 2 months now. I'm never Updating again and the first thing I did was go to service centre and disable Stupid Windows Updates! Microsoft really needs to sort
 this out it's a big issue.<br />
Anyway Hope this helps so You can get your PC back working normal like it should be. All The Best.</p>

<p>Hi Phillip_NSNO.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your post and for getting me out of a hole. I followed the YouTube vid and rebuilt the MBR. It still left me with a blue screen but I had the extra ability to reset the PC. I have completed the reset and now have a working PC. Unfortunately
 I have lost all my installed programs and have had to go back to square one. I have a lot of photography software and will take a lot of days to get back to where I was but at least I can work. I have blocked the 1803 update (naturally).</p>
<p>The silence from Microsoft was expected. I have already lost 1 PC which had its BIOS bricked when I updated to Win 10 so I knew what to expect.</p>
<p>Thanks once again, much appreciated.</p>
<p>Alastair</p>

<p>But the problems came up just a few days&nbsp;(2 days exacly)&nbsp;after I ugraded W10 and installed some updates.<br />
As u can see, I got 4G Ram, when I just&nbsp;start&nbsp;pc, &nbsp;she already&nbsp;took 80% ram, just start Window.</p>
<p>And I read some advices about scan viruts, scan system with code like sfc/scannow, turn off&nbsp;window notifications...<br />
But after I did, now it goes up to &gt;90% Ram.<br />

<h2>            Deleting Windows10portal.com</h2>
                    <p>Since the most recent WIN10 update, I am bombarded with warnings of viruses, etc, as a 'pop up' whilst using Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; I did not ask for this service, and, indeed, when I pursued an issue raised by them, my Avast security software stopped a virus
 arriving from their fixing service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this company anything to do with Microsoft?&nbsp; How can I get rid of it/them?</p>

<br />
<br />Is this website appearing in Edge when Edge starts up, or as a full web page during your session in Edge, or just popups at the side of Edge?

            Hi Pam,
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this annoyance for you. MalwareBytes will pick up a different type of malware that Avast will not even see . . .

            Here is what I did - so far so good. Hope it is a permanent fix.<br />
1. Open Edge and click the three dot menu in the upper right<br />
2. Scroll down to Advanced Settings &amp; click View Advanced Settings<br />
3. Scroll down to Website Permissions &amp; click Manage<br />
4. Scroll down the list and delete&nbsp;<em><strong>windows10portal.com</strong></em> and any others you don't want/recognize<br />
<br />
I also did a search of MY PC and found 3 entries for <strong><em>windows10portal.
</em></strong>Deleted all 3. So far it is working for me. Hope this is a solution.<br />
By the way - I think I picked this up trying to download what I thought was a version of Google Earth for Windows 10.

            Links to your laptops drivers are below. Most Vista drivers work with Windows 7, but not all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If one wont work try to Troubleshoot Compatibility<br />
<br />
This can help with some (but not all):<br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.<br />

<h2>            Update KB2952664 and Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anybody can help with this query?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking into why I didn't have the 'Get Windows 10' app on my desktop. I ran the Windows Troubleshooter, and I get a message saying &nbsp;KB2952664 is not installed, and it gave me a link to the microsoft upgrade catalogue to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the update and clicked on the link that it gave me, but this said that the update was already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then followed this suggestion from the troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>from the Start menu or screen, search for&nbsp;</span><span>cmd</span><span>,
 right-click on&nbsp;</span><span>Command
 Prompt</span><span>&nbsp;in the results and select&nbsp;</span><span>Run
 as administrator</span><span>. Type or paste the command&nbsp;</span><span>dism
 /online /get-packages | findstr 3035583</span><span>&nbsp;– if the update is installed, you will
 get a return with&nbsp;</span><span>Package
 identity</span><span>&nbsp;followed by a string of information. If nothing is returned, the update
 is not installed, and you need to check for updates and install it.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Windows 7:</span>&nbsp;also run the command&nbsp;<span>dism
 /online /get-packages | findstr 2952664</span><br />
If this update is not installed, install it now.&nbsp;</li><li>The following screen then appeared</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anybody can help with this query?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking into why I didn't have the 'Get Windows 10' app on my desktop. I ran the Windows Troubleshooter, and I get a message saying &nbsp;KB2952664 is not installed, and it gave me a link to the microsoft upgrade catalogue to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the update and clicked on the link that it gave me, but this said that the update was already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then followed this suggestion from the troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>from the Start menu or screen, search for&nbsp;</span><span>cmd</span><span>, right-click on&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt</span><span>&nbsp;in
 the results and select&nbsp;</span><span>Run as administrator</span><span>. Type or paste the command&nbsp;</span><span>dism /online /get-packages | findstr 3035583</span><span>&nbsp;–
 if the update is installed, you will get a return with&nbsp;</span><span>Package identity</span><span>&nbsp;followed by a string of information. If nothing is returned, the update is not installed, and
 you need to check for updates and install it.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Windows 7:</span>&nbsp;also run the command&nbsp;<span>dism /online /get-packages | findstr 2952664</span><br />
If this update is not installed, install it now.&nbsp;</li><li>The following screen then appeared</li></ol>

<h2>            MaxxAudio Wizard disappeared and audio gone weird</h2>
                    So i recently got windows 10 and after installing my audio has gone weird. I have a Asus rog g750 which has a mini subwoofer, after the update it doesnt seem to be working and my audio sounds tinny. when I went to look at different settings I found that
 my MaxxAudio wizard had completely disappeared. i couldnt really find a trace of it anywhere on my computer. As it worked fine before the update Im sure my hardware is fine, just an issue with drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other than my audio windows 10 has been really great, I hope I can fix it soon.<br />
<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I attempted all 3 methods but the first 2 couldn't find any issues and the last one didn't change anything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think windows 10 might have deleted my maxxaudio wizard, as my computer also has a realtek audio management system. The maxxaudio wizard greatly inproved my audio and made good use of my internal subwoofer but with it gone I dont think my subwoofer is even
 being used.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can provide more information if you tell me what you need.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
